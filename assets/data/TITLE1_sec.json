We do this by providing the tools and services that help the employees to get feedback, plan personal development, and take action.\\n\\nWe’re now the&nbsp;top-rated tool in the 360° Feedback market, used in 134+ countries by thousands of organizations (inc. 3M, Cisco, Fitness First, JLL, Médecins Sans Frontières, New Look, Pandora and Pepsi) to nurture and develop their employees.&nbsp;\\n\\nWe're looking for talented developers to help us make those organizations even more successful. You’ll be helping us to deliver even better user-experiences, frequently requested features, and cutting-edge personal development tools.&nbsp;\\n\\nIf you are a software developer who values code quality, wants to grow by working in a small and experienced team, and in doing so wants to help real customers to achieve their goals, then read on…\\n\\n\\n\\nWho we’re looking for\\n\\nAt Spidergap, we're fueled by the passion and exceptional talent of a successful start-up. We're hungry to amaze our customers, grow the business, and to continue growing as individuals and a team.

We are quick to raise issues and ideas, and to recommend next steps. We make it easier for others to feel they can depend on us by being proactive in our communication and action.\\n\\n* Pay attention to detail:&nbsp;We believe the quality of everything we do is a competitive advantage. We expect high attention-to-detail, whether it's in how we write an email, review our analytics, or design the site. We delight in getting the details right, even in internal documents. High attention to detail isn’t something you turn on and off — it’s an attitude.&nbsp;\\n\\n* Always look to improve:&nbsp;We survive and grow by constantly looking for opportunities to improve our solutions, our processes and ourselves. We own our mistakes, using them as an opportunity to learn what changes we should make to processes and tools. We expect our people to proactively look for opportunities to develop and improve our own performance.\\n\\n* Enjoy the journey:&nbsp;We consider our health and families to be more important than work. We ensure no-one feels that they are frequently required to work excessive hours. We support each other in overcoming problems and achieving work and life goals. We’re positive and enthusiastic — helping everyone feel energized to take us to the next level. We don’t pin our happiness on the attainment of a particular end goal - we delight in every step along the way.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe don’t just ‘say’ these are our values. We use them all the time — to recruit the right people, manage individual performance, recognize good practice, and make decisions.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nIs the role right for you?\\n\\nA large part of the work will be developing and supporting new functionality using NodeJS, MySQL, GraphQL and React.\\n\\nWe use&nbsp;“clean” code, agile processes and continuous integration tools to efficiently take features from concept to roll-out, and to continuously optimize our processes.
