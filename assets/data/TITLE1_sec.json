Stitch Fix is a fast-growing company, and our security program needs to be able to keep pace with that growth while not disrupting innovation. You will help us improve our vulnerability scanning and develop API integrations (glue code) between various systems and solutions. You will prototype, implement, test, deploy and maintain stable engineering solutions. You will present possible technical solutions to various stakeholders, clearly explaining your decisions and how they address real user needs, incorporating feedback in subsequent iterations.</p>\n <p>We cannot succeed without creative security engineers. Your cross-functional team will propose and build solutions for warehouse process improvement, workforce management, logistics decision-making, and workflow optimization.</p>\n <p><strong>REQUISITE SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Building and growing a next-generation vulnerability management program</li>\n  <li>Identifying the right combination of people, process and technology to improve our detection and remediation capabilities</li>\n  <li>Conducting scheduled, targeted (in response to advisories and remediation verification) and ad-hoc vulnerability scans and investigate and validate risk levels associated with vulnerabilities identified</li>\n  <li>Providing remediation guidance and recommendations and coordinate with the Technology organization, IT and other teams as needed to provide oversight to the remediation and/or mitigation of enterprise vulnerabilities</li>\n  <li>If necessary, act as primary security liaison and initial response for engineering and technology teams during security events and provide the necessary expertise in response and coordinating with the rest of the security team</li>\n  <li>Maintain and improve upon, as necessary, the existing vulnerability management infrastructure, including maintenance of scanning tools, licensing, procedures, reporting, and associated communications (downtimes, upgrades, report changes, etc.)</li>\n  <li>Create processes and workflows for all aspects of vulnerability management.

We are looking for an experienced security engineer to help us identify the biggest IR opportunities and to work with our security and IT teams to build solutions that address those opportunities.</p>\n <p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>\n <p>The Tech team is a small, diverse team that develops and supports the technology used by candidates and organizers in all 50 states and all 3,413 counties across the United States to analyze data, organize campaigns, raise money, and get out the vote on election day.</p>\n <p>But there’s more to do. So we’re hiring product managers, engineers, researchers, designers, security experts, IT professionals, and data scientists who can use user-centered design and rapid iteration to develop a rich technology ecosystem for progressives—building tools ourselves as well as partnering with other companies and organizations.</p>\n <p><strong>Do you want to…</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Secure the future of our country?&nbsp;</strong>Right now a lot is at stake in our country and our team has a huge opportunity to make a real difference.</li>\n  <li><strong>Work with amazing people?</strong>&nbsp;We’re building a diverse, distributed team, hiring the best people we can wherever they are—alumni from past Presidential campaigns working out of DC and New York, experienced product developers from the SF Bay Area, and more.</li>\n  <li><strong>Never stop learning?</strong>&nbsp;There are people who know about politics and people who know about technology and a few who have figured out some things about how to combine the two, but we are blazing a lot of new trails and you should be comfortable exploring and learning from everyone you can.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>You will…</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Lead</strong>&nbsp;efforts around log aggregation and analysis, incident detection, response, and recovery</li>\n  <li><strong>Deploy and maintain&nbsp;</strong>security systems in production</li>\n  <li><strong>Automate</strong>&nbsp;routine tasks through coding</li>\n  <li><strong>Evolve</strong>&nbsp;our incident response plans and protocols</li>\n  <li><strong>Provide actionable metrics</strong>&nbsp;to keep the work on track</li>\n </ul>\n <p>We are looking for a hands-on incident response engineer who can evolve our IR processes and technologies in light of today’s threat landscape. You’ll take our existing systems and processes and mature them in close partnership with other security engineers, system administrators, executives, and legal team members. You’ll develop ways to test our response capabilities through use of various tools, as well as through projects with red teams. You’ll use your previous experience with Linux, desktop OSs, Splunk, IOT, and coding on a routine basis. Other useful skills include threat modeling, risk management, threat hunting, and security frameworks like NIST CSF.</p>\n <p>We don’t require previous experience in politics. If you are coming from industry, however, be aware that some things are different in the world of politics: while we’ve done some budget hacking so we can be competitive when it comes to salaries we know we can’t beat Google or Facebook. On the other hand, you might legit help save the world.</p>\n <p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC), is committed to diversity among its staff, and recognizes that its continued success requires the highest commitment to obtaining and retaining a diverse staff that provides the best quality services to supporters and constituents. The DNC is an equal opportunity employer and it is our policy to recruit, hire, train, promote and administer any and all personnel actions without regard to sex, race, age, color, creed, national origin, religion, economic status, sexual orientation, veteran status, gender identity or expression, ethnic identity or disability, or any other legally protected basis.
