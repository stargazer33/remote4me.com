Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if you meet these criteria:</p><p>You care deeply about building secure products in secure ways that simplify the lives of millions of people through automation.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p><strong>You have deep infrastructure security experience.&nbsp;</strong>Keeping the cloud resources that support our core Zapier application secure is at the heart of this role. Zapier is a SaaS product, so experience building software and managing cloud infrastructure under a similar model is a big plus.</p><p><strong>You know what makes browsers and sites secure.</strong>&nbsp; The web browser is practically the operating system of the internet; these days nearly everything that happens online, happens in a browser.&nbsp; You’ll help us continue to keep customer data safe by ensuring the “first mile” is trouble-free.</p><p><strong>You love writing software and building infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;Most of what you’ll do each day is guiding, building and maintaining Zapier's infrastructure and product. You'll focus on high value, high risk portions of Zapier. You'll use code to automate and improve the more mundane parts of auditing and monitoring of internal processes, as well as in the product.</p><p><strong>You have worked with teams before on large Python, AWS, &amp; Kubernetes projects.</strong>&nbsp;You’re also familiar with some common frameworks for languages like Django, Flask, or Rails. You've also worked extensively in cloud providers like AWS, GCE, or Azure and have strong experience with threat detection tooling on linux.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You love doing things efficiently. At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business.&nbsp;</strong>We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves. You'll be in a unique position to find and eliminate &quot;insecure and painful&quot; experiences and replace them with &quot;secure and joyful&quot; experiences.</p><p><strong>You love learning.&nbsp;</strong>Engineering is an ever-evolving world. You enjoy playing with new tech and exploring areas that you might not have experience with yet.</p><p><strong>You love to set your own direction.&nbsp;</strong>At Zapier, we have one team meeting each week and one-on-one meetings every month. Between those we chat in Slack and then go make things happen.</p><p><strong>You are friendly and patient, welcoming, considerate, and respectful.</strong>&nbsp;Learn more about these attributes in our<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fzapier.com%2Fjobs%2Fzapier-code-of-conduct%2F&amp;utm_source=zapier.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=zapier' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;code of conduct</a>.</p><p><strong>Things You Might Do</strong></p><p>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:</p><ul><li>Write some python and work within ansible, terraform, AWS and more.</li><li>Identify where we can add more layers of defense in depth and implement them.</li><li>Regularly play a role in red team / blue team type of activities and see what threats you can expose in our cloud and server stack.&nbsp;</li><li>Build internal tooling to ensure safe data access patterns for Zapier employees.</li><li>Review code across Zapier's product and infrastructure.</li><li>Locating weak points across Zapier and strengthening them.</li><li>Ship code to millions of users every week.</li><li>Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change</li></ul><p>As part of our<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fzapier.com%2Flearn%2Fcustomer-support%2Feveryone-on-support%2F&amp;utm_source=zapier.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=zapier' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;All Hands Support</a>&nbsp;initiative, help customers have the best experience with Zapier as possible.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Whole Package</strong></p><p>Location: Planet Earth.</p><p>If you want to work remote, that's great. If you want to work near others, that's cool too. Our team of 100+ is distributed because it lets us work with the best people. You don't have to be located in the USA either. Some team members live in the United Kingdom, Thailand, India, Nigeria, Taiwan, Guatemala, New Zealand, Australia, and more! You just need the skills and drive to succeed in this role and the ability to work from anywhere.</p><p>Compensation:</p><ul><li>Competitive salary (we don't use remote as an excuse to pay less)</li><li>Great healthcare + dental + vision coverage*</li><li>Retirement plan with 4% company match*</li><li>Profit sharing</li><li>2 annual company retreats to awesome places</li><li>14 weeks paid leave for new parents of biological or adopted children</li><li>Pick your own equipment. We'll set you up with whatever Apple laptop + monitor combo you want plus any software you need.</li><li>Unlimited vacation policy. Plus we require you to take at least 2 weeks off each year. We see most employees take 4-5 weeks off per year. This isn't a vague policy where unlimited vacation means no vacation.</li><li>Work with awesome companies around the world.

With multiple successful products, and our vocal advocacy for blockchain technology, we have played a major part in mainstream awareness and adoption of cryptocurrency. We are proud to offer an entire suite of products that are helping build the crypto economy, and increase economic freedom around the world.</p><p>There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we assess whether a candidate demonstrates our values: Clear Communication, Positive Energy, Efficient Execution, and Continuous Learning. Second, we look for signals that a candidate will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, disrupt ourselves, and expect sustained high performance because we play as a championship team. Finally, we seek people with the desire and capacity to build and share expertise in the frontier technologies of crypto and blockchain, in whatever way is most relevant to their role.</p><p><strong>Security Operations Team (Threat Intelligence)</strong></p><p>Security is a primary competency at Coinbase, and the Security Operations team keeps a watchful eye over every aspect of it. Every day, we go to battle against some of the most sophisticated attackers in the world to protect billions of dollars worth of digital assets and ensure that our customers and employees can enjoy a safe, trusted experience. As Coinbase scales globally, our team is scaling along with it, using a blend of tooling, automation, and strategic team growth to ensure that we’re well-equipped to protect the next billion users of crypto.</p><p><strong>What you’ll be doing:</strong></p><p>The Security Operations group is a multi-functional organization that includes our CSIRT, Trust &amp; Safety, and Threat Intelligence. While no two days will end up looking the same, generally-speaking you’ll be responsible for the following things:</p><ul><li>Tracking APTs and other threat actors targeting the crypto community and broader financial industry, and providing actionable intelligence to our CSIRT and security partners.</li><li>Researching emerging attack trends, and uncovering attacker infrastructures and tools.</li><li>Monitoring and analyzing in-the-wild exploits and attacks against other crypto exchanges, determining attribution to a particular threat group, and working with our CSIRT to develop detections accordingly.</li><li>Sharing your most interesting findings via the Coinbase blog, internal and external presentations, and threat reports.</li></ul><p><strong>What we look for in you:</strong></p><p>Some security teams have strict requirements about certifications, degrees, years of experience, and things like that. Not us! We’re more interested in the unique perspectives and expertise you’ll bring to the team, rather than the acronyms on your resume. However, you’ll be much more likely to be successful in this role if these bullet points seem like a good description of you:</p><ul><li>You’ve been doing novel security and threat research for a long time, and you’ve got a strong track record for your talks being accepted at places like DEFCON and Blackhat.</li><li>You regularly map attacks back to specific adversaries based on TTPs, and use OSINT and threat intelligence sources to understand APT-level adversaries and their capabilities. You effectively communicate this knowledge to the team and to the rest of the security research community.</li><li>You’ve built strong professional networks and periodically present your work through blogging, conferences, and occasionally through media publications.</li><li>You use large-scale datasets and sophisticated queries and analysis as a regular part of your work, and can get access to unique datasets that aren’t widely available.</li><li>You’re comfortable working with ISACs and other threat-sharing groups.</li></ul><p><strong>Nice to haves:</strong></p><ul><li>You would bring a diverse perspective to the team: for example, maybe you took an unconventional route to get into your current security career.</li><li>You’ve got a passing familiarity with blockchains and cryptocurrency, or at least a good story about how you thought about investing in Bitcoin in 2014 but decided not to.</li></ul><p><em>Coinbase is committed to diversity in its workforce and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer and to review all of our job postings to minimize biased language.
