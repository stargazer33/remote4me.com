You will impact the business in tangible, visible ways that and always have a seat at the table.</p><p>We are looking for a Security Vulnerability Engineer for our Information Security team. Our team members are given a great deal of autonomy in the pursuit of keeping Stitch Fix secure. You will demonstrate strong communication skills and you will be primarily responsible for the continued evolution of our detection capabilities, the integration of security tools used internally by the Stitch Fix Information Security team, and the advancement of our vulnerability management program.</p><p>We’re looking specifically for folks who place an emphasis on usable security. Stitch Fix is a fast-growing company, and our security program needs to be able to keep pace with that growth while not disrupting innovation. You will help us improve our vulnerability scanning and develop API integrations (glue code) between various systems and solutions. You will prototype, implement, test, deploy and maintain stable engineering solutions. You will present possible technical solutions to various stakeholders, clearly explaining your decisions and how they address real user needs, incorporating feedback in subsequent iterations.</p><p>We cannot succeed without creative security engineers. Your cross-functional team will propose and build solutions for warehouse process improvement, workforce management, logistics decision-making, and workflow optimization.</p><p><strong>REQUISITE SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE</strong></p><ul><li>Building and growing a next-generation vulnerability management program</li><li>Identifying the right combination of people, process and technology to improve our detection and remediation capabilities</li><li>Conducting scheduled, targeted (in response to advisories and remediation verification) and ad-hoc vulnerability scans and investigate and validate risk levels associated with vulnerabilities identified</li><li>Providing remediation guidance and recommendations and coordinate with the Technology organization, IT and other teams as needed to provide oversight to the remediation and/or mitigation of enterprise vulnerabilities</li><li>If necessary, act as primary security liaison and initial response for engineering and technology teams during security events and provide the necessary expertise in response and coordinating with the rest of the security team</li><li>Maintain and improve upon, as necessary, the existing vulnerability management infrastructure, including maintenance of scanning tools, licensing, procedures, reporting, and associated communications (downtimes, upgrades, report changes, etc.)</li><li>Create processes and workflows for all aspects of vulnerability management.
