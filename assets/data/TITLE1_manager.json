In that time, we’ve grown. What started with me pecking away at a keyboard all by my lonesome has turned into a company with nearly 40 employees scattered around the globe. And we’re continuing to grow at a healthy pace.<br><br>But I need your help.<br><br>We've been able to build a completely remote company with a phenomenal culture and happy employees.

So we need someone like you to work full-time to maintain our happiness.<br><br>Can you help us to continue to grow and to enjoy our jobs more?<br><br>**REQUIREMENTS**<br><br>Here's some of what you'll be expected to do:<br><br>* Think of new ways to delight remote employees<br>* Oversee our benefits and manage them in conjunction with Justworks (our PEO)<br>* Help ensure job postings and interviews are fair and inclusive<br>* Make sure new employees feel supported even before they start<br>* Work with other folks to organize company retreats<br>* Find ways to keep the pulse of employee morale<br>* Keep me informed of issues so we can solve them together<br>* You're all about ethics, and you want to be sure we're always on the right side of employment laws<br><br><br>Experience in these areas will help:<br><br>* You've helped other managers get better at their jobs<br>* You know your way around insurance (PPO, HMO, and POS are more than just letters slurped from your alphabet soup)<br>* Extending job offers is something you can do in your sleep<br>* You've helped terminate enough people to know how painful it can be, as well as what to do in advance to avoid surprises<br><br>**BENEFITS**<br><br>And by the way?
