We’ve been working steadily to engage campuses since 2012. In 2018 we provided materials and resources to 439 college campuses with a total enrollment of 4.7 million students.</p><p>For most of our target states, local state directors lead nonpartisan electoral engagement outreach activities, primarily by building and maintaining partnerships with faculty, staff, administrators and students on college campuses. We also reach schools through partner organizations in states where we don’t have directors and through individual schools that inquire about getting CEEP support. We’ve developed useful resources for schools throughout the country, from specific engagement approaches to our nonpartisan candidate guides. Our <strong>At-Large Director </strong>would use these resources to guide schools in states where we don’t have existing directors toward effective electoral engagement.</p><p>Working across these states, the <strong>At-Large Director </strong>will utilize email, webinars, and more limited direct phone outreach to larger schools.

This person will also be in charge of our talent recruitment, development, and retention, alongside our Operations and leadership teams.</p><p>Our substantive work advancing our mission of protecting democracy is why we do what we do. But we believe just as deeply that in order to achieve our ambitious mission, we must build an organization rooted in a highly effective and supportive operating model. We, therefore, invest significant resources in building an intentional team culture and strong management systems. Our culture principles guide everything we do. We hire for them, train on them, reinforce them daily, and part ways with people for whom they are not a fit.</p><p>We believe that everyone at Protect Democracy is on a constant path of growth, and we invest in cultivating it for every team member by pairing them with a dedicated growth manager who meets with them weekly to provide coaching.</p><p>We believe our existing principles and systems have created a uniquely healthy culture, where people can work together and communicate with deep honesty in mission-focused ways, with far less political, bureaucratic or interpersonal distractions than are typical of the modern workplace. We also believe our focus on culture and management, and especially in hiring through this lens, have brought together a team of kind and compassionate people who support one another and make each other better.</p><p>As we scale, maintaining our culture and our management systems will be hard enough, but if we are to succeed they will also need to adapt. We are therefore hiring a full-time management expert and strategist to lead our work improving and strengthening our culture and management systems as we scale.</p><p><strong>The Head of Culture and Organizational Strategy will be expected to do the following and possess the following qualities:</strong></p><ul><li>Sophisticated understanding of organizational management strategies and tools and experience implementing organization procedures and organizational change successfully.</li><li>Ability to think deeply about organizational culture and turn that thinking and analysis into actionable plans to deepen and improve org culture.</li><li>Ability to envision future organizational paths and needs at C-suite level and be able to make hypotheses, crisply tee up decisions, make recommendations, and explain rationales.</li><li>Ability to anticipate and design efficient and effective hiring and retention processes that will result in bringing in diverse top talent that fits with org, grows with org and stays.</li><li>Excellent project management skills, including ability to develop project plans, manage teams, and prioritize and efficiently manage multiple project workstreams to successful conclusions.</li><li>Exceptional diplomatic skills and ability to build strong relationships, including with people from different backgrounds and ideologies.</li><li>Excellent critical thinking, writing and communications skills.</li><li>Passion for protecting our democracy and willingness to place that mission above all other professional considerations.</li><li>Basic understanding of the political-media landscape.</li><li>Comfort with full transparency on work and proactive managing up, down, and sideways to keep others informed at all times and comfort giving and receiving constant feedback in all directions.</li><li>Comfort taking smart, strategic, and calculated risks.</li><li>Comfort working in a collaborative start-up environment, doing whatever is necessary to build the organization and support your own work.</li><li>Comfort developing relevant metrics and then meeting them.</li><li>A healthy mix of idealism, sophistication and practicality, coupled with personal kindness and generosity of spirit.</li></ul><p><strong>About Protect Democracy</strong></p><ul><li>Commitment to a diverse workplace. Protect Democracy is an equal opportunity employer. Our culture principles emphasize that there is strength in diversity as we believe diverse teams are more innovative, creative, and productive. Protect Democracy encourages applications from all qualified individuals without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, national origin, marital status, citizenship, disability, and veteran status.</li><li>Competitive pay and phenomenal benefits. All positions are<strong>&nbsp;full-time&nbsp;</strong>and offer a salary and benefits that are commensurate with experience and designed to be at the leading edge of competitiveness for the social justice and non-profit sector. While we cannot match for-profit sector salaries, our intent is to not make finance a bar to people who want to do this work on the theory that paying for top talent will result in greater delivery of impact towards our mission. For example, our benefits package includes three months of paid parental leave, a 401k plan in which we match employee contributions dollar for dollar up to 6% of salary, and full coverage for an excellent health care plan.</li><li><strong>Open to applicants from all over the country. Location requirements are flexible. The only requirement is that your location be one that allows you to complete the demands of the position and mission. We currently have staff in DC, New York, California, Boston, Michigan, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia.</strong></li><li>Ample opportunities for personal &amp; professional development. Candidates who do not meet all listed criteria should still apply, as our organizational structure focuses on providing mentorship and opportunities for professional growth.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://protectdemocracy.org/x/jobs/head-of-culture-and-organizational-strategy/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Machines are increasingly awesome at understanding English, but what about the 5+ billion people who need to communicate in their native language?</p><p>Sinitic automates multilingual customer support with a vertically-integrated product suite and proprietary Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine for Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai and other languages. Our core tech includes IP for mixed-language understanding and semi-supervised chat history structuring (we really love NLP).

At its core, this role is about strategically multiplying the department’s human resources in order to punch above its weight globally, and win then grow key accounts.

We’re looking for a collaborative but hands-on Release Manager to help us scale our execution to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p><p>Analytics Fire is a deeply technical engineering organization. Most of us are software engineers and spend the majority of our time on heads down engineering activities like coding. Our goal in creating this position is to expand our small client-facing team with a unique person that has both the personality and the technical skillset to help guide software releases through planning, development, deployment, release, and DevOps processes.</p><p>This position is similar to that of a technical Program Manager, but you will be much more involved in the technical details and hurdles around software deployments and releases than a traditional Project Manager would be. Our ideal candidate is a current or former Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Site Reliability Engineer that is willing to be trained in formal Program Management processes (or has already been trained in formal Program Management processes).</p><p>As a small company, Analytics Fire is able to tailor roles around the strengths of our individual team members. We will tailor this role to your specific technical background. However, it is a hard requirement that you are able to support the following 3 types of responsibilities:</p><ul><li>(a) Represent Analytics Fire software engineering teams in client-facing interactions (clarifying requirements, negotiating technical approaches, reporting on status, etc).</li><li>(b) Technical writing responsibilities such as documenting requirements, project plans, system architecture, etc.</li><li>(c) Making meaningful contributions to the execution of complex software projects.</li></ul><p>For reference, here is a list of some technologies we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p><ul><li>JavaScript: React / Angular /&nbsp;Typescript / GraphQL</li><li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node</li><li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li><li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li><li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li><li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li><li>Other technologies we are currently building with: AWS, GCP, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Yocto, Salesforce platform, iOS, ARKit</li></ul><p>Description of responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Develop and maintain well-coordinated relationships with key internal and client-side stakeholders to help drive decision making around production software releases and DevOps.</li><li>Participate in collaborative planning discussions and technical decision making early in the project lifecycle to ensure that key decisions are made with reliability, testability, and DevOps in mind.</li><li>Monitor and oversee coordination, integration, flow of development, testing, and deployment around multiple parallel projects and threads of engineering execution.</li><li>Drive planning and delivery of high quality software releases:</li><ul><li>Manage change control process during releases</li><li>Continuously improve company release processes</li><li>Proactively identify and mitigate risks and remove obstacles to releases</li></ul><li>Personally plan and participate in software release activities. Advise and support the team so that they can take on less critical releases on a day-to-day basis.</li><li>Continually integrate the QA team and testing engineers into both the requirements gathering and software development processes and report status to clients on a very frequent basis.</li></ul><p>This is a remote position but is only open to candidates living in the US or Canada. (Note: we may be open to US or Canadian citizens living abroad in US-overlapping time zones on a case by case basis.) We’re flexible about location and hours. We’re a really great match for candidate who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>“Must have” requirements:</p><ul><li>Soft skills necessary to develop and maintain well-coordinated relationships with key internal and client-side stakeholders to help drive decision making around production software releases and DevOps.</li><li>3+ years hands experience as a full stack Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Site Reliability Engineer, ideally within a commercial startup environment.</li><li>Familiarity with current modern best practices around software development, data engineering, and DevOps</li><li>Ability and willingness to familiarize yourself with the specific technical stacks that we use.</li><li>Superior organization and detail orientation.</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</li><li>Willingness to design, document, and evangelize new engineering processes to meet evolving organizational requirements.</li></ul><p>“Nice to have” requirements:</p><ul><li>Hands-on technical experience writing code in&nbsp;Ruby, Python, or JavaScript</li><li>Previous experience as a technical Program Manager.</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/206463?reset=False&amp;ra=17eXvp489bqg&amp;oqs=a%3D17eXvp489bqg' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Analytics Fire</h3>            <div><p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p><p>“We founded Analytics Fire to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

You might be the perfect fit for this full-time, remote position if you think quickly on your feet, have a knack for creative problem solving and revel in bringing a team together to exceed client expectations on each and every project.</div><div><br></div><div>Aeolidia is a “one stop shop” design agency that develops brands and creates story-centered ecommerce websites for designers, artisans, and curators that have made it past the startup phase. We pair our custom strategic Shopify websites with analytical insights to continually optimize clients’ sites, resulting in significant growth to their online retail sales.</div><div><br></div><div>Our employees are directly responsible for empowering awesome business owners to succeed, and are challenged with meaningful work that improves their particular skills. If this all sounds excellent to you, please keep reading to see if we might be a match to work together!</div><div><br></div><div><h3>About Us</h3></div><div>Aeolidia is a graphic design and web development agency that has been working with designer and artisan businesses since 2004. We’re the preeminent design team in our creative niche, and we dig deep into strategy based on information we get from each client’s website analytics while also truly understanding the branding part of it. We deliver a gorgeous AND powerful site every time.</div><div><br></div><div>A designer or artist’s story should be compelling to customers. We focus on storytelling for brands. This is about each business’s “why” and what makes them unique and irreplaceable to their perfect customers. Since we do business naming, brand vision and voice, brand graphic identity, copywriting, and photography in-house, we have the capability to craft a cohesive story without losing anything along the way.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a remote team of overachievers, united in our common goal of taking creative businesses to the next level by paving the way toward substantial increases to online sales.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>Now Let’s Talk About You</h3></div><div>As the Web Project Manager, you’re a leader, a creative problem solver, and a project manager all in one. You are energized by working with people and keeping projects moving forward. No stranger to delegation, your primary role is to oversee the entire creative process from start to finish. You’re a visionary who can clearly communicate ideas and expectations, as well as facilitate inspired and enthusiastic discussions, all while keeping the team focused and on track with project timelines and deadlines. Your clients’ success is your success – when they win, you win, too!</div><div><br></div><div>Here are just a few ways we see you being successful in the Web Project Manager role with Aeolidia:</div><div><br></div><div><h4>You’re a Diligent Achiever</h4></div><div>You work smartly to deliver a truly top notch experience to your clients. You seek unique solutions, meet each deadline, and just plain get things done. You are a reliable go-getter.</div><div><br></div><div>Capable, persistent, and resourceful, you never despair when you hit a roadblock or need to figure out something new. You give it a try, do the research, try try again, ask for help, test it out, succeed, then consider it a learning experience and a new tool in your kit.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>You’re a Curious Learner</h4></div><div>You know it would be easy to keep doing what has worked in the past, but you also know that technology changes quickly, each business is different, and what works in one case won’t be the best solution in others.</div><div><br></div><div>You stay abreast of advancements in design, technology, and each specialty area in your role. You value being at the top of your game, even as things change. You have big ideas, and you’re eager to figure out how to do them.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>You’re a Humble Expert</h4></div><div>It’s important that each member of our team approaches the client relationship from the mindset of a “doctor”—using their years of expertise and insight to prescribe the right solution. This is in sharp contrast to the “waiter” mentality of taking orders and doing what is asked of us.</div><div><br></div><div>You remember that each client knows their business better than you do, and that you have a lot to learn from them. You strike the balance by being authoritative but cooperative and open-minded. You are experienced and your role is to help guide your client down the path to their goal.</div><div><br></div><div>You are highly collaborative and function well within a team. You feel comfortable asking for help and being open about what you don’t yet know. And, in turn, eagerly show up and share the special knowledge you do have without being arrogant about it. You also facilitate a team environment where each member feels the same.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>You’re a Positive Ally</h4></div><div>You anticipate your clients’ needs and concerns, and take an active role in making them feel comfortable with their brand, their technology, and their next steps.</div><div><br></div><div>When you see a problem you can solve or help with, you leap to action to make progress toward a solution. You take as much responsibility for client dissatisfaction as you can, knowing that you’re the one guiding the relationship and setting expectations.</div><div><br></div><div>You find solutions that are more than just acceptable, but something the client is happy with, and that keeps your relationship with them on a good track.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>You’re a Creative Supporter</h4></div><div>Your work is meaningful to you. Making a website and getting money is not the satisfying part. You’re in this to watch your clients exceed their goals and feel proud to have contributed.</div><div><br></div><div>You care about and believe in your clients’ businesses. You have a personal connection that makes the journeys of designer and artisan businesses meaningful to you.</div><div><br></div><div>You understand, you relate to, you value and respect each client and their business. With every step on their project, you are aiming to propel your client to where they want to be next.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>A Day in the Life</h3></div><div>Now that we’ve covered what it’s like to work with Aeolidia, let’s chat about what you would be doing on an average day. The full-time Web Project Manager will work approximately 40 hours per week guiding the entire process for each of our client projects from start to finish. This includes gathering all needed information from our sales staff, communicating it to the team, creating and balancing realistic schedules between clients, and aligning scope and objectives with to-dos and milestones.</div><div><br></div><div>You will be responsible for a Client Care Specialist, a Project Assistant, and a team of designers and developers who each own a piece of the client project. You will be the main point of contact for each client, and your ultimate responsibility will be to guide your team toward reaching the desired outcomes of each project in a timely and cohesive manner, ensuring each client’s complete and total satisfaction and happiness.</div><div><br></div><div>Every position with Aeolidia is a remote one, meaning you get to work from wherever you are! This also means that you will be leading a remote team. There are no set schedules or hours. Flexible schedules that fit around your life are what we do best. However, of course we do expect all of our team members to meet their goals and project expectations, so we’ll have weekly meetings to check in on progress, celebrate successes and help clear roadblocks that have a tendency to pop up from time to time. We want to ensure you have every chance to be successful in this role and we’re committed to doing our part to make sure you are.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>You’re a Great Fit For Our Team If:</h4></div><ul><li>You can commit to working 40 hours per week.</li><li>You have a reliable internet connection which allows you to work from anywhere.</li><li>You’re an experienced and confident leader; you’ll be overseeing each client project, as well as the entire project team.</li><li>You’re comfortable delegating, and discussing project goals and outcomes, such as overall vision, goals and design.

The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:<br /><br />We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.<br />We support each other. If a process breaks or if you're struggling, you can always count on the people around you and the people far away from you, to help you get back on track.<br />We run on feedback: direct and transparent praise and constructive criticism, communicated with the best of intentions. There is no other way to learn!<br />Ideas and approaches are always judged on merit rather than source. We welcome discussions and challenges.

Where next?)<br /><br />The process<br /><br />The interview process will involve:<br /><br />A review of your application;<br />A 15-minute chat where we both can learn more about each other;<br />Homework assignment for us to get a sense of how you tackle problems;<br />Two rounds of on-site technical and cultural chats with the team. If you are not currently based in London, we would be happy to speak with you over video chat;<br />Final round to iron out any remaining questions you may have.<br />This process should take around two weeks, depending on diaries.",

    "content": "<h2> Head of Marketing</h2><div>Marketing<br></div><div>4 Hours Overlap with Chicago Time<br></div><div>Remote First Company<br></div><div>Company: Basecamp<br></div><div>Full Time<br></div><h3>Overview</h3><p>For the past 20 years, we’ve been passive&nbsp;arketers with a little&nbsp;.</p><em>m</em><em>m</em><p>We speak at conferences and on podcasts, we write books (REWORK, REMOTE, It Doesn’t Have to be Crazy at Work), we share our point of view on thousands of blog posts, we invented a framework (Ruby on Rails) that changed an industry, and we make products that redefine their categories (Basecamp, Highrise, etc.). And right now we’re working on something new that’s going to surprise people.</p><p>We’ve gotten by on strength of product, cult of personality, a unique point of view, running against the wind, and incredibly generous word-of-mouth promotion from our customers. We’re fortunate it’s been working. 20 profitable years in business is the proof. We’re naturally proud of that.</p><p>But we feel like we’ve begun to saturate our natural sphere of influence, our current reach. Passive marketing can only get us so far, and we have a desire to go further. Today, if we’re in the mix, it’s by chance, not choice. And because of that, we feel a bit invisible outside of those who know us already.</p><p>And it’s no surprise: We haven’t really advertised. Or made it easy for new people to find us online. Lately we haven’t explained our brand particularly well. Or thought much about how we’re perceived in the modern market. We don’t show up in places where potential customers hang out, and we haven’t gone far enough supporting and sponsoring events and like-minded organizations. Basically, we’ve never deliberately focused on actively getting the word out, making sure our brand is positioned properly in the market, or meeting customers where they are.</p><p>We lack a Marketing strategy with a capital M. It’s time to change that.</p><p>Moving forward, we want to be intentional about creating awareness (how do we introduce Basecamp to people who don’t know us?), prompting consideration (how do we get people who need a product like ours to consider us for purchase?), and driving conversion (how do we get people who are considering Basecamp to sign up, pay us, and start using our products?).</p><p>So, for the first time, we’re ready to hire someone to lead that charge and own that responsibility. We’re looking for our first Head of Marketing.</p><p>How’s that challenge sound to you?</p><p></p><strong>ABOUT THE JOB AND THE WORK </strong><br><p>Fundamentally, this job is about developing and executing a broad strategy to bring more people to the front of the funnel by increasing awareness and interest outside of what we’ve already built. We’re not looking for somebody to spend time on email drip campaigns or improving onboarding. While important, this role is much broader than that. This also isn’t a job for self-described growth hackers.</p><p>This is a role for someone who knows how to mix a wild idea with a practical pitch. Someone who’s eager (but not annoyingly so) to pick up the phone and negotiate a major partnership deal. Someone who has an eye for talent, a nose for bullshit, ears close to the ground, and the creative mind of a conductor. Someone who’s previously managed large spends and helped a brand transition through a similar process. Someone who recognizes an opportunity when they see one, but knows how to steer clear of high effort low reward mirages. You see things other people miss, and you know how to put leverage to good use.</p><p>And while we’ll support your strategy with a multimillion dollar budget and creative support from the CEO, you’ll start this process without a dedicated internal team. While we have designers, writers, and a data analyst occasionally available to assist, we don’t have a marketing department or spare staff focused on everything you’ll need to get done. This means you’ll initially be expected to identify, vet, choose, and manage external vendors or agencies to help pull off your plan. Building an in-house team is something we’ll discuss down the road.</p><p>While some may see this as a disadvantage, we think it’s a big opportunity. You’ll be able to pull in the best agencies, freelancers, shops, and creative specialists to help pull off the plan. You’ll bring us creative ideas we’ve never considered in the past. You’ll challenge our thinking and help us see ourselves in a new light.</p><p>In addition to big picture strategy, you’ll focus on practical day-to-day work like fielding sponsorship opportunities that come our way. Keeping an eye on analytics. Reaching out to groups, organizations, movements, events, and other brands we should be partnering with. You’ll also be expected to regularly detail progress, setbacks, and marketing insights for the whole company.</p><p>We’re aware that at many companies, this is a multi-person position. Someone focused on the marketing strategy. Someone else focused on brand. Someone else focused on partnerships and sponsorships. And so on. We’re not expecting a herculean marketing turnaround with a single person at the start, but we absolutely believe the right person can point us in the right direction, guide us, come up with campaigns, be resourceful enough to get them produced, manage the process, study the results, course correct, revamp, and try more things. We know someone has to own this, or we’ll end up where we are today.</p><p>Bottom-line, this is an impact position. In time, the business should look better with you on board. A clear case of before and after. You’ll help us be noticed, be seen, and be found. We should also feel better about ourselves with you around. This is a big responsibility and we are here to support you, cheer you on, and make it happen. We’ve talked about having someone like you on board for years, and now we’re finally ready.</p><p></p><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong><p>You’ve done this before. You can’t wait to do it again. You absolutely want to do it for us.</p><p>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We’ll often subject ideas to rigorous debate, so you’ll need to stand up for what you believe, but we remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.</p><p>Yes, you’ll need to learn how we work at Basecamp, but we’re also looking for someone to teach us how to work. And once we’ve figured that out, be able to share that story with the world. We should tell the story of how we changed our approach to marketing.</p><p>We’re not looking for a superhero who thinks sheer hours = good work. Excess doesn’t impress us – creativity and efficiency does. You’ll have 8 hours a day to work, and, we hope, at least 8 hours a night to sleep. What you do with the other 8 is up to you, never to us. You’ll report directly to the CEO.</p><p></p><strong>ABOUT OUR PAY AND BENEFITS</strong><p>The salary for this position is $181,000. You can read about how we set salaries .</p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fm.signalvnoise.com%2Fbasecamp-doesnt-employ-anyone-in-san-francisco-but-now-we-pay-everyone-as-though-all-did%2F' rel='nofollow'>here</a><p>Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived away from work. None are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours, ample vacation time, summer hours, fitness, wellness, food, education, and charity.&nbsp;.</p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbasecamp%2Fhandbook%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fbenefits-and-perks.md' rel='nofollow'>See the full list</a><p>Basecamp is a remote-work company so you can be anywhere, but you’ll need at least 4 hours of overlap with Chicago time in your normal work-day routine.</p><p>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Basecamp is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.</p><p></p><strong>HOW TO APPLY</strong><p>Please send an application tailored to this position. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Show us that future.</p><p>We want to get a sense of how you think. To that end, please use your cover letter to share with us your take on the following questions:</p><ol></ol><li>Tell us how you’ve taken an existing brand to a new place by revamping their approach to marketing. How would you begin to approach figuring out where we stand and where we should be standing?</li><li>Give us an example of a small-to-medium sized business that you think markets themselves particularly well? Who’s doing an outstanding job out there? And why?</li><li>Since you’ll need to bring in outside talent to get the job done, which creative agencies or freelancers do you think are doing particularly interesting work? And why?</li><li>Share an example of a time great marketing caught your attention and turned you into a customer.</li><li>Tell us about something you almost bought recently, but decided not to. What failed to convince you?</li><li>What’s inspired you lately? What’s the most creative thing you’ve seen or experienced in the last few years?</li><p>We value great writers, so take your time with the application. Keep in mind that we do not equate length with substance, so please keep your cover letter to fewer than 1500 words. Stock cover letters won’t do – tell us why you want&nbsp;&nbsp;job, not just any job.</p><em>this</em><p></p><strong>Go for it! </strong><br><p>We are accepting applications for this position until June 28th, 2019. We’ll let you know that we’ve received your application. After that, you probably shouldn’t expect to hear back from us until after the application deadline has passed. We want to give everyone a fair chance to apply and be evaluated.</p><p>We can’t wait to hear from you!</p><div> <a href='https://basecamp.workable.com/j/3BEF6D97B2' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a></div>",

We are looking for an entrepreneurial, ethical and curious leader to run every aspect of our day-to-day business operations – financial management, human resources, planning and data systems, IT, and thousands of other things that will change daily. We are a global team of 16 people providing seed funding and mentorship to thousands of youth-led projects in over 130 countries. The ideal candidate must be excited about designing systems that help people connect and work better, problem-solving in a global context, using data to learn and improve, and building a truly stellar organization behind youth leaders. We are based in Boston but open to strong candidates anywhere.</p><p><strong>ABOUT PEACE FIRST:&nbsp;</strong>Peace First was founded on a simple idea: if we are going to solve the world’s greatest injustices, we must support this generation of young people with the skills and commitments to solve problems by connecting across lines of difference with compassion, standing up for ideals and others with courage, and creating collaborative change. This is what we call peacemaking. Currently, there are 1.6 billion young people, ages 13-25, around the world. They care deeply about what’s going on, they have boundless ideas on how to solve injustices and are ready to act yet seldom are they asked by adults what they think or, better yet, supported in bringing their ideas to life. Few have access to tools, mentors, and resources to turn their insights into reality. This is the divide we bridge. Peace First provides a blended digital design platform where young people can imagine and create powerful innovations to solve real problems in the world. In addition to digital design tools, we provide mentors, connections with young people from over 130 countries, and small start-up grants that start at $250 and scale up to $25,000 as youth scale their work. All of this takes place on the Peace First platform — the world’s largest marketplace for youth-led social change initiatives. In order for us to achieve our long-term goal of supporting a movement of 2.5 million engaged, compassionate, and creative youth, Peace First is launching a $10 million Global Youth Investment Fund to provide the financial spark to support efforts for social change. It will be the single largest investment in youth social action…ever. A key element of our strategic plan is to build out our team of talented professionals. We actively recruit, retain, and develop a multicultural and dynamic workforce that effectively and efficiently meets the wide spectrum of young people’s needs across the globe. We believe that an inclusive and open environment fosters creativity, contributes to the quality of our work, and provides growth opportunities for all employees.</p><p>To that end, we are seeking individuals who are excited about fostering this inclusive culture and working in an entrepreneurial environment where there is an immediate opportunity to have tangible impact on organizational direction and achievement. We are a team based around the world who thrive in an environment that embodies and celebrates the following:</p><ul><li>Possession of a deep belief in the ability of young people to create change</li><li>Ability to adapt and apply skills to new and changing scopes of work</li><li>Eagerness for more responsibility and exposure to new challenges</li><li>Motivation to solve problems by taking initiative and trying new ways of doing things</li><li>Enthusiasm for connecting others to our mission and providing them with powerful experiences</li><li>Openness to working with others across diverse perspectives and backgrounds</li></ul><p><strong>POSITION OVERVIEW:&nbsp;</strong>The Director of Operations and Finance works closely with the CEO to ensure internal systems and resources align with organizational strategies and goals.

    "content": "<h2> Head of Marketing </h2><div><div>For the past 20 years, we've been passive&nbsp;<em>m</em>arketers with a little&nbsp;<em>m</em>.</div><div><br></div><div><span>We speak at conferences and on podcasts, we write books (REWORK, REMOTE, It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work), we share our point of view on thousands of blog posts, we invented a framework (Ruby on Rails) that changed an industry, and we make products that redefine their categories (Basecamp, Highrise, etc.). And right now we're working on something new that's going to surprise people.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We've gotten by on strength of product, cult of personality, a unique point of view, running against the wind, and incredibly generous word-of-mouth promotion from our customers. We're fortunate it's been working. 20 profitable years in business is the proof. We're naturally proud of that.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>But we feel like we've begun to saturate our natural sphere of influence, our current reach. Passive marketing can only get us so far, and we have a desire to go further. Today, if we're in the mix, it's by chance, not choice. And because of that, we feel a bit invisible outside of those who know us already.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>And it's no surprise: We haven't really advertised. Or made it easy for new people to find us online. Lately we haven't explained our brand particularly well. Or thought much about how we're perceived in the modern market. We don't show up in places where potential customers hang out, and we haven't gone far enough supporting and sponsoring events and like-minded organizations. Basically, we've never deliberately focused on actively getting the word out, making sure our brand is positioned properly in the market, or meeting customers where they are.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We lack a Marketing strategy with a capital M. It's time to change that.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Moving forward, we want to be intentional about creating awareness (how do we introduce Basecamp to people who don't know us?), prompting consideration (how do we get people who need a product like ours to consider us for purchase?), and driving conversion (how do we get people who are considering Basecamp to sign up, pay us, and start using our products?).</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>So, for the first time, we're ready to hire someone to lead that charge and own that responsibility. We're looking for our first Head of Marketing.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>How's that challenge sound to you?</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>ABOUT THE JOB AND THE WORK</strong></div><div><span>Fundamentally, this job is about developing and executing a broad strategy to bring more people to the front of the funnel by increasing awareness and interest outside of what we've already built. We're not looking for somebody to spend time on email drip campaigns or improving onboarding. While important, this role is much broader than that. This also isn't a job for self-described growth hackers.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This is a role for someone who knows how to mix a wild idea with a practical pitch. Someone who's eager (but not annoyingly so) to pick up the phone and negotiate a major partnership deal. Someone who has an eye for talent, a nose for bullshit, ears close to the ground, and the creative mind of a conductor. Someone who's previously managed large spends and helped a brand transition through a similar process. Someone who recognizes an opportunity when they see one, but knows how to steer clear of high effort low reward mirages. You see things other people miss, and you know how to put leverage to good use.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>And while we'll support your strategy with a multimillion dollar budget and creative support from the CEO, you'll start this process without a dedicated internal team. While we have designers, writers, and a data analyst occasionally available to assist, we don't have a marketing department or spare staff focused on everything you'll need to get done. This means you'll initially be expected to identify, vet, choose, and manage external vendors or agencies to help pull off your plan. Building an in-house team is something we'll discuss down the road.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>While some may see this as a disadvantage, we think it's a big opportunity. You'll be able to pull in the best agencies, freelancers, shops, and creative specialists to help pull off the plan. You'll bring us creative ideas we've never considered in the past. You'll challenge our thinking and help us see ourselves in a new light.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>In addition to big picture strategy, you'll focus on practical day-to-day work like fielding sponsorship opportunities that come our way. Keeping an eye on analytics. Reaching out to groups, organizations, movements, events, and other brands we should be partnering with. You'll also be expected to regularly detail progress, setbacks, and marketing insights for the whole company.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We're aware that at many companies, this is a multi-person position. Someone focused on the marketing strategy. Someone else focused on brand. Someone else focused on partnerships and sponsorships. And so on. We're not expecting a herculean marketing turnaround with a single person at the start, but we absolutely believe the right person can point us in the right direction, guide us, come up with campaigns, be resourceful enough to get them produced, manage the process, study the results, course correct, revamp, and try more things. We know someone has to own this, or we'll end up where we are today.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Bottom-line, this is an impact position. In time, the business should look better with you on board. A clear case of before and after. You'll help us be noticed, be seen, and be found. We should also feel better about ourselves with you around. This is a big responsibility and we are here to support you, cheer you on, and make it happen. We've talked about having someone like you on board for years, and now we're finally ready.</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></div><div>You've done this before. You can't wait to do it again. You absolutely want to do it for us.</div><div><br></div><div>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We'll often subject ideas to rigorous debate, so you'll need to stand up for what you believe, but we remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, you’ll need to learn how we work at Basecamp, but we’re also looking for someone to teach us how to work. And once we’ve figured that out, be able to share that story with the world. We should tell the story of how we changed our approach to marketing.</div><div><br></div><div>We're not looking for a superhero who thinks sheer hours=good work. Excess doesn't impress us - creativity and efficiency does. You'll have 8 hours a day to work, and, we hope, at least 8 hours a night to sleep. What you do with the other 8 is up to you, never to us. You'll report directly to the CEO.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>ABOUT OUR PAY AND BENEFITS</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>The salary for this position is $181,000.

    "content": "*Operations Manager*<br /><br />*TLDR: Do you love making stuff happen?*<br /><br />Hubbub is growing 100% year on year. We provide awesome fundraising technology for universities and charities. Fast growth can be tough on the joints that hold organisations together. We are now looking for someone with a passion for connecting the dots, making processes, systems, data, and people work together to deliver amazing results.<br /><br />We anticipate that you may have an unconventional career path. Great operations people are problem-solvers, thinkers, do-ers, fantastic communicators, not afraid to get their hands dirty but with a clear vision for overall direction and the insight for what change is going to matter. Value alignment, culture fit, and being able to showcase your skills - these are the things we’ll be looking for.<br /><br />*A bit more about the role*<br /><br />We have a lot of data, a solid finance function, a fair few disparate systems across Commercial, Technology & Product, and Customer Success teams, and a desire to join up, improve, automate (to catch up a little with the growth we’ve had), and prepare for the rapid growth that is yet to come.<br /><br />You’ll need to be confident and able managing a finance function - primarily in terms of processes, controls, data and metrics reporting. The finance layer underneath you works well, and data is accurate and relatively easy to access. But our financial data does not surface the insight we want right now - either to the company’s leadership, or to the business units that need it to inform their work. Overall responsibility for ensuring various important financey things are done on time sits with the company’s founders, and we’d like you to bridge this gap. In addition, we’d like you to extract and analyse the financial data so we can iterate processes and improve the information available for strategic decisions we need to take.<br /><br />The same pattern around data and insight exists elsewhere. There’s plenty of solid systems and processes - and reliable data - in our Technology, Customer Success, and Commercial functions. But we need to join these sources of insight and information up so that we can feed back the information into the teams that need it. Which product line is producing the best ROI for clients? How does it vary by country? What are the implications of this for our Marketing and Product teams? We can generate all this right now, but we’d like someone working ahead so that the actionable insights that matter to the business come to us before they become a problem for us to solve. In short: we want dashboards - not lots of them, but really good ones, that tell us in real-time what is working and what isn’t.<br /><br />We often have one-off projects that cross operations, finance and fundraising - such as managing the roll-out of options schemes, or closing the paperwork for an investment round. We’d like you to project manage these one-off larger projects, working with senior internal leaders (yes, this means telling them what to do, when, in some cases) as well as outsourced legal and accounting teams (creating plans to ensure outsourced work is done to a high standard on-time!). This doesn’t mean you need to be an expert in any particular area (though obviously a basic understanding of finance, investment and legal areas is useful) - it means you need to understand where the critical path is, be able to analyse the pieces of the puzzle, and put them together in the right order. You’ll always be well-supported if you’re unsure of next steps. <br /><br />We have a top-level annual growth plans and initiatives to deliver them that cover the period until end 2022. We also have operational plans in our Commercial, Technology and Customer Success functions that run to shorter timeframes. We need you to help bridge the gaps between these plans, sitting with business unit leaders both individually and as a group and creating and maintaining a mid-term operational plan that tracks interdependencies in key areas. That sounds quite jargon-loaded, so in simple terms, if the commercial team is proposing to generate £1m from a new product area in 2021, ensuring that the roadmap through 2019 and 2020 for technology is going to get the product ready, and ensuring that the customer success team have the materials and training to successfully deliver this product at scale. It’s not horribly complicated, but it does need regular attention to ensure risks and slippages are tracked and communicated.<br /><br />Finally, as a business grows it needs to constantly iterate tools, systems and processes - where to store key company information, how-tos, technical docs, what systems to manage information, contracts, CRM, project management, product roadmap, etc - as well as defining who is responsible for the set up, configuration and maintenance of these systems. We’d like you to come in and help us rationalise our software and subscription systems to ensure we are both purchasing and using efficiently the right combination of tools to meet our needs.<br /><br />It’s probably worth saying right now that if there’s a good fit and great delivery in this role, we’ll be looking to promote you within the first year. This role can only grow, and if you’d like to grow with it, that’d be fab.<br /><br />About you<br /><br />It’s likely you have a strong ability in finance, some history with legal/contracts, an obsession with establishing, measuring, iterating and improving processes, and strong communication skills. If you have startup experience or fast growth experience that’s likely to help - especially if it was in an operations or finance role. <br /><br />*About us*<br /><br />We are a 50% London, 50% remote team. We operate with weekly OKR meetings against quarterly objectives, with weekly all-hands meetings - and the whole team gets together twice a year. There’s a dog in the office most of the time. She’s cute. Our people are giving of their time, energy and attention, we take our ability to have fun seriously, and we have an awful lot of grit.<br /><br />*Reporting to/Based in*<br /><br />You’ll be reporting to the COO, who is a founder, joining all the all company meetings, and also our senior coordination group. On a day to day basis, you’ll be working actively with the leaders of the Technology & Product, Commercial, and Customer Success functions, in addition to the CEO, COO, and leading the finance team.<br /><br />We anticipate that you’ll be based in our offices on Old Street, London. We’re open to flexible working both in location and times, but for this role, we don’t think a fully remote hire is going to deliver what’s needed.<br /><br /><br />To apply, please send your CV to talent@hubbub.net with brief answers to the following:<br /><br />* Why do you want the role?<br />* Describe your relevant experience and past performance.<br />* What type of work environment brings the best out of you?",

So expect to hear some unpleasant - but true - things sometimes. Don't hesitate to argue back - with respect - if you disagree.   <br>   <br>* Like any startup, It can be a mess some days. You also will likely have to do things that aren't in your scope sometimes. Part of the fun, right? ;)   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>The most important is: We are always looking at improving. All the time, step by step. If you feel mediocre and don't see a path to improvement or can't listen to others' voice to, please do not apply.  </div> </div>",

    "content": "<span><h2>Operations Manager&nbsp;</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>Ghost</h3></span> <span>Worldwide</span> <span></span> <span>verified</span> <div>  <div>   In the early days, everyone did everything. Then as we started to hire a few people, all the extra jobs outside of &quot;regular work&quot; - fell to our CEO, John. Now, as the company has grown a lot further, John is spread pretty thin and needs help managing and organising the logistics of running a remote company. That's what this role is all about!   <br>   <br>The Operations Manager role is a diverse one. At a regular company this might be referred to as something like &quot;Office Manager&quot; — but as a remote company, we don't actually have an office. Instead, we've got a different set of challenges which are reasonably unique to the type of business we've built.   <br>   <br>Primarily, the Operations Manager role has two core focuses: Organising team logistics to make Ghost a great place to work, and assisting John directly by helping to fill gaps in the company wherever things need doing.   <br>   <br>That said, this is a startup, so you should expect your role to extend to various parts of the business, as well as experiments and adhoc projects long the way. We're still a small team, so you'll be able to see - and contribute to - every part of the business from top to bottom.   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> *  Help to hire + onboard new employees, measure and improve team happiness, implement policies (PTO, parental leave, etc.), and administer payroll, benefits, and reimburse expenses.   <br>* ✈️ Research, organise, book, and project-manage our 9-day international team retreats every 6 months: Arranging everything from travel and accommodation, to daily schedules and supplies.   <br>* ❤️ Plan and implement useful systems and activities to help everyone stay organised, and foster camaraderie between our remote team mates.   <br>*  Handle accounts receivable/payable and help teams with various administrative tasks.   <br>* ⚖️ Be responsible for efficient meetings, workflows, documentation, and support for new tools we implement in the company.   <br>*  Do some customer support and assist our users directly whenever there are gaps in our global support cover which need extra help.   <br>*  Be the go-to person for questions from the Ghost Team regarding company policies and procedures.   <br>*  Assist John directly (and occasionally other team members) to allow them to be more productive, and better manage their time + workload.   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>**Obsessively organised.**&nbsp;This is the heart of the whole job, so we're on the lookout for someone who is already fantastic at organisation - and will be able to raise the bar of our overall organisational competence.   <br>   <br>**A creative problem solver.**&nbsp;Someone who can get things done even when there's no immediately obvious answer or process for how to do them - and is happy to take responsibility for delivering.   <br>   <br>**A people person.**&nbsp;This is definitely a role suited to a broadly extrovert / ENFJ type personality. You need to be great at understanding our team members, what motivates them, and what makes them tick. Empathy++   <br>   <br>**A great writer.**&nbsp;Not only does this role involve a lot of writing, but as a remote team writing is our primary form of communication. Clear, concise communication in native English is an absolute must for this role.   <br>   <br>**Tech savvy.**&nbsp;Ghost is a software company and, while this role doesn't require any specific technical or coding skills, it does require someone who is proficient and comfortable within that environment. We speak tech, and we work on tech, so it's heavily reflected in everything we do - and the tools that we use.   <br>   <br>**Independent.**&nbsp;You'll have quick team meetings each week as well as regular 1:1s with your manager, but beyond that it's up to you to get things done. All teams at Ghost operate autonomously, so you'll be expected to get things done without being directed. A background in contracting or freelancing can be a big help.   <br>   <br>This role would be particularly suited to someone with a background as an Executive Assistant who is looking to take on a broader role with more autonomy and independence, working remotely from anywhere in the world. It would also be very suited to digital nomads looking for a meaningful long-term role which can travel with them.   <br>   <br>We don't mind where you're based or what hours you work, but this role does require a bit of schedule-flexibility, as you'll need some working hours overlap with John at all times, and he tends to move around quite a bit.   <br>   <br>We value diversity of all types at Ghost and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We have as many people who speak German as we do English and our engineering team contains as many women as it does men. Some of us are single, others are married, while others are parents. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

    "content": "<h2> Head of Marketing </h2><div><div>Standart is hiring a head of marketing to develop and run our marketing operations. We publish a quarterly print magazine about specialty coffee culture catering to professionals and enthusiasts all over the world. Our magazine is our product, and the job is to ensure that it is enjoyed by as many readers as possible.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a role for someone who has run the marketing operations for a company with revenue at least €1mil and with a dedicated marketing strategy. At Standart, you’ll be running all our marketing campaigns and communications, and will report to the CEO. As the Head of Marketing, you’ll be responsible for the overall growth of the company.</div><div><br></div><div>Standart is a fully remote company. We have no central office, and no set business hours. Our team currently work in four different timezones, from the UK to Japan. You can work from wherever you like, but will need ensure at least 4 hours a week of overlap with Central European Time for team calls. This means someone who thrives on autonomy, and reacts to it with a high level of accountability. We need you to define your work habits, deliverables, schedule, and then follow through. We’re not interested in how many hours you work—we’re interested in the quality of that work.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re a small team, but we’re also a very close team, and trust and openness is important to us. Everyone on the team has an important role to play, and everyone has an impact.</div><div><br></div><div>Standart seeks to provide a work setting that allows you the support and encouragement you need to do your best work, and we encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>About the job</h3></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>The most important job for the head of marketing is to drive sales and revenue. We can create the most beautifully curated magazine in the world, but if we don’t sell it, no one will get to enjoy it.</div><div><br></div><div>This means the role requires someone who is enthusiastic about our company and our work and making sure as many people as possible get to enjoy it. At the end of the day, that is the goal. You’ll help strategise and implement a successful marketing framework to move us forward.</div><div><br></div><div>Marketing is not just about designing the best campaign. This role also requires the implementation of strategy and tactics and management on a daily basis, over a number of projects and day-to-day tasks. We’re looking for a T-shaped marketer who can have an immediate impact that achieves rapid measurable outcomes and long-term growth.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>What you might be working on:</h4></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Sales</strong></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>Increasing yearly revenue across subscriptions, wholesale accounts, and advertising.</span><br></li><li><span>Improving customer retention rates.</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Branding and strategy</strong><br></div><div></div><div><strong></strong></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>Developing and implementing a three-year marketing strategy and outlining metrics to measure success.</span><br></li><li><span>Developing and implementing branding guidelines for all our customer-facing communications.</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Management</strong></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>Completing performance and forecast reports.</span><br></li><li><span>Overseeing implementation of strategy and guidelines across all markets.</span><br></li><li><span>Design and roll out marketing training to team members and new hires.</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div>Your work will be a combination of smaller, recurring tasks, and longer-term, project-based tasks. Smaller tasks are often detailed and repeat on a regular basis; we expect you to develop efficient workflows to complete them, allowing you to balance day-to-day with project work. You will develop metrics, set targets, and instil a culture that values success.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s not just doing the work, but doing work that lasts.</div><div><br></div><div>The role carries a lot of responsibility. We have one core product, and the company’s existence depends on effectively marketing that product. You need to understand this responsibility, but approach your work systematically and calmly, with an eye to the future. Don’t stress the small stuff; it’s the long game that matters.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>About You</h3></div><div><br></div><div>We are a small team with varied responsibilities that feed into each other. At Standart, we all work to the same goal. We are looking for someone who has an optimistic and positive attitude, and avoids blaming and shaming.</div><div><br></div><div>You need to own the concept of being responsible for communicating our product. Unless you tell us otherwise, we will assume that you have what you need to get the job done. You need to be someone who thrives on autonomy and responds with a high degree of accountability.</div><div><br></div><div>You will have to learn how we work and adapt, but we also want to be shown new ways to work. Even though you will be ultimately responsible for our marketing efforts, there may be times when another course or route will need to be taken to achieve an outcome. We expect that you can commit to doing your best work even when things are less than perfect.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re not looking for someone who does their best work in a crisis situation, but someone who—through planning and routine—can avoid those crises and get the job done within a healthy number of work hours.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>Pay and benefits</h3></div><div><br></div><div>Standart is an EU company legally based in Slovakia. Based on a contract, we pay a progressive salary that will start within the range of €42k to €50k per year, depending on your experience and qualifications, and increasing to as high as €105k in increments corresponding to achieved milestones.</div><div><br></div><div>We understand that in order to do your best work, you need to be in good health, both physical and mental. We believe in providing ample time off, flexible working hours, and time for creativity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Standart offers 4 weeks of paid holiday per year. We don’t track your days off, but the team needs to know if you’re planning on not being available, so just let us know.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We offer other perks and benefits such as supporting you in continuous learning to expand your knowledge and inspiration, yearly team get-togethers in different cities around the world, equipment, quality reading, and excellent coffee.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>How to apply</h3></div><div><br></div><div>We are accepting applications for this position until June 21. We will let you know when we’ve received it, and will get back to you once we have had time to make an evaluation.</div><div><br></div><div>Please send us a CV and a cover letter introducing yourself which will give us a taste of what working with you will be like. About 800 words should do it. Be sure to let us know why you chose us, why we should choose you, and a little about how you would approach some of the example projects detailed above. As a print publication and fully-remote company, we value great writing and effective communication. Show us what you’ve got!</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking forward to working together.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more Sales &amp; Marketing jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Interview Schedule</span><br><span>Account Executive</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>USA</span></a></li><li><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Olark</span><br><span>Partner Channel Marketing Manager</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>United States or Canada</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

    "content": "<h2> Director of Operations </h2><div><div>Basecamp is hiring a director of operations to run the team responsible for all our technical infrastructure. Our suite of applications is served from a mix of our own servers in leased data-center space and cloud setups in Google Cloud and AWS. The job is to ensure that everything runs smoothly, the lights stay on, and we’ve prepared for bad luck with good planning.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a role for someone with experience running a team at least as big as ours and a multi-million dollar budget. You’ll be managing a team of seven and report to the CTO.</div><div><br></div><div>Basecamp is a remote-work company, but you’ll need at least 4 hours of overlap with Chicago time in your normal work-day routine.</div><div><br></div><div>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Basecamp is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>ABOUT THE JOB<br></strong></div><div>The most important job for operations at Basecamp is to keep the lights on. If our applications aren’t available, it doesn’t matter how well we’ve designed them, how clever we are at marketing them, or how good our support team is. Nobody wants to buy flaky.</div><div><br></div><div>This means thinking carefully about risk, making (and testing!) contingency plans, and expecting the worst. While this invariably invites a certain degree of conservatism, part of the job is also being open to what comes next. We used to run everything on our own machines, now we’re also in the cloud. You will help us weigh the trade-offs and mitigate the risks, while moving us forward.</div><div><br></div><div>While ops is the second biggest team at Basecamp (after customer support), it’s not so big you won’t have to get your hands dirty. This is a technical role as much as a managerial one. And we expect that you have a broad range of technical chops. Enough such that participating in an on-call rotation does not frighten you (because you will be part of it!). To manage the work at Basecamp, you need to know the work and do the work.</div><div><br></div><div>Here are some examples of what you might be working on:</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Prepare for the future</strong></div><ol><li>Propose a strategy for how we best serve our large, unsharded databases for Basecamp in the cloud. This could include benchmarking instances, working with consultants like Percona, and validating assumptions with the cloud provider.</li><li>Coordinate a cloud storage migration to move a couple of petabytes of data from Google to Amazon. Clarify how we verify that everything has been copied, how we may move back, and validating the resilience design. Work with our Security, Infrastructure &amp; Performance team to have programming changes made to the application logic.</li></ol><div><strong></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><b>Mitigate downtime</b><br></div><div></div><ol><li>Prepare a schedule of regular fire drills for fail-overs between cloud storage regions or applications on our multi-data center setup.</li><li>Wake up at 4am to act as incident lead on an outage, then write up the incident report and remediation analysis. Also, considering what lessons need to be incorporated into our crisis handbook.</li><li>Be available during evenings and weekends for occasional preventative maintenance.</li></ol><div><strong></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><b>Team management</b><br></div><div></div><ol><li>Conduct a 1:1 with an ops team member, discussing long-term career progression and short-term goals.</li><li>Run a weekly team call and to discuss upcoming and ongoing work.&nbsp;</li><li>Write a detailed heartbeat explaining the progress within ops over the last six weeks and a detailed kickoff explaining what’s coming up in the next six.</li></ol><div><br></div><div>A lot of the work on ops is reactive: dealing with an outage, setting up a new application, addressing a security vulnerability. And you’ll have a great team of veterans capable of dealing with much of that. Your job in addition to dealing with the day-to-day is to deal with what comes next.</div><div><br></div><div>We'll be looking to you to clearly define the roles within the ops team, build clear lines of accountability, set targets for our systems (should we be chasing 5 9s?), balance the reactive work with project work, and ultimately instill a resilience culture at Basecamp. It's not just managing the work, it's also bringing the vision of what the work should be.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a lot of responsibility and a high degree of criticality. Basecamp’s existence quite literally depends on the ops team’s ability to keep the servers running and the services available. But that’s only all the more reason that you know how to do this work while keeping and working calmly.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>ABOUT YOU<br></strong></div><div>Basecamp is a company of&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fm.signalvnoise.com%2Fmoonlighting-managers-aint-got-no-time-for-bullshit%2F' rel='nofollow'>moonlighting managers</a>. While you’ll be responsible for a sizable team, we’re not looking for a micromanager or a chief whip. Everyone at Basecamp is here to do the best work of their career, so we work on systemic problems and try to avoid individual blame.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for a clear systems thinker. Someone who reads a story about the intern dropping the production database and wonders not “what an idiot” but “how was this possible in the first place?”.</div><div><br></div><div>At the same time, you must be willing to own the concept of keeping the lights on. Unless you’re specifically raising the alarm to signal otherwise, we’ll expect that you have what you need and is able to do what needs to be done. Someone who thrives on a high level of autonomy and responds with a high level of accountability.</div><div><br></div><div>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous debate, but we remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, you'll need to learn how we work at Basecamp, but we're also looking for someone to teach us how to work. And once we've figured that out, be able to share that story with the world. There's no reason Ops at Basecamp can't have a public profile like we do with programming or design. You'll help us build one.</div><div><br></div><div>What we're not looking for is a superhero who might be able to put out five fires burning at once by working 80+ hours/week, but a candidate who avoids the drama by following sound building codes, performing regular inspections, and responding to incidents with a tight routine.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>ABOUT OUR PAY AND BENEFITS<br></strong></div><div>Our pay is within the top 10% of the industry, for the matched role and experience, based on San Francisco rates. This comes to a range at hiring of between $280,000 and $350,000, depending on your seniority and qualifications. No matter where you live.</div><div><br></div><div>Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived away from work. None are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours, amble vacation time, summer hours, fitness, wellness, food, education, and charity.&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbasecamp%2Fhandbook%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fbenefits-and-perks.md' rel='nofollow'>See the full list</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>HOW TO APPLY<br></strong></div><div>Please send an application tailored to this position that speaks to us. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Show us that future. We value great writers, so take your time with the application. There’s no prize for being the first to submit!</div><div><br></div><div>We’d like to hear about how you’d approach some of the example projects outlined in the description about the job. Imagine you’re doing the work and walk us through your thinking.</div><div><br></div><div>All that being said, don’t send in a copy of War &amp; Peace. We hire rarely at Basecamp, so when we do, there’s usually many applicants. Be kind to the people doing application triage and keep your cover letter to fewer than 800 words and the thoughts on project approaches below the same ceiling (for a total of 1600 words max).<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Go for it!<br></div><div></div><div></div><div>We are accepting applications for this position until&nbsp;<strong>June 7th, 2019</strong>.

    "content": "<h2>Director of Operations at <span>Basecamp</span></h2><div><span><i></i> Remote</span>         | <span> International </span></div><div>            <p>Basecamp is hiring a director of operations to run the team responsible for all our technical infrastructure. Our suite of applications is served from a mix of our own servers in leased data-center space and cloud setups in Google Cloud and AWS. The job is to ensure that everything runs smoothly, the lights stay on, and we’ve prepared for bad luck with good planning.</p><p>This is a role for someone with experience running a team at least as big as ours and a multi-million dollar budget. You’ll be managing a team of seven and report to the CTO.</p><p><strong>Basecamp is a remote-work company, but you’ll need at least 4 hours of overlap with Chicago time in your normal work-day routine.</strong></p><p>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Basecamp is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.</p><p><strong>ABOUT THE JOB</strong></p><p>The most important job for operations at Basecamp is to keep the lights on. If our applications aren’t available, it doesn’t matter how well we’ve designed them, how clever we are at marketing them, or how good our support team is. Nobody wants to buy flaky.</p><p>This means thinking carefully about risk, making (and testing!) contingency plans, and expecting the worst. While this invariably invites a certain degree of conservatism, part of the job is also being open to what comes next. We used to run everything on our own machines, now we’re also in the cloud. You will help us weigh the trade-offs and mitigate the risks, while moving us forward.</p><p>While ops is the second biggest team at Basecamp (after customer support), it’s not so big you won’t have to get your hands dirty. This is a technical role as much as a managerial one. And we expect that you have a broad range of technical chops. Enough such that participating in an on-call rotation does not frighten you (because you will be part of it!). To manage the work at Basecamp, you need to know the work and do the work.</p><p><strong>Here are some examples of what you might be working on:</strong></p><p><em>Prepare for the future</em></p><ol><li>Propose a strategy for how we best serve our large, unsharded databases for Basecamp in the cloud. This could include benchmarking instances, working with consultants like Percona, and validating assumptions with the cloud provider.</li><li>Coordinate a cloud storage migration to move a couple of petabytes of data from Google to Amazon. Clarify how we verify that everything has been copied, how we may move back, and validating the resilience design. Work with our Security, Infrastructure &amp; Performance team to have programming changes made to the application logic.</li></ol><p><em>Mitigate downtime</em></p><ol><li>Prepare a schedule of regular fire drills for fail-overs between cloud storage regions or applications on our multi-data center setup.</li><li>Wake up at 4am to act as incident lead on an outage, then write up the incident report and remediation analysis. Also, considering what lessons need to be incorporated into our crisis handbook.</li><li>Be available during evenings and weekends for occasional preventative maintenance.</li></ol><p><em>Team management</em></p><ol><li>Conduct a 1:1 with an ops team member, discussing long-term career progression and short-term goals.</li><li>Run a weekly team call and to discuss upcoming and ongoing work.</li><li>Write a detailed heartbeat explaining the progress within ops over the last six weeks and a detailed kickoff explaining what’s coming up in the next six.</li></ol><p>A lot of the work on ops is reactive: dealing with an outage, setting up a new application, addressing a security vulnerability. And you’ll have a great team of veterans capable of dealing with much of that. Your job in addition to dealing with the day-to-day is to deal with what comes next.</p><p>We’ll be looking to you to clearly define the roles within the ops team, build clear lines of accountability, set targets for our systems (should we be chasing 5 9s?), balance the reactive work with project work, and ultimately instill a resilience culture at Basecamp. It’s not just managing the work, it’s also bringing the vision of what the work should be.</p><p>This is a lot of responsibility and a high degree of criticality. Basecamp’s existence quite literally depends on the ops team’s ability to keep the servers running and the services available. But that’s only all the more reason that you know how to do this work while keeping and working calmly.</p><p><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></p><p>Basecamp is a company of moonlighting managers. While you’ll be responsible for a sizable team, we’re not looking for a micromanager or a chief whip. Everyone at Basecamp is here to do the best work of their career, so we work on systemic problems and try to avoid individual blame.</p><ul><li>We’re looking for a clear systems thinker. Someone who reads a story about the intern dropping the production database and wonders not “what an idiot” but “how was this possible in the first place?”.</li><li>At the same time, you must be willing to own the concept of keeping the lights on. Unless you’re specifically raising the alarm to signal otherwise, we’ll expect that you have what you need and are able to do what needs to be done. Someone who thrives on a high level of autonomy and responds with a high level of accountability.</li><li>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous debate, but we remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.</li><li>Yes, you’ll need to learn how we work at Basecamp, but we’re also looking for someone to teach us how to work. And once we’ve figured that out, be able to share that story with the world. There’s no reason Ops at Basecamp can’t have a public profile like we do with programming or design. You’ll help us build one.</li><li>What we’re not looking for is a superhero who might be able to put out five fires burning at once by working 80+ hours/week, but a candidate who avoids the drama by following sound building codes, performing regular inspections, and responding to incidents with a tight routine.</li></ul><p><strong>ABOUT OUR PAY AND BENEFITS</strong></p><p>Our pay is within the top 10% of the industry, for the matched role and experience, based on San Francisco rates. <strong>This comes to a range at hiring of between $280,000 and $350,000, depending on your seniority and qualifications. No matter where you live.</strong></p><p>Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived away from work. None are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours, ample vacation time, summer hours, fitness, wellness, food, education, and charity.
