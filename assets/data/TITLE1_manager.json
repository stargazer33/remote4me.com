Our goal is to help rid the world of bad software - not a small task! We believe that providing best-in-class customer support is just as important as the software and services we provide. Our support staff is the face of our organization - the manifestation of our ideals and love for our users.</p><p>We have grown slowly and remained agile for over ten years now, and that's something we really treasure. When you join our team, you join our circle of friends.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>Here are a few things we believe are required to do the CET Sales Support &amp; Special Projects job well.</p><p><strong>You are Accurate and Organized</strong><br>To be successful in this role you'll need to be&nbsp;<strong>focused</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>detail-oriented</strong>&nbsp;and good at&nbsp;<strong>self-management</strong>.

Being able to&nbsp;<strong>jump into a user's shoes</strong>&nbsp;(and walk around a bit) gives you the best perspective to help them.

The second portion of the work is other sales related projects where our team could use assistance.</p><p>You'll be a member of the Sales Team (also known as the Wow!

Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Head* *of* *Marketing*.<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />As Head of Marketing, you will oversee and deliver all marketing to continue growing the Switchee brand within the social housing sector and, as we grow, into other sectors (student housing, private rented sector) and geographies. You will be responsible for managing our external positioning and generating inbound leads to help us achieve our challenging growth targets.<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />* Set the marketing strategy and own all aspects of the delivery<br />* Help define how we communicate our mission and values to the outside world<br />* Oversee company rebrand & production of new website<br />* Deliver inbound leads at target volumes and against target CPAs<br />* Oversee PR & communications<br />* Generate insightful, thought provoking written content<br />* Brief partners to deliver engaging visual & press content<br />* Manage online and social media marketing & advertising campaigns<br />* Manage social media (Twitter & LinkedIn)<br />* Work closely with the sales team to ensure CRO<br />*Organise attendance at conferences – negotiating exhibitor plots and speaking slots<br />* Prepare quarterly and annual overviews and forecasts<br />* Build, train & manage a marketing team<br /><br />We are a company built on a strong technical foundation. You’ll need to grasp and communicate a technical solution with clients. We also expect you to work closely with Product Development to ensure our product evolves with the customer’s needs at the very centre.<br /><br />*Your* *experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:<br /><br />* At least 3 years B2B marketing experience and team management skills<br />* Bachelor’s degree from a top university<br />* Proven ability to develop and implement effective marketing strategies<br />* Strong analytical & numeracy skills with complete command of Excel<br />* Research skills to identify new potential customers and new market opportunities<br />* Knowledge of Hubspot and CRM software and systems<br />* Experience of a range of marketing tech applications<br />* Comfort talking in detail about the technology and processes required to manage marketing budgets at scale.<br />* A strong grasp of the relevance of “brand” & “DR” marketing<br />* Experience in a small & quickly expanding business<br />* Knowledge of the housing sector<br />*Experience working with Internet of Things devices<br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter by clicking the button below."

THEY DO GET STIPEND TO SURVIVE. THIS IS MAINLY A REMOTE POSITION. </p><p>It is probably the hardest thing to get anyone to work here because nobody wants to work for free. I get it.  But here at depositoffer.com you are at the brink of making history, no-one had ever designed a system to compete with the federal reserve when it comes to determining interest rate, but I did. And why ? YOU ASK. </p><p>BECAUSE I believe we can and we should have a say in our future monetary policy and not leave this to someone else. When the FEDS print money it makes everything &quot;cheap&quot;, but still no jobs as all the cheap money go to the stock market. Now banks take deposits from us and channel them to rich guys to buy stocks which in turn push the markets and pay pennies as interest. </p><p>Is that what you want to do seeing your deposits earning pennies and rich guys making buying selling stocks for nothing. What if the Feds decide to go NEGATIVE like in Japan ? How about the alternative, you decide how much to lend to the banks and tell the banks what they can do with your funds (maybe smartcontracts ?). </p><p>You will compete with the FEDS not just on rates but smarter way of using funds and without deposits banks are bankrupted as intermediaries. </p><p>So if you want to develop the patented technology that will one day disrupt the most powerful group of people (the FEDS) by giving the depositors some control on how they want to use their deposits then come and give me a hand. </p><p>I can't promise you will be rich but I can promise you that this will be different to any startup as the rules have not even been written yet. If you have ETHER, my depositoffer.com ICO is running take a look at <a href='https://token.depositoffer.com' rel='nofollow'>https://token.depositoffer.com</a> and submit your interest, payments is to be in DOT tokens. </p><p>USE THE SLACK CHANNEL BELOW FOR ALL INTERVIEWS.

    "content": "WE ARE LOOKING FOR A NEW BRAW BLOGGER!<br /><br />Interested in Events, brands, media, marketing? We are looking for someone to take over our social media platforms and be part of our awesome little team.<br /><br />Unfortunately it's unpaid, however, we have some amazing benefits, fun and crazy unique events, great opportunity to grab those connections and gain further knowledge in the events industry! <br /><br />Its flexible, work remotely and now and again grab a cheeky drink! <br /><br />INTERESTED? Give us a shout at info@brawbloggerevents.co.uk <br /><br /><br /><br />A little about us! <br /><br />Braw Blogger Events started because Edinburgh is defined as an international city, where small businesses and bloggers don’t yet have an opportunity to connect & network. There is a perceived lack of awarenesses in the power of blogging and there are opportunities for businesses to hugely benefit.<br /> <br />We identified that the city holds a high proportion of independent bloggers and small businesses who want to expand and grow as well as gain knowledge and insights into what happens behind the screen. This proposes a huge opportunity as networking provides knowledge exchange, something that bloggers and businesses covet.<br />BBE is therefore distinguished from other events as it aims to connect people from different environments but with similar interests.<br /> <br />This will help business marketing, help bloggers find their niche whilst providing connections, allowing brands to promote and sell their products. There will be potential career opportunities, as well as further promotion and understanding of independent and larger companies.<br /> <br />With the fantastic success of the Edinburgh Blogger Conference on the 17th of June 2017. Bringing all areas and different niches together, we have branched and decided to follow up events throughout the year. With a fantastic fun list all throughout 2018! <br /> <br />From networking events, gatherings and workshops. <br />But we bring the fun into these motivational and exciting days! We aren't an ordinary conference/event team! That's for sure!"
