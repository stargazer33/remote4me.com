Our systems are critical to software engineers all over the world and used in every industry. Our cross functional feature teams are responsible for the development and maintenance of various segments within our product portfolio. This includes the public registry, which serves packages to open source engineers and small teams, and npm enterprise, a single tenant registry as a service for medium to large organizations.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p><p>You are a strong technical leader with a passion for mentorship and product delivery. In leading this cross-functional team you will work in a creative environment tackling complex problems. Our work has far-reaching impact and you will play a critical role by driving the strategy and evolution of your team’s product portfolio and the growth of individuals in your team.</p><p><strong>Here’s the impact you’ll make and what we’ll accomplish together:</strong></p><ul><li>Support a modern software practice<ul><li>Ensuring adherence to good process, alignment with goals, and cohesion with team members</li><li>Improving the frequency and quality of iterations over time through process, tooling, and analysis of our systems holistically</li><li>Participate in development and evolution of standards, guidelines and recommendations</li></ul></li><li>Support a diverse team<ul><li>Made up of product management, design, engineering, and QA in delivering on key outcomes for our products</li><li>Developing our talent with 1:1 coaching, professional development, goal setting and performance management</li><li>Reinforcing our commitment to inclusion through improvements to hiring practices and stewardship of team culture</li></ul></li><li>Support the product strategy<ul><li>Building features and experiences that reduce effort for our customers and generate tangible value</li><li>Identifying opportunities for optimization, and leveraging data to drive continued enhancements</li></ul></li></ul><p>If these are elements you are excited about and are interested in helping npm guide and lead a cross-functional team dedicated to the mission of improving our products, this is the ideal role for you.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Need To Be Successful</strong></p><p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p><ul><li>Experience building / leading teams responsible for development, maintenance, and operation of large scale, distributed, web applications using Node.js and JavaScript</li><li>Experience leading a highly technical team in building SaaS products and services</li><li>Strong understanding of complex enterprise technology with the ability to introduce improved experiences and simpler processes</li></ul><p><strong>Great-To-Have</strong></p><ul><li>Customer-facing product experience, including: customer journey mapping, customer research and interviews, customer support</li><li>Demonstrated experience improving your team’s ability to deliver features at regular intervals that positively impact target metrics</li></ul><p><strong>Our Code of Conduct</strong></p><p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct here.</p><p><strong>Why You Should Join</strong></p><p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p><p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p><p><strong>Where We Can Hire</strong></p><p><strong>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico.</strong>&nbsp;We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/dc2e355d-84c9-46f2-b4fb-de3b47bbe4f3' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Our goal is to ultimately re-imagine the way building projects are planned, delivered and operated.<br /><br />We're currently working on some of the largest building projects in London (e.g. Renzo Piano’s Shard Place, Wood Wharf) and have grown from 5 to 35 people over the past year. We have ambitions to expand significantly, which means that we are looking for passionate and enthusiastic talent to join the team.<br /><br />We move at a high speed, and will provide you with immense opportunities for initiative, creativity and leadership. Our proudly diverse, international team is based in London, Sarajevo and Yerevan, and has a wealth of experience from construction management to computer vision and robotics.<br /><br />Your role<br /><br />We are looking for a hardworking and organised Project Coordinator to lead our ever-growing number of projects and to help navigate us through our expansion. You will be responsible for coordinating needs between our clients and our project teams, and for ensuring that everything we do is streamlined, and operates like a well-oiled machine.<br /><br />This role places you right in the middle of our project delivery as a critical interface between each of our teams and our clients. You will gain exposure to all areas of the business and will experience firsthand what it takes to scale up an AI startup.<br /><br />Throughout your time at Disperse, you will receive regular mentoring from different members of the team to make your experience at Disperse the best it can be.<br /><br />Some of the work that you might be doing includes:<br /><br />Overseeing project timelines, assuring required resources to successfully meet implied deadlines.<br />Liaising with clients to make sure the required information is communicated to the team swiftly and that new projects are onboarded at the desired pace.<br />Monitoring progress across all projects and solving potential issues.<br />Planning employees’ timelines across the projects according to weekly needs, and leading and organising the equipment inventory.<br />Taking part in the planning and preparation of our product launches.<br />Contributing to the development and evolution of our processes and ways of working.<br />Our culture<br />Ask anyone at Disperse what they love most about working here, and they'll probably tell you &quot;it's the people!&quot;, &quot;the team, of course&quot;, &quot;the people and the Hedwig owls in the offices&quot;.<br /><br />As clichéd as it may sound, we're very proud of the people we have and the close-knit, family culture we've built across London, Sarajevo and Yerevan. Despite the distances, we're united through the passion with which we approach our goals and the fun that we have along the way. We always look out for each other, no matter what. The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:<br /><br />We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.<br />We support each other. If a process breaks or if you're struggling, you can always count on the people around you and the people far away from you, to help you get back on track.<br />We run on feedback: direct and transparent praise and constructive criticism, communicated with the best of intentions. There is no other way to learn!<br />Ideas and approaches are always judged on merit rather than source. We welcome discussions and challenges. This way everyone makes a tremendous impact no matter the role.<br /><br />REQUIREMENTS<br />You should apply if:<br /><br />You thrive on helping your team, colleagues and clients achieve their objectives.<br />You have excellent time management and organisational skills.<br />You're analytical and structured with a keen attention to detail.<br />You're an excellent written and verbal communicator with a knack for always finding the right tone.<br />Have a solid ability to develop effective written materials such as client documentation and process guidelines.<br />You're eligible to work in the UK. No visa sponsorship is available for this position.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />Salary of £30,000-£32,000 plus potential equity compensation upon fit.<br />Friendly, open and transparent culture.<br />You'll get to join a passionate startup with proven traction on its scaling journey.<br />Flexible working hours / ability to work from home.<br />Regular mentoring and feedback.<br />Awesome startup office in Central London, Fitzrovia.<br />25 days’ holiday plus all bank holidays.<br />Free coffee.<br />Regular socials, and team retreats to amazing destinations (Tbilisi, Sarajevo... Where next?)<br /><br />The process<br /><br />The interview process will involve:<br /><br />A review of your application;<br />A 15-minute chat where we both can learn more about each other;<br />Homework assignment for us to get a sense of how you tackle problems;<br />Two rounds of on-site technical and cultural chats with the team. If you are not currently based in London, we would be happy to speak with you over video chat;<br />Final round to iron out any remaining questions you may have.<br />This process should take around two weeks, depending on diaries.",

Poverty-Environment Action builds on the deep experience of the UNDPUN Environment Poverty-Environment Initiative (PEI). Over the past decade, PEI has pioneered integrated approaches to mainstreaming poverty-environment linkages in national development planning and implementation processesfirst in support of national efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and now as a model for implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p><p>By building on PEI’s legacy, PEA is uniquely placed to ensure that the environmental dimension is not left behind when addressing poverty. Leveraging broader 2030 Agenda and SDG implementation processes provides new entry points not only to mainstream environmental sustainability and related climate concerns for poverty eradication, but also to gradually shift government priorities and resource allocation towards addressing these issues. Further, it provides opportunities to improve the quality of private sector investments to support poverty-environment objectives. This represents the new focus of PEA aligning finance and investment with poverty, environment and climate objectives to accelerate SDG implementation.</p><p>PEA assists government decision-makers and a wide range of other stakeholders seeking to manage the environment in a way that improves livelihoods and leads to investments in sustainable growth that ensures economic growth and poverty reduction initiatives are not at the expense of the environment, with an overall aim to bring about lasting institutional change and to increase investment in pro-poor environmental and natural resource management.</p><p>UNDP serves as the Managing Agent for the PEA project administration under the guidance and supervision of the UNDP PEA Project Manager/Director of UNDP Global Policy Centre on Resilient Ecosystems and Desertification (GC-RED), PEA Project Management Specialist, and in collaboration with UNDP HQ BPPS/ROM, BMS (as needed) and GC-RED (Nairobi) operations staff. Special attention is given to the proper financial set-up of PEA particularly during the first year, to ensure the project is properly set-up and managed according to PEA’S multi-donor action agreement as well as UNDP’s rules and regulation. Part of the Poverty-Environment Initiative’s (PEA’s predecessor project) final evaluation recommendation was to set-up a financial management structure and procedures under PEA in a cost-efficient manner and to further train participating country project staff on the set-up and implementation of PEA activities at country level. In that regard, the Finance Consultant will be essential in not only successfully setting up PEA’s financial management structure, but to further provide guidance and train Country Office finance staff on the proper financial management of PEA funds, in particular when it comes to EU funds regulations.</p><p><strong>Supervision;</strong></p><p>The Finance Consultant will report to PEA’s Project Management Specialist.</p><p><strong>The application should contain;</strong></p><ul><li>Detailed Curriculum Vitae;</li><li>Proposal/ methodology for implementing the assignment ;</li><li>Financial proposal that indicates an all inclusive fee in USD.</li></ul><p>The successful applicant will be required to complete a UNDP Personal History Form (P11) form prior to contracting.</p><p><strong>Duties and Responsibilities</strong></p><p><strong>Purpose and Scope of Activity;</strong></p><p>The purpose of this assignment is to generate the essential quality business and financial operations analysis and information for UNDP to undertake necessary quality assurance as part of the Managing Agent function.</p><p>More precisely, the Finance Consultant is expected to complete the following tasks;</p><p><strong>Scope of Activity;</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure proper set-up and financial management of PEA;</li><li>Develop training materials, provide guidance and conduct training to PEA finance staff on the implementation of PEA funds;</li><li>Develop PEA financial management lessons learned.</li></ul><p><strong>Expected deliverables;</strong></p><ul><li>Generate, analyze and verify the project financial reporting inputs (Annual, Donor and Progress Project) and create best practices (69 days);</li><li>Develop training guidelines for PEA country finance teams on PEA financial implementation and conduct training on PEA financial management and use of funds according to donor agreements specific to PEA (15 days);</li><li>Generate, analyze and provide financial management updates and reports on financial project progress to senior management and donors to inform decision making (36 days);</li></ul><ul><li>Generate financial business processes mapping and lessons learned to ensure proper management of financial transactions (15 days);</li><li>Ensure financial closure of PEI outputs and document the process of transitioning from PEI to PEA as a means of lessons learned.

    "content": "<h2> Head of Marketing</h2><div>Marketing<br></div><div>4 Hours Overlap with Chicago Time<br></div><div>Remote First Company<br></div><div>Company: Basecamp<br></div><div>Full Time<br></div><h3>Overview</h3><p>For the past 20 years, we’ve been passive&nbsp;arketers with a little&nbsp;.</p><em>m</em><em>m</em><p>We speak at conferences and on podcasts, we write books (REWORK, REMOTE, It Doesn’t Have to be Crazy at Work), we share our point of view on thousands of blog posts, we invented a framework (Ruby on Rails) that changed an industry, and we make products that redefine their categories (Basecamp, Highrise, etc.). And right now we’re working on something new that’s going to surprise people.</p><p>We’ve gotten by on strength of product, cult of personality, a unique point of view, running against the wind, and incredibly generous word-of-mouth promotion from our customers. We’re fortunate it’s been working. 20 profitable years in business is the proof. We’re naturally proud of that.</p><p>But we feel like we’ve begun to saturate our natural sphere of influence, our current reach. Passive marketing can only get us so far, and we have a desire to go further. Today, if we’re in the mix, it’s by chance, not choice. And because of that, we feel a bit invisible outside of those who know us already.</p><p>And it’s no surprise: We haven’t really advertised. Or made it easy for new people to find us online. Lately we haven’t explained our brand particularly well. Or thought much about how we’re perceived in the modern market. We don’t show up in places where potential customers hang out, and we haven’t gone far enough supporting and sponsoring events and like-minded organizations. Basically, we’ve never deliberately focused on actively getting the word out, making sure our brand is positioned properly in the market, or meeting customers where they are.</p><p>We lack a Marketing strategy with a capital M. It’s time to change that.</p><p>Moving forward, we want to be intentional about creating awareness (how do we introduce Basecamp to people who don’t know us?), prompting consideration (how do we get people who need a product like ours to consider us for purchase?), and driving conversion (how do we get people who are considering Basecamp to sign up, pay us, and start using our products?).</p><p>So, for the first time, we’re ready to hire someone to lead that charge and own that responsibility. We’re looking for our first Head of Marketing.</p><p>How’s that challenge sound to you?</p><p></p><strong>ABOUT THE JOB AND THE WORK </strong><br><p>Fundamentally, this job is about developing and executing a broad strategy to bring more people to the front of the funnel by increasing awareness and interest outside of what we’ve already built. We’re not looking for somebody to spend time on email drip campaigns or improving onboarding. While important, this role is much broader than that. This also isn’t a job for self-described growth hackers.</p><p>This is a role for someone who knows how to mix a wild idea with a practical pitch. Someone who’s eager (but not annoyingly so) to pick up the phone and negotiate a major partnership deal. Someone who has an eye for talent, a nose for bullshit, ears close to the ground, and the creative mind of a conductor. Someone who’s previously managed large spends and helped a brand transition through a similar process. Someone who recognizes an opportunity when they see one, but knows how to steer clear of high effort low reward mirages. You see things other people miss, and you know how to put leverage to good use.</p><p>And while we’ll support your strategy with a multimillion dollar budget and creative support from the CEO, you’ll start this process without a dedicated internal team. While we have designers, writers, and a data analyst occasionally available to assist, we don’t have a marketing department or spare staff focused on everything you’ll need to get done. This means you’ll initially be expected to identify, vet, choose, and manage external vendors or agencies to help pull off your plan. Building an in-house team is something we’ll discuss down the road.</p><p>While some may see this as a disadvantage, we think it’s a big opportunity. You’ll be able to pull in the best agencies, freelancers, shops, and creative specialists to help pull off the plan. You’ll bring us creative ideas we’ve never considered in the past. You’ll challenge our thinking and help us see ourselves in a new light.</p><p>In addition to big picture strategy, you’ll focus on practical day-to-day work like fielding sponsorship opportunities that come our way. Keeping an eye on analytics. Reaching out to groups, organizations, movements, events, and other brands we should be partnering with. You’ll also be expected to regularly detail progress, setbacks, and marketing insights for the whole company.</p><p>We’re aware that at many companies, this is a multi-person position. Someone focused on the marketing strategy. Someone else focused on brand. Someone else focused on partnerships and sponsorships. And so on. We’re not expecting a herculean marketing turnaround with a single person at the start, but we absolutely believe the right person can point us in the right direction, guide us, come up with campaigns, be resourceful enough to get them produced, manage the process, study the results, course correct, revamp, and try more things. We know someone has to own this, or we’ll end up where we are today.</p><p>Bottom-line, this is an impact position. In time, the business should look better with you on board. A clear case of before and after. You’ll help us be noticed, be seen, and be found. We should also feel better about ourselves with you around. This is a big responsibility and we are here to support you, cheer you on, and make it happen. We’ve talked about having someone like you on board for years, and now we’re finally ready.</p><p></p><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong><p>You’ve done this before. You can’t wait to do it again. You absolutely want to do it for us.</p><p>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We’ll often subject ideas to rigorous debate, so you’ll need to stand up for what you believe, but we remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.</p><p>Yes, you’ll need to learn how we work at Basecamp, but we’re also looking for someone to teach us how to work. And once we’ve figured that out, be able to share that story with the world. We should tell the story of how we changed our approach to marketing.</p><p>We’re not looking for a superhero who thinks sheer hours = good work. Excess doesn’t impress us – creativity and efficiency does. You’ll have 8 hours a day to work, and, we hope, at least 8 hours a night to sleep. What you do with the other 8 is up to you, never to us. You’ll report directly to the CEO.</p><p></p><strong>ABOUT OUR PAY AND BENEFITS</strong><p>The salary for this position is $181,000. You can read about how we set salaries .</p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fm.signalvnoise.com%2Fbasecamp-doesnt-employ-anyone-in-san-francisco-but-now-we-pay-everyone-as-though-all-did%2F' rel='nofollow'>here</a><p>Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived away from work. None are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours, ample vacation time, summer hours, fitness, wellness, food, education, and charity.&nbsp;.</p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbasecamp%2Fhandbook%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fbenefits-and-perks.md' rel='nofollow'>See the full list</a><p>Basecamp is a remote-work company so you can be anywhere, but you’ll need at least 4 hours of overlap with Chicago time in your normal work-day routine.</p><p>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Basecamp is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.</p><p></p><strong>HOW TO APPLY</strong><p>Please send an application tailored to this position. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Show us that future.</p><p>We want to get a sense of how you think. To that end, please use your cover letter to share with us your take on the following questions:</p><ol></ol><li>Tell us how you’ve taken an existing brand to a new place by revamping their approach to marketing. How would you begin to approach figuring out where we stand and where we should be standing?</li><li>Give us an example of a small-to-medium sized business that you think markets themselves particularly well? Who’s doing an outstanding job out there? And why?</li><li>Since you’ll need to bring in outside talent to get the job done, which creative agencies or freelancers do you think are doing particularly interesting work? And why?</li><li>Share an example of a time great marketing caught your attention and turned you into a customer.</li><li>Tell us about something you almost bought recently, but decided not to. What failed to convince you?</li><li>What’s inspired you lately? What’s the most creative thing you’ve seen or experienced in the last few years?</li><p>We value great writers, so take your time with the application. Keep in mind that we do not equate length with substance, so please keep your cover letter to fewer than 1500 words. Stock cover letters won’t do – tell us why you want&nbsp;&nbsp;job, not just any job.</p><em>this</em><p></p><strong>Go for it! </strong><br><p>We are accepting applications for this position until June 28th, 2019. We’ll let you know that we’ve received your application. After that, you probably shouldn’t expect to hear back from us until after the application deadline has passed. We want to give everyone a fair chance to apply and be evaluated.</p><p>We can’t wait to hear from you!</p><div> <a href='https://basecamp.workable.com/j/3BEF6D97B2' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a></div>",

We are looking for an entrepreneurial, ethical and curious leader to run every aspect of our day-to-day business operations – financial management, human resources, planning and data systems, IT, and thousands of other things that will change daily. We are a global team of 16 people providing seed funding and mentorship to thousands of youth-led projects in over 130 countries. The ideal candidate must be excited about designing systems that help people connect and work better, problem-solving in a global context, using data to learn and improve, and building a truly stellar organization behind youth leaders. We are based in Boston but open to strong candidates anywhere.</p><p><strong>ABOUT PEACE FIRST:&nbsp;</strong>Peace First was founded on a simple idea: if we are going to solve the world’s greatest injustices, we must support this generation of young people with the skills and commitments to solve problems by connecting across lines of difference with compassion, standing up for ideals and others with courage, and creating collaborative change. This is what we call peacemaking. Currently, there are 1.6 billion young people, ages 13-25, around the world. They care deeply about what’s going on, they have boundless ideas on how to solve injustices and are ready to act yet seldom are they asked by adults what they think or, better yet, supported in bringing their ideas to life. Few have access to tools, mentors, and resources to turn their insights into reality. This is the divide we bridge. Peace First provides a blended digital design platform where young people can imagine and create powerful innovations to solve real problems in the world. In addition to digital design tools, we provide mentors, connections with young people from over 130 countries, and small start-up grants that start at $250 and scale up to $25,000 as youth scale their work. All of this takes place on the Peace First platform — the world’s largest marketplace for youth-led social change initiatives. In order for us to achieve our long-term goal of supporting a movement of 2.5 million engaged, compassionate, and creative youth, Peace First is launching a $10 million Global Youth Investment Fund to provide the financial spark to support efforts for social change. It will be the single largest investment in youth social action…ever. A key element of our strategic plan is to build out our team of talented professionals. We actively recruit, retain, and develop a multicultural and dynamic workforce that effectively and efficiently meets the wide spectrum of young people’s needs across the globe. We believe that an inclusive and open environment fosters creativity, contributes to the quality of our work, and provides growth opportunities for all employees.</p><p>To that end, we are seeking individuals who are excited about fostering this inclusive culture and working in an entrepreneurial environment where there is an immediate opportunity to have tangible impact on organizational direction and achievement. We are a team based around the world who thrive in an environment that embodies and celebrates the following:</p><ul><li>Possession of a deep belief in the ability of young people to create change</li><li>Ability to adapt and apply skills to new and changing scopes of work</li><li>Eagerness for more responsibility and exposure to new challenges</li><li>Motivation to solve problems by taking initiative and trying new ways of doing things</li><li>Enthusiasm for connecting others to our mission and providing them with powerful experiences</li><li>Openness to working with others across diverse perspectives and backgrounds</li></ul><p><strong>POSITION OVERVIEW:&nbsp;</strong>The Director of Operations and Finance works closely with the CEO to ensure internal systems and resources align with organizational strategies and goals. This position is responsible for managing all of the core business operations functions from financial planning, analysis, and reporting, to human resources, IT, contracts, and work flow planning.

    "content": "<h2> Head of Marketing </h2><div><div>For the past 20 years, we've been passive&nbsp;<em>m</em>arketers with a little&nbsp;<em>m</em>.</div><div><br></div><div><span>We speak at conferences and on podcasts, we write books (REWORK, REMOTE, It Doesn't Have to be Crazy at Work), we share our point of view on thousands of blog posts, we invented a framework (Ruby on Rails) that changed an industry, and we make products that redefine their categories (Basecamp, Highrise, etc.). And right now we're working on something new that's going to surprise people.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We've gotten by on strength of product, cult of personality, a unique point of view, running against the wind, and incredibly generous word-of-mouth promotion from our customers. We're fortunate it's been working. 20 profitable years in business is the proof. We're naturally proud of that.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>But we feel like we've begun to saturate our natural sphere of influence, our current reach. Passive marketing can only get us so far, and we have a desire to go further. Today, if we're in the mix, it's by chance, not choice. And because of that, we feel a bit invisible outside of those who know us already.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>And it's no surprise: We haven't really advertised. Or made it easy for new people to find us online. Lately we haven't explained our brand particularly well. Or thought much about how we're perceived in the modern market. We don't show up in places where potential customers hang out, and we haven't gone far enough supporting and sponsoring events and like-minded organizations. Basically, we've never deliberately focused on actively getting the word out, making sure our brand is positioned properly in the market, or meeting customers where they are.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We lack a Marketing strategy with a capital M. It's time to change that.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Moving forward, we want to be intentional about creating awareness (how do we introduce Basecamp to people who don't know us?), prompting consideration (how do we get people who need a product like ours to consider us for purchase?), and driving conversion (how do we get people who are considering Basecamp to sign up, pay us, and start using our products?).</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>So, for the first time, we're ready to hire someone to lead that charge and own that responsibility. We're looking for our first Head of Marketing.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>How's that challenge sound to you?</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>ABOUT THE JOB AND THE WORK</strong></div><div><span>Fundamentally, this job is about developing and executing a broad strategy to bring more people to the front of the funnel by increasing awareness and interest outside of what we've already built. We're not looking for somebody to spend time on email drip campaigns or improving onboarding. While important, this role is much broader than that. This also isn't a job for self-described growth hackers.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This is a role for someone who knows how to mix a wild idea with a practical pitch. Someone who's eager (but not annoyingly so) to pick up the phone and negotiate a major partnership deal. Someone who has an eye for talent, a nose for bullshit, ears close to the ground, and the creative mind of a conductor. Someone who's previously managed large spends and helped a brand transition through a similar process. Someone who recognizes an opportunity when they see one, but knows how to steer clear of high effort low reward mirages. You see things other people miss, and you know how to put leverage to good use.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>And while we'll support your strategy with a multimillion dollar budget and creative support from the CEO, you'll start this process without a dedicated internal team. While we have designers, writers, and a data analyst occasionally available to assist, we don't have a marketing department or spare staff focused on everything you'll need to get done. This means you'll initially be expected to identify, vet, choose, and manage external vendors or agencies to help pull off your plan. Building an in-house team is something we'll discuss down the road.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>While some may see this as a disadvantage, we think it's a big opportunity. You'll be able to pull in the best agencies, freelancers, shops, and creative specialists to help pull off the plan. You'll bring us creative ideas we've never considered in the past. You'll challenge our thinking and help us see ourselves in a new light.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>In addition to big picture strategy, you'll focus on practical day-to-day work like fielding sponsorship opportunities that come our way. Keeping an eye on analytics. Reaching out to groups, organizations, movements, events, and other brands we should be partnering with. You'll also be expected to regularly detail progress, setbacks, and marketing insights for the whole company.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We're aware that at many companies, this is a multi-person position. Someone focused on the marketing strategy. Someone else focused on brand. Someone else focused on partnerships and sponsorships. And so on. We're not expecting a herculean marketing turnaround with a single person at the start, but we absolutely believe the right person can point us in the right direction, guide us, come up with campaigns, be resourceful enough to get them produced, manage the process, study the results, course correct, revamp, and try more things. We know someone has to own this, or we'll end up where we are today.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Bottom-line, this is an impact position. In time, the business should look better with you on board. A clear case of before and after. You'll help us be noticed, be seen, and be found. We should also feel better about ourselves with you around. This is a big responsibility and we are here to support you, cheer you on, and make it happen. We've talked about having someone like you on board for years, and now we're finally ready.</span></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></div><div>You've done this before. You can't wait to do it again. You absolutely want to do it for us.</div><div><br></div><div>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We'll often subject ideas to rigorous debate, so you'll need to stand up for what you believe, but we remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, you’ll need to learn how we work at Basecamp, but we’re also looking for someone to teach us how to work. And once we’ve figured that out, be able to share that story with the world. We should tell the story of how we changed our approach to marketing.</div><div><br></div><div>We're not looking for a superhero who thinks sheer hours=good work. Excess doesn't impress us - creativity and efficiency does. You'll have 8 hours a day to work, and, we hope, at least 8 hours a night to sleep. What you do with the other 8 is up to you, never to us. You'll report directly to the CEO.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>ABOUT OUR PAY AND BENEFITS</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>The salary for this position is $181,000.

Introduce yourself as a colleague. Show us that future.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We want to get a sense of how you think. To that end, please use your cover letter to share with us your take on the following questions:</span></div><div><br></div><ol><li>Tell us how you've taken an existing brand to a new place by revamping their approach to marketing. How would you begin to approach figuring out where we stand and where we should be standing?</li><li>Give us an example of a small-to-medium sized business that you think markets themselves particularly well? Who's doing an outstanding job out there? And why?</li><li>Since you'll need to bring in outside talent to get the job done, which creative agencies or freelancers do you think are doing particularly interesting work? And why?</li><li>Share an example of a time great marketing caught your attention and turned you into a customer.</li><li>Tell us about something you almost bought recently, but decided not to. What failed to convince you?</li><li>What's inspired you lately? What's the most creative thing you've seen or experienced in the last few years?</li></ol><div><br></div><div>We value great writers, so take your time with the application. Keep in mind that we do not equate length with substance, so please keep your cover letter to fewer than 1500 words. Stock cover letters won't do - tell us why you want&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;job, not just any job.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Go for it!</strong></div><div><span>We are accepting applications for this position until June 28th, 2019.

    "content": "<p><em>Suit Human Resources, Recruitment, Talent Acquisition or Org Psych Background.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Arielle Executive is Australia's leading executive-level human marketing &amp; personal branding agency and we’re rapidly growing.<br><br>There is an exciting opportunity for a talented professional (with a background in Talent Acquisition, HR or Organisational Psychology) who is passionate about the power of the written word and its ability to sell, and who has knowledge of the recruitment and selection market, to join our small, nimble and highly capable team in the capacity of an Executive Brand Builder | Writer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHO ARE YOU?</strong></p><p>To succeed, you must GENUINELY be interested in people and leaders, delighting in their psychology and what makes them tick, marvelling at how they fit into what they do. This needs to be more than just a box-ticking job for you - you must have an innate desire to help shape and mould clients' unique histories to fit their next career goal. And a deep love affair with the English language is an absolute must.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHAT WILL YOU BE DOING?</strong></p><p>Your role will be to partner with our Consultants to execute the strategic brief for the client, as such positioning our clients as a unique answer to a clearly defined set of commercial challenges. Achieving this will require weaving together points of interest from the client's career to form a cohesive story, so that each of their career moves is strategically relevant and aligned to their intended direction. You will then use this narrative as a departure point for the creation of their resume, LinkedIn profile and other online assets, within which you'll articulate their value proposition. This suite of products then works as a congruent, multi-touch point, branded system to help them attract, and successfully compete for, top leadership roles.</p><p>You'll be drawing upon your well honed analytical and critical-thinking skills to tie together disparate layers of information by assessing it in the context of the bigger picture, in order to build the strongest business case possible for the client on their behalf. It’s imperative that you're the type of person who looks at problems from a variety of angles and that you have a broad understanding of business concepts. We take the responsibility we're given very seriously. We market people; their livelihoods depend on the work we do. As such, being highly tuned to commercial contexts and the needs of the person doing the recruiting, as well as the individual – i.e. being able to put yourself in all shoes – is vital.</p><p><br><strong>WHAT DOES IT TAKE?</strong></p><p>If you’re wired to build convincing arguments, and are often told that your talents have been wasted (i.e. you should have been a lawyer or a politician), this role will fit like a glove. You need to love the idea of sculpting and moulding your client’s experience to suit their direction, overlaying and aligning who they are and what they do with their goal in order to secure buy in from the reader.</p><p>Those who work best in our culture love to learn (i.e. not just say that they love to learn. The daily growth required within this role is challenging) and thrive in environments where they continuously push themselves to new heights. If you shriek at the sight of feedback – you will find our culture difficult. We all provide feedback to one another – and are happy to receive it too. We genuinely care about our clients so won’t be afraid to say that something can be improved upon. And we want you to be OK with that too, so accountability, integrity and resilience are paramount. You must be an avid believer in there always being a better way, and importantly, be willing to find it. Our products are always in a state of continuous evolution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?</strong></p><p>We love what we do. We’re a tightly knit and high performing team, and working with us you will do some of your best work. It is important to note however that being a part of remote team is a little different to being part of a team where you see your colleagues day in and day out. There are no water cooler conversations, no office Ping-Pong table (though there are plenty of other perks). Therefore, you MUST be fulfilled when you feel EMPOWERED to do your very BEST WORK. Our top talent have a deep passion for their craft, and LOVE to work remotely so that they can focus on the work itself – because this is something that they revel in.</p><p>For the right person, there will be an opportunity to progress to consulting, leading and driving brand discovery sessions with our executive clientele and advising on strategy regarding their positioning - both online and offline. This role will enable you to build a strong foundation. You'll learn the ropes, and understand what it is we do as well as how we do it, fusing marketing and branding with human resources and commercial acumen. Ample training and development will be provided to ensure that you succeed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p><ul><li><p>will only consider applicants with a HR, Talent Acquisition, Recruitment, Organisational Psychology, OR consulting experience;</p></li><li><p>you've always been an &quot;academic&quot;, and proud of your ability to analyse and write about your subject; you will have an 2:1 or above in English Literature, Psychology or Arts based Degree;</p></li><li><p>you can write using incredibly polished, intelligent &quot;business&quot; language. Experience in writing business cases, proposals, and/or thought leadership articles is desirable;</p></li><li><p>you're a natural storyteller; with the power to connect disparate pieces of information to create compelling narratives;</p></li><li><p>you understand transferable people competencies, skills and abilities, and can align experience/personal fit for specific jobs;</p></li><li><p>you're someone who can always &quot;spin&quot; an argument, and a passion for building cases that influence and convince;</p></li><li><p>a broad understanding of business concepts and a capacity to comprehend the challenges international executives face is essential – do you read HBR?</p></li><li><p>Time management and discipline– if you’re always running out of time, please don’t apply. You must be able to commit to 2 business day turnarounds – non negotiable;</p></li><li><p>a knack for research - able to pick out key concepts from a lot of information.</p></li></ul>",

We publish a quarterly print magazine about specialty coffee culture catering to professionals and enthusiasts all over the world. Our magazine is our product, and the job is to ensure that it is enjoyed by as many readers as possible.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a role for someone who has run the marketing operations for a company with revenue at least €1mil and with a dedicated marketing strategy. At Standart, you’ll be running all our marketing campaigns and communications, and will report to the CEO. As the Head of Marketing, you’ll be responsible for the overall growth of the company.</div><div><br></div><div>Standart is a fully remote company. We have no central office, and no set business hours. Our team currently work in four different timezones, from the UK to Japan. You can work from wherever you like, but will need ensure at least 4 hours a week of overlap with Central European Time for team calls. This means someone who thrives on autonomy, and reacts to it with a high level of accountability. We need you to define your work habits, deliverables, schedule, and then follow through. We’re not interested in how many hours you work—we’re interested in the quality of that work.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re a small team, but we’re also a very close team, and trust and openness is important to us. Everyone on the team has an important role to play, and everyone has an impact.</div><div><br></div><div>Standart seeks to provide a work setting that allows you the support and encouragement you need to do your best work, and we encourage candidates from all backgrounds to apply.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>About the job</h3></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>The most important job for the head of marketing is to drive sales and revenue. We can create the most beautifully curated magazine in the world, but if we don’t sell it, no one will get to enjoy it.</div><div><br></div><div>This means the role requires someone who is enthusiastic about our company and our work and making sure as many people as possible get to enjoy it. At the end of the day, that is the goal. You’ll help strategise and implement a successful marketing framework to move us forward.</div><div><br></div><div>Marketing is not just about designing the best campaign. This role also requires the implementation of strategy and tactics and management on a daily basis, over a number of projects and day-to-day tasks. We’re looking for a T-shaped marketer who can have an immediate impact that achieves rapid measurable outcomes and long-term growth.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>What you might be working on:</h4></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Sales</strong></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>Increasing yearly revenue across subscriptions, wholesale accounts, and advertising.</span><br></li><li><span>Improving customer retention rates.</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Branding and strategy</strong><br></div><div></div><div><strong></strong></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>Developing and implementing a three-year marketing strategy and outlining metrics to measure success.</span><br></li><li><span>Developing and implementing branding guidelines for all our customer-facing communications.</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Management</strong></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>Completing performance and forecast reports.</span><br></li><li><span>Overseeing implementation of strategy and guidelines across all markets.</span><br></li><li><span>Design and roll out marketing training to team members and new hires.</span></li></ul><div><br></div><div>Your work will be a combination of smaller, recurring tasks, and longer-term, project-based tasks. Smaller tasks are often detailed and repeat on a regular basis; we expect you to develop efficient workflows to complete them, allowing you to balance day-to-day with project work. You will develop metrics, set targets, and instil a culture that values success.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s not just doing the work, but doing work that lasts.</div><div><br></div><div>The role carries a lot of responsibility. We have one core product, and the company’s existence depends on effectively marketing that product. You need to understand this responsibility, but approach your work systematically and calmly, with an eye to the future. Don’t stress the small stuff; it’s the long game that matters.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>About You</h3></div><div><br></div><div>We are a small team with varied responsibilities that feed into each other. At Standart, we all work to the same goal. We are looking for someone who has an optimistic and positive attitude, and avoids blaming and shaming.</div><div><br></div><div>You need to own the concept of being responsible for communicating our product. Unless you tell us otherwise, we will assume that you have what you need to get the job done. You need to be someone who thrives on autonomy and responds with a high degree of accountability.</div><div><br></div><div>You will have to learn how we work and adapt, but we also want to be shown new ways to work. Even though you will be ultimately responsible for our marketing efforts, there may be times when another course or route will need to be taken to achieve an outcome. We expect that you can commit to doing your best work even when things are less than perfect.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re not looking for someone who does their best work in a crisis situation, but someone who—through planning and routine—can avoid those crises and get the job done within a healthy number of work hours.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>Pay and benefits</h3></div><div><br></div><div>Standart is an EU company legally based in Slovakia. Based on a contract, we pay a progressive salary that will start within the range of €42k to €50k per year, depending on your experience and qualifications, and increasing to as high as €105k in increments corresponding to achieved milestones.</div><div><br></div><div>We understand that in order to do your best work, you need to be in good health, both physical and mental. We believe in providing ample time off, flexible working hours, and time for creativity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Standart offers 4 weeks of paid holiday per year. We don’t track your days off, but the team needs to know if you’re planning on not being available, so just let us know.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We offer other perks and benefits such as supporting you in continuous learning to expand your knowledge and inspiration, yearly team get-togethers in different cities around the world, equipment, quality reading, and excellent coffee.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>How to apply</h3></div><div><br></div><div>We are accepting applications for this position until June 21. We will let you know when we’ve received it, and will get back to you once we have had time to make an evaluation.</div><div><br></div><div>Please send us a CV and a cover letter introducing yourself which will give us a taste of what working with you will be like. About 800 words should do it. Be sure to let us know why you chose us, why we should choose you, and a little about how you would approach some of the example projects detailed above. As a print publication and fully-remote company, we value great writing and effective communication. Show us what you’ve got!</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking forward to working together.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more Sales &amp; Marketing jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Interview Schedule</span><br><span>Account Executive</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>USA</span></a></li><li><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Olark</span><br><span>Partner Channel Marketing Manager</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>United States or Canada</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

Our suite of applications is served from a mix of our own servers in leased data-center space and cloud setups in Google Cloud and AWS. The job is to ensure that everything runs smoothly, the lights stay on, and we’ve prepared for bad luck with good planning.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a role for someone with experience running a team at least as big as ours and a multi-million dollar budget. You’ll be managing a team of seven and report to the CTO.</div><div><br></div><div>Basecamp is a remote-work company, but you’ll need at least 4 hours of overlap with Chicago time in your normal work-day routine.</div><div><br></div><div>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Basecamp is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>ABOUT THE JOB<br></strong></div><div>The most important job for operations at Basecamp is to keep the lights on. If our applications aren’t available, it doesn’t matter how well we’ve designed them, how clever we are at marketing them, or how good our support team is. Nobody wants to buy flaky.</div><div><br></div><div>This means thinking carefully about risk, making (and testing!) contingency plans, and expecting the worst. While this invariably invites a certain degree of conservatism, part of the job is also being open to what comes next. We used to run everything on our own machines, now we’re also in the cloud. You will help us weigh the trade-offs and mitigate the risks, while moving us forward.</div><div><br></div><div>While ops is the second biggest team at Basecamp (after customer support), it’s not so big you won’t have to get your hands dirty. This is a technical role as much as a managerial one. And we expect that you have a broad range of technical chops. Enough such that participating in an on-call rotation does not frighten you (because you will be part of it!). To manage the work at Basecamp, you need to know the work and do the work.</div><div><br></div><div>Here are some examples of what you might be working on:</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>Prepare for the future</strong></div><ol><li>Propose a strategy for how we best serve our large, unsharded databases for Basecamp in the cloud. This could include benchmarking instances, working with consultants like Percona, and validating assumptions with the cloud provider.</li><li>Coordinate a cloud storage migration to move a couple of petabytes of data from Google to Amazon. Clarify how we verify that everything has been copied, how we may move back, and validating the resilience design. Work with our Security, Infrastructure &amp; Performance team to have programming changes made to the application logic.</li></ol><div><strong></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><b>Mitigate downtime</b><br></div><div></div><ol><li>Prepare a schedule of regular fire drills for fail-overs between cloud storage regions or applications on our multi-data center setup.</li><li>Wake up at 4am to act as incident lead on an outage, then write up the incident report and remediation analysis. Also, considering what lessons need to be incorporated into our crisis handbook.</li><li>Be available during evenings and weekends for occasional preventative maintenance.</li></ol><div><strong></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><b>Team management</b><br></div><div></div><ol><li>Conduct a 1:1 with an ops team member, discussing long-term career progression and short-term goals.</li><li>Run a weekly team call and to discuss upcoming and ongoing work.&nbsp;</li><li>Write a detailed heartbeat explaining the progress within ops over the last six weeks and a detailed kickoff explaining what’s coming up in the next six.</li></ol><div><br></div><div>A lot of the work on ops is reactive: dealing with an outage, setting up a new application, addressing a security vulnerability. And you’ll have a great team of veterans capable of dealing with much of that. Your job in addition to dealing with the day-to-day is to deal with what comes next.</div><div><br></div><div>We'll be looking to you to clearly define the roles within the ops team, build clear lines of accountability, set targets for our systems (should we be chasing 5 9s?), balance the reactive work with project work, and ultimately instill a resilience culture at Basecamp. It's not just managing the work, it's also bringing the vision of what the work should be.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a lot of responsibility and a high degree of criticality. Basecamp’s existence quite literally depends on the ops team’s ability to keep the servers running and the services available. But that’s only all the more reason that you know how to do this work while keeping and working calmly.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>ABOUT YOU<br></strong></div><div>Basecamp is a company of&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fm.signalvnoise.com%2Fmoonlighting-managers-aint-got-no-time-for-bullshit%2F' rel='nofollow'>moonlighting managers</a>. While you’ll be responsible for a sizable team, we’re not looking for a micromanager or a chief whip. Everyone at Basecamp is here to do the best work of their career, so we work on systemic problems and try to avoid individual blame.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for a clear systems thinker. Someone who reads a story about the intern dropping the production database and wonders not “what an idiot” but “how was this possible in the first place?”.</div><div><br></div><div>At the same time, you must be willing to own the concept of keeping the lights on. Unless you’re specifically raising the alarm to signal otherwise, we’ll expect that you have what you need and is able to do what needs to be done. Someone who thrives on a high level of autonomy and responds with a high level of accountability.</div><div><br></div><div>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous debate, but we remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes, you'll need to learn how we work at Basecamp, but we're also looking for someone to teach us how to work. And once we've figured that out, be able to share that story with the world. There's no reason Ops at Basecamp can't have a public profile like we do with programming or design. You'll help us build one.</div><div><br></div><div>What we're not looking for is a superhero who might be able to put out five fires burning at once by working 80+ hours/week, but a candidate who avoids the drama by following sound building codes, performing regular inspections, and responding to incidents with a tight routine.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>ABOUT OUR PAY AND BENEFITS<br></strong></div><div>Our pay is within the top 10% of the industry, for the matched role and experience, based on San Francisco rates. This comes to a range at hiring of between $280,000 and $350,000, depending on your seniority and qualifications. No matter where you live.</div><div><br></div><div>Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived away from work. None are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite. We’re all about reasonable working hours, amble vacation time, summer hours, fitness, wellness, food, education, and charity.&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbasecamp%2Fhandbook%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fbenefits-and-perks.md' rel='nofollow'>See the full list</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>HOW TO APPLY<br></strong></div><div>Please send an application tailored to this position that speaks to us. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Show us that future. We value great writers, so take your time with the application. There’s no prize for being the first to submit!</div><div><br></div><div>We’d like to hear about how you’d approach some of the example projects outlined in the description about the job. Imagine you’re doing the work and walk us through your thinking.</div><div><br></div><div>All that being said, don’t send in a copy of War &amp; Peace. We hire rarely at Basecamp, so when we do, there’s usually many applicants. Be kind to the people doing application triage and keep your cover letter to fewer than 800 words and the thoughts on project approaches below the same ceiling (for a total of 1600 words max).<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Go for it!<br></div><div></div><div></div><div>We are accepting applications for this position until&nbsp;<strong>June 7th, 2019</strong>. We’ll let you know that we’ve received your application. After that, you probably shouldn’t expect to hear back from us until after the application deadline has passed. We want to give everyone a fair chance to apply and be evaluated.</div><div><br></div><div>We can’t wait to hear from you!</div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more DevOps &amp; Sysadmin jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><span>New <i></i></span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>TeamSnap</span><br><span>DevOps Engineer (Site Reliability Engineer)</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>USA</span></a></li><li><span>New <i></i></span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Theorem</span><br><span>Senior DevOps Engineer @ Google</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>North America, Western US</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

We currently have a list of around 2000 companies with some information about each of them. This information includes: website, company name, LinkedIn company profile, and the city and country the headquarters are in. We also have the name of the founder and the contact details for these companies.</p><p>The directory could possibly use an existing WordPress plugin. Here is an example of a similar type of directory: <a href='https://saasmag.com/2019-list/' rel='nofollow'>https://saasmag.com/2019-list/</a>.</p><p><strong>The directory will need the following features:</strong></p><ol><li>The ability for us to add all of the companies we already have.</li><li>The ability for a company to add themselves.</li><li>The ability for companies to log in.</li><li>The ability to email companies a link which will allow them to log in and update their directory listing.</li><li>A MailChimp signup form embedded on the page.</li><li>The ability to search the list for a particular company.</li><li>An admin site to edit entries.</li><li>The ability to add lists of new companies in the admin site.</li><li>A list of all of the companies.</li></ol><p><strong>The following fields are to be included on the company profile page:</strong></p><ul><li>Company Name</li><li>Company Description</li><li>Country</li><li>Number of Employees</li><li>Name of the CEO/Founder</li><li>Position</li><li>Website Link</li><li>LinkedIn Company Profile Link</li></ul><p><strong>TO BE THE BEST MATCH FOR THIS JOB, YOU MUST HAVE EXCELLENT SKILLS IN:</strong></p><ul><li>WordPress development (If you will not be using WordPress then PHP is preferred.)</li><li>Design</li><li>Project management</li></ul><p><strong>We expect this job to be completed in the following stages:</strong></p><p>Stage 1: Decide what technology to use. (For example, which WordPress plugin). Create the directory design. Receive our approval for the design.</p><p>Stage 2: Create the directory backend and upload it to our servers.</p><p>Stage 3: Upload all of the existing companies to the directory. Create a spreadsheet with a list of all the companies and the link/instructions of how they can update their listings. In this stage, we will do some additional quality assurance for the site to make sure it is working properly.</p><p><strong>Additional Points:</strong></p><ol><li>The design must look amazing.</li><li>If we are not happy with Stage 1, we will not continue on to Stage 2.</li><li>We expect Stage 1 to be very low cost.

We’d love to talk to you about managing&nbsp;</span><span>enterprise web&nbsp;</span><span>projects for Lullabot</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Projects of this magnitude require a competent hand on the tiller—someone technical enough to understand the intricacies of large-scale Drupal web projects, but also someone that can see the big picture, translating business goals into requirements, specs into estimates and tickets, and talented individuals into teams. With that in mind, Lullabot is hiring an experienced technical project manager.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span>Responsibilities include: writing requirements as specifications, user stories, or tickets; and managing scope, deliverables, schedules, and team resources for Lullabot client and internal projects. Daily tasks include leading 15-minute check-in calls for each project, scheduling and leading periodic sprint reviews and planning meetings, tending the ticket queue and managing task lists, communicating&nbsp;</span><span>(email/phone)&nbsp;</span><span>with clients, performing rigorous testing and verification, and keeping projects on track and moving forward. In addition, we believe a great project manager should have experience doing the work that they’re managing. Experience as a front-end or Drupal developer is a huge plus. &nbsp;Lullabot is a distributed company without a central office, so like all Lullabot jobs, this is a telecommuting position that occasionally involves travel.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span>Additional responsibilities include helping to write and assemble new project proposals and statements of work, estimating and staffing projects, meeting with clients, pursuing and growing development partnerships, and coordinating project launches.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span>If this sounds like a lot, it is. But Lullabot is a very collaborative company so you won’t be working in isolation. You’ll be working with a team of highly experienced Drupal consultants and developers with excellent communication skills and a passion for their work.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span>Please note: if you’re a Drupal developer who’s shown a strong talent for organizing teams, gets irritated when the ticket backlog isn’t complete and well-organized, or who finds themselves frequently in the primary communication role and is not afraid of spreadsheets or Gannt charts, please consider applying. We’ve found that some of the most successful PMs are those people who thoroughly understand and have done the work involved.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span><span><strong>Ideal candidates should:</strong></span></span></div><ul><li><span>Have 2 years or more experience managing or participating on large-scale Drupal projects.</span></li><li><span>Have experience managing projects in ticketing systems such as Github,&nbsp;</span><span>Notion, or&nbsp;</span><span>JIRA.</span></li><li><span>Understand code promotion workflows, version control, and development best practices.</span></li><li><span>Be a great communicator with good writing skills.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable managing and organizing remote virtual teams.</span></li><li><span>To&nbsp;</span><span>align&nbsp;</span><span>best with our client’s&nbsp;</span><span>time zones and allow for easy travel within the US</span><span>, we are currently looking for someone who lives&nbsp;</span><span>in the Continental US</span><span>.</span></li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span><span><strong>Other Requirements</strong></span></span></div><div><span>The successful applicant must:&nbsp;</span></div><ul><li><span>be located&nbsp;</span><span>in the continental U</span><span>.</span><span>S</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>and authorized to work full-time,</span></li><li><span>have in-depth experience&nbsp;</span><span>&gt; than 2 years in the field,</span></li><li><span>possess a&nbsp;</span><span>b</span><span>achelor’s degree in computer science and/or a degree in information technology management and/or a master’s degree in business administration, and/or PMP, and/or similar&nbsp;</span><span>preferred</span><span>; but we’re open to strong candidates with a liberal arts degree and a proven track record,</span></li><li><span>and&nbsp;</span><span>be&nbsp;</span><span>comfortable with a starting salary between&nbsp;</span><span>$85,000 - $97,500, pay will be commensurate with experience.</span></li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span><strong>Availability:&nbsp;</strong></span><span>We’re looking for a full-time candidate who can start within two weeks of being offered the job.</span><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span><span><strong>About Lullabot:</strong></span></span></div><div><span>Chances are good that working for Lullabot will be like nothing you’ve ever done before. Lullabot has been a leader in Drupal web development since our founding in 2006. We’re a distributed company without a central office, and our team is spread out across the U.S., Canada, and Europe.&nbsp;</span><span><strong>However, for this particular role we are only looking for US</strong></span><span><strong>-</strong></span><span><strong>based applicants.&nbsp;</strong></span><span>We are masters of communication and our tightly-knit team works very closely despite geographical separation. In fact, most new employees say they feel more connected to their co-workers at Lullabot than they ever did at a conventional co-located company.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span>Lullabot is distributed, but not a</span><span>“virtual”</span><span>company. The majority of our workers are full-time employees and we provide a great&nbsp;</span><span><a href='https://www.lullabot.com/jobs/benefits' rel='nofollow'>benefits package</a> </span><span>including health, vision, dental, and life insurance; a retirement plan; a generous tech stipend for employees to purchase computers, cell phones, or other work-related expenses; and a stock options package once you reach your two-year anniversary. We offer new employees 15 paid-days-off per year, 20 paid-days-off per year after your two-year anniversary, &nbsp;and 25 paid-days-off after your seven-year anniversary. In addition, we offer a four-week paid Sabbatical once an employee hits 10 years with Lullabot.&nbsp;</span><span>(Plus&nbsp;</span><span>holidays!) And did we mention there’s no commute? Your time is flexible as well, so if you need to take a break to pick the kids up from school, it’s usually not a problem.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span>We have flexible hours, but we tend to schedule meetings during the North American workday and expect employees to be online and available during most of this time. While we work a 40-hour week, we schedule our developers 30 billable hours per week to leave time for learning, article writing, internal projects, or work in the community. Self-direction, a casual but confident attitude, and a focus on quality over quantity are some of the things we look for. We work from both the head and the heart and guide our decisions by our&nbsp;</span><span><a href='https://www.lullabot.com/values' rel='nofollow'>Core Values</a></span><span>.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span><span><strong>One more thing…</strong></span></span></div><div><span>We strive to be transparent about our timeline and welcome you to reach out to <a href='mailto:hr@lullabot.com' rel='nofollow'>hr@lullabot.com</a> and touch base on your application at any time.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span><em>Lullabot, Inc. is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate against applicants or employees because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, or membership in any other class protected by law.

You like to lead and you thrive when you have to rally the team to achieve a common objective.</p><p>If that sounds like you, and you’re either experienced as an executive assistant or an operations person in a fast moving environment or you understand book publishing (super bonus points for both!), you just might be our dream candidate for this position.</p><p><strong>What is your role?</strong></p><p>Support our team as we fulfill each client’s dream of writing, publishing and selling a book they are proud to hand to anyone.</p><p>Book Launchers helps entrepreneurs and professionals publish high quality non-fiction books. But, this is not a traditional publishing company. Our authors retain all control and ownership over the content and keep all royalties. We provide the team and the guidance to help our authors not only write and publish, but also to achieve their business objectives through their book. It’s not just about selling books (although we help guide them through how to sell books too!). It’s about using a book to build a business, boost a brand, become a recognized expert all while sharing valuable expertise and experience with others.</p><p>As a direct report to the President of the company, you will have your pulse on everything that is happening and be responsible for ensuring the entire team knows what to do, when to do it, and has the resources they need to execute. You will live by our mantra of #noboringbooks and assist the team in creating client success on each book. You’ll be the driving power and enthusiasm behind our mission to be the choice for book publishing, not the alternative.</p><p>In this role, you are responsible for the operational vision of our organization including the implementation of our communications cadence, team meetings, and our process management. You’ll also provide support to the President and Client Care Manager in communicating with potential author clients and active clients about process related subjects.</p><p>As the main point person for each contractor, it’s your role to manage each book project’s timelines, flag potential issues before they are problems, and be ready to jump in wherever you’re needed in client support.</p><p><strong>Our process has five phases:</strong></p><ul><li>Pen to Paper (Writing Your Book)</li><li>Process (Editing)</li><li>Publishing (Design, Layout, &amp; Set Up with Printing and Distribution)</li><li>Platform (Building the business around the book including website, social media,and other services offered around the book)</li><li>Promote (Selling the book).</li></ul><p>You’ll make sure the right people are working on their manuscript at the right time, and that each success is celebrated! And, you’ll make sure the entire Book Launchers team is on target. Think of yourself as one part cheerleader and one part director.</p><p>If people and processes are fun for you this is your kind of gig!</p><p><strong>Specific Tasks Include:</strong></p><ol><li>Schedule, oversee, and run all targeted interactions for the team, including the weekly, monthly, quarterly and annual meetings.</li><li>Recruiting and retention assist with recruiting game-changing team members, be the initial screening before skill tests and interviews takes place. Put in place operational systems that ensure they stay with us for the long term.</li><li>Set up, send, and manage all contractors contractual agreements and ensure all details are recorded, deadlines are recorded, managed and adhered to. When projects are complete ensuring the processes are followed for hand off, uploading, and delivery.</li><li>People and Process Leadership apply and keep up to date company process systems throughout our organization so every person knows what their outcomes are, what they are accountable for and what their scoreboard is (outcome, accountability, and transparency).</li><li>Client Care Project Support Ensure every client understands their book project timeline, is comfortable about what happens at each step when it’s about to happen. Respond to basic client questions on a daily basis and funnel other questions to Client Care Manager.</li><li>Drive and manage the tactical delivery of ongoing projects in the company deliverables for all company initiatives and report back to President and team.</li><li>Support the President in managing the sales leads, executing her vision and growing the business.</li><li>Providing support to the President for the maintenance and implementations of all HR policies, processes, and documentation.</li></ol><p>You will enjoy a lot of freedom to create and control your day in this job, but please don’t think this job will be easy. We are a very lean team managing a growing roster of book projects in progress and in promotion. And, you’ll be in front of it all. There will be some pretty intense days. But, we promise the job will never be boring, we as a company always have your back, and working alongside the founder and President, you’ll have a tremendous opportunity to grow with the company if you rock this role.</p><p>If this sounds like a perfect fit for you then you’re obviously someone special so we want to tell you why we’re worthy of your greatness.</p><p><strong>Here’s the deal:</strong></p><p><strong>While most of the key members of the Book Launchers team are based in and around Los Angeles, the team works remotely.</strong>&nbsp;Why battle traffic if you don’t have it?</p><p>What unites us is a passion for quality and our clients success. Book Launchers founder Julie Broad started the company with author’s success in mind. She is a Top 20 under 40 award winning entrepreneur, an award winning Amazon Overall #1 bestselling author (her first self-published niche non-fiction book actually topped the charts of all the millions of books sold in Canada on Amazon for 36 hours and was in the Top 100 print books sold for 45 days!), and she’s a recognized expert on self-publishing, branding and marketing (Book Launchers YouTube channel has more than 10,000 subscribers and is definitely worth watching to get a feel for the company).</p><p>Most importantly, we’re growing and learning everyday so working here is a fun adventure.</p><p><strong>This position would start part time but can quickly move to full-time if that is desired. Salary range for part time (20-25 hours/week) is $22,500 $30,000 per year, depending on your experience with book publishing or operational excellence.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://booklaunchers.com/join-our-team/exec-assistant/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Reporting directly to our VP of Growth, you’ll be responsible for helping to expand Aptible’s marketing presence through optimized strategy and cutting-edge tools.</p><p><strong>About Aptible</strong></p><p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p><p>Our mission is to build trust on the internet. We do this by empowering innovative teams to build strong data protection programs and become trustworthy custodians of sensitive data.</p><p><strong>What We Believe</strong></p><p>We believe building trust is essential to unleashing the internet’s transformative potential: A global internet based on strong trust can build communities, reshape economies, and improve the lives of billions around the world. We are starting with security and privacy. Data, such as personal data, is increasingly sensitive and risky to handle. We believe the best way to build trust is to build teams that are inherently trustworthy.</p><p><strong>Imagine:</strong></p><p>What if data breaches on the internet weren’t common?</p><p>What if every team knew how good they were at security before a breach?</p><p>What if every team knew how much time, money, and people they should invest in security?</p><p>What if every engineering team had access to great DevOps security?</p><p><strong>How We Prioritize</strong></p><p><strong>Customer Empowerment Over Customer Happiness</strong></p><p>We think of customer success in terms of empowerment and growth through self-improvement, which makes it easy to have a deep passion for that success and be deeply invested in it. We want to see our customers grow into mature teams that excel at protecting data. That said, the customer is not always right. Sometimes we tell customers things they don’t want to hear, to help them improve. We think and talk about empowerment across the entire team, not just product: In our marketing, we’re more likely to give away knowledge than swag. In sales, we always try to answer substantive questions and provide a roadmap for prospects, even if they don’t buy.</p><p><strong>Experience and Opinion Over Flexibility</strong></p><p>Empowerment and growth as self-improvement also deeply inform our design for customer experiences, like product and support. We help our customers by solving hard problems in multiple domains. Our customers look to us as guides, and we weave our deep legal and technical experience into our software and services. Our products teach you how to get better as you use them: to do this well, we often choose to sacrifice flexibility first.</p><p><strong>Leverage Over Effort</strong></p><p>Our customers value leverage: doing more with less time and money, and fewer people. Our products give them leverage by making complex processes simple and safe. With Gridiron, our customers can launch an enterprise-grade compliance program without a CISO or security department. With Enclave, our customers get the benefits of a secure, highly-available, fault-tolerant infrastructure without having to recruit, run, and retain a DevOps team. We build products and experiences that give customers more value as they invest more into them.</p><p>As a team, we praise focus and seek leverage as we plan our work. Individually, we plan our work to make the biggest impact with the least amount of precious time. Sleep is leverage: We believe in getting enough of it. Good health is leverage: We take pride in our physical and mental health benefits. It will take years to reach our most ambitious goals, so we aim to perform at a high level over a long period of time.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p><p><strong>Your First 3 Months</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll work with our Product Marketing Team to define our acquisition strategy. Starting with a deep understanding of our customers and prospects, you’ll define a strategy that educates our prospects, is compatible with our brand, and yields qualified opportunities.</li><li>You’ll work with our Sales Team to lead the creation, implementation, and testing of educational engagement and nurture omnichannel sequences for our inbound and outbound leads, demonstrating improvement in conversion to opportunity.</li><li>You’ll work with our Product Marketing Team to own our advertising strategy, including: SEM, ABM, Retargeting, and Social.</li><li>You’ll work with our Product Marketing Team to manage our marketing automation platform and related tools.

Whether we’re helping developers get answers to their questions or find new jobs, we build products that make millions of developers’ lives better every day. Our goal is to create a community and a company where every developer feels welcome to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. We’re not there yet, which is why we’re hoping you can join us and help!</p><p>As an Engineering Manager, you’ll support a team of developers as an active servant leader. You’ll make sure that the members of your team have the skills, direction, and information they need to build great products, and you’ll work to build a diverse team and inclusive culture that brings out the best in everyone.</p><p>We’re a remote-first team.&nbsp;<strong>Whether you work remotely or work out of our New York office, you’ll be part of a remote work culture</strong>&nbsp;that emphasizes online communication (Trello, Slack, GitHub, Hangouts). While we’re generally very flexible on working hours, for this position you’ll need to have a wide coverage from Europe to West Coast US, so you’ll be expected to work roughly New York time zone hours.</p><p><strong>What we’re looking for:</strong></p><ul><li>Gets-Things-Done Dev Background: You have a solid full-stack web development background (5+ years). It may be a few years since you’ve been a dev, but you still have a pragmatic attitude to technology and know how to take on complex projects and get them done.</li><li>Manager and Coach: You’re an experienced manager (3+ years) who loves helping other people get better at their job. You have a knack for helping people see their problem in a new light and guiding them to a solution, and you make an excellent rubber ducky.</li><li>Cross-Team Facilitator: You like working with other teams and figuring out how to get things running more smoothly. You dive into communication problems and conflict, and you know when to create and modify existing process and practice to move things forward. You’re fluent in translating developer-to-business speak (and back), and comfortable working across a wide variety of teams, from Product Managers to Design, Site Reliability, Marketing, Sales, and more.</li><li>Collaborative and Inclusive: You have a track record of creating an inclusive and collaborative engineering culture. You help build understanding and empathy within your team, and actively work to bring people into the conversation and understand their viewpoint.</li><li>Experience managing Advertising and Technology is a plus</li></ul><p><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Remotely manage a team of 8-10 developers&nbsp;</strong>ranging from junior to very senior. Continuously develop your team through coaching and feedback, and recruit new team members as needed.</li><li>Collaborate with product management and design on roadmaps and make sure the right devs are lined up for the right projects. Proactively identify and remove roadblocks.</li><li>Review technical specs and implementation with your team, and help the team set a high bar for code quality. Work with PMs to make sure technical debt is prioritized and planned for.</li><li>Create and refine internal processes that help people communicate and collaborate more effectively, and increase quality and velocity over time.</li></ul><p><strong>What we value:</strong></p><ul><li>Servant Leadership: The best managers lead by empowering and inspiring their team to do their best work.</li><li>Collaboration: The best products are created when people from different backgrounds and disciplines work closely together in an environment of respect and trust.</li><li>Transparency: Trust is built on openness and transparency. If there is not a good reason to keep it a secret, we share it. For example, we share our complete engineering salary formula.</li><li>Inclusion: We do our best work when we can be our whole selves at work. We’re committed to policies and benefits that support people, and managers who foster an open and inclusive culture.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus:</strong>&nbsp;If you have experience managing the advertising technology area</p><p><strong>When you apply…&nbsp;</strong>Please include an up-to-date resume, and a cover letter explaining why you’re interested in working at Stack Overflow.</p><p><strong>What you’ll get in return:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Ability to work remotely, with flexible hours</strong></li><li>20 days paid vacation + holidays</li><li>Completely free health insurance – no copay, no premiums (US residents)</li><li>Generous parental leave (10-16 weeks at 100% pay), family care leave, and unlimited sick days</li><li>Employees will never be poked with a sharp stick</li></ul><p><strong>If you want to work remotely.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>We’ll help you set up a great home office, with an ergonomic chair, standing desk, and any other equipment you need to do your job.</strong></p><p><strong>If you want to work in our office&nbsp;</strong>You’ll get your own private office in our headquarters in New York City, and enjoy additional benefits like free lunch every day prepared by our own in-house chefs, transportation reimbursement, and all the espresso you can drink.</p><p><strong>About Stack Overflow<br>Stack Overflow</strong>&nbsp;is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. More than 50 million professional and aspiring programmers visit Stack Overflow each month to help solve coding problems, develop new skills, and find job opportunities.</p><p>We partner with businesses to help them understand, hire, engage, and enable the world’s developers. Our products and services are focused on developer marketing, technical recruiting, market research, and enterprise knowledge sharing.</p><p>We believe in hiring smart people and getting out of their way. We have an office in New York with some of the best amenities of any New York startup, and we have people who work remotely all over the world. We keep meetings and ceremony to an absolute minimum.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/company/work-here/1098165/engineering-manager' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

To that end, we build technology for both voters and election administrators that simplifies the process and ensures that no voter should ever have to miss an election.</p><p><strong>What we do</strong></p><p>TurboVote helps voters register, stay registered, and cast a ballot in every election, from municipal to national. TurboVote served more than 6 million voters in 2018 by building the largest college, nonprofit, and corporate voter engagement coalition in the country, including more than 300 campuses, companies like Starbucks, Univision, Facebook, Google, Snapchat, and dozens more.</p><p>We also manage the The Voting Information Project, which coordinates with state election offices to publish nationally-standardized information about where and how to vote—data that powers everything from Google’s polling place search to our own text message and email reminders to TurboVote users, and received over 120 million impressions in 2016. Ballot Scout helps election administrators track absentee ballots through the mail, providing transparency in the vote-by-mail process and making it easier to follow up when things go awry. And in 2018, we became the organizational home of the National Association of State Election Directors(NASED).</p><p><strong>Software development at Democracy Works</strong></p><p>These products are the work of our 14-developer team. Most of our development involves writing microservices in Clojure running in Docker containers on Kubernetes and hosted on AWS. These services communicate over RabbitMQ and store their data in Datomic. Our users primarily interact with web apps written in ClojureScript and re-frame. We also have projects that use JavaScript, Node, React, Python, and PostgreSQL.</p><p>We pair program, collaborate with product managers, and make sure our efforts deliver value to voters. We define specialized roles and projects on each team so that everyone gets a variety of experience and working relationships and can bring their unique strengths to as wide a swath of our work as possible.</p><p><strong>Where you fit in</strong></p><p>As an&nbsp;<strong>Engineering Manager</strong>, you’ll be supporting and contributing with the Election Administration team at Democracy Works as they build the technology behind The Voting Information Project, Ballot Scout, and other systems that expand the capabilities of the people who run elections.</p><p><strong>You will:</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure that every member of the Election Administration engineering team has solid management and leadership, not just from a technology perspective but also as valued, growing employees of Democracy Works.</li><li>Coordinate with the product and technical leads to ensure that we reliably and sustainably ship high quality software</li><li>Represent the team in planning meetings</li><li>Have regular one on ones with your team to set expectations, give feedback, provide context, support growth, and meet their needs as individuals within Democracy Works</li><li>Work alongside the Election Administration engineering team to deliver features and fix bugs</li><li>Run the hiring and onboarding process for new software developers</li><li>Communicate directly with the VP Engineering, individual developers, and product leads to understand and support their needs and goals</li></ul><p><strong>You are:</strong></p><ul><li>Empathetic, comfortable acting as your team’s biggest advocate</li><li><strong>Capable working with a distributed team across multiple time zones</strong></li><li>Curious</li><li>Adept at bringing people to consensus, but willing to make decisions when the time comes</li><li>A skilled communicator</li><li>A reliable and enthusiastic coach</li></ul><p><strong>You have experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Leading an engineering team, either as an engineering manager or as a technical lead</li><li>Building and deploying complex products, sometimes multiple products simultaneously</li><li>Learning and using a wide range of technologies and tools</li></ul><p><strong>Physical demands:</strong><br>This position requires regular, daily use of a computer.</p><p>To apply, send a resume and brief, informal introduction to Chris using the form below. Please include how you found this job listing. We also encourage all applicants to state their pronouns when applying for any job opening at Democracy Works. From there, we’ll send you a short practical exercise designed to test some of your problem-solving skills, which we’ll anonymize and then evaluate in a blind review. Candidates with strong responses to the practical exercise will go through interview rounds (up to three) with different members of our team who interact closely with this position. We’ll ask for references from our top finalist(s), then make an offer.</p><p>Democracy Works is committed to diversity and inclusion in everything we do and aspires to have a team that’s representative of the voters we serve. When hiring, we practice proactive outreach to top talent that’s underrepresented in our sector (including Latino, Black, AAPI, and Indigenous candidates). We conduct an anonymized skills evaluation, to reduce implicit bias and resume-dependency in our process. We’re a woman- and gay-founded nonprofit, and promote an inclusive culture that stands against racism, sexism, homophobia, and ableism (to name a few). To be explicit, we strongly encourage applicants of all races, ethnicities, political party associations, religions (or lack thereof), national origins, sexual orientations, genders, sexes, ages, abilities, and branches of military service.</p><p>Feel free to contact work@democracy.works if you have any questions about our commitment to inclusion or about general hiring practices, or if you need an accommodation for a medical condition during the hiring process.

In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, New York, or New Jersey as it is difficult for distributed companies like ours to hire in those locations.*</em><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div> The ideal candidate will have professional services (agency) experience, is <b>highly</b> detail oriented, and has a strong fundamental understanding of A/B testing and data-driven decision making.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><b>Direct responsibilities include:</b><br></div><div></div><div></div><ol><li>Managing the client relationship - getting to know our clients' hopes and dreams, setting objectives, pushing back diplomatically, and enabling their success at all times.</li><li>Planning and roadmapping the deliverables and milestones required to meet contractual obligations and program objectives</li><li>Preparing and documenting training resources, decks and deliverables</li><li>Rallying and delegating the resources (both internal and client-side) required for delivering on the objectives of each stage of the program</li><li>Communicating the roadmap and progress through it to all appropriate stakeholders</li><li>Run power check-ins and meetings with clear agendas and next steps. </li><li>Working with the team on experimenting and iterating with the program to deliver a better experience for clients and exceed OKRs (objectives and key results)</li></ol><div><br></div><div></div><div><b>Successful candidates in this role demonstrate:</b><br></div><div></div><div></div><ol><li>An eye for detail and organization. Minor grammatical errors will jump out at you like a sore thumb. Undocumented resources frustrate you. Inbox zero is life. Note that this is not an ability but a strong personal drive to stay organized at all times.</li><li>Comfort communicating and listening diplomatically. Successful program managers listen thoughtfully and address the root problem. They know how to hold not only engineers but also VPs accountable (without hurting feelings). </li><li>Ability to juggle multiple projects at once. Individual tasks in most engagements are generally not insurmountable, however there are many distinct tasks moving at once - keeping them organized and done is paramount.</li><li>Experience and comfort working with teams and people of all shapes and sizes. Every client team will come with their own culture, quirks, and individual likes and desires. Successful program managers are able to assimilate into teams as if they are one of their own as opposed to an outside consultant.</li></ol><div><br></div><div></div><div><b>What crushing it in this role looks like:</b><br></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>Managing the hopes, dreams, and expectations of 10 short-term (3-6 months) clients at a time without breaking a sweat (with the support of a small team).</li><li>A client so excited about the amazing experience they had over the 3 month program that they decide to continue with us for a longer engagement.</li><li>Clients actually do their homework (e.g. Build a test, write a hypothesis) because they want to show you what they can do and don't want to let you down.</li><li>Every meeting is productive, clients always know their progress, and no client ever needs to ask “Hey did you do the thing you said you were going to do?”</li><li>You feel a huge sense of accomplishment helping each team do more with an experimentation mindset than they could've ever imagined. No more meetings where the highest paid person's opinion (HiPPO) wins!</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;mike@crometrics.com.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li>Matching 401k on the first 4% of income subject to a 3 month waiting period.</li><li>100% remote, continue to work from where you are based. (However, this doesn’t mean ultimate freedom, this is a full time job where you get to work from where you live.)</li><li>Liberal vacation policy.</li><li>All the professional gear you need to be successful (e.g. macbook, monitor, and noise-cancelling blackwire headset)</li></ul><div><h4><br></h4></div><div>Our Culture</div><div>Please read our about our culture on our&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/culture' rel='nofollow'>culture page</a>&nbsp;and our main jobs page.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>A unique hiring process – we pay you to interview</h4></div><div>We’ve found that the best candidates shine most when they are able to participate directly with the team and show their skills in action.

If all goes well for both you and Cro Metrics, we will hire you for a paid interview where you start working with us for approximately one week (12-15 hours max) as a 1099 contractor. This can be done on the side of your current full-time job so there is less risk to you.</div><div><br></div><div>If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship into a full time W2 role.

    "content": "Madmagz<br />Madmagz is a French edutech company based in Paris,France. We have created a tool that allows primary and secondary school students to get together and create printable magazines ranging from school based events (such as a collective class magazine)  to bespoke  templates. Having experienced a great deal success in France, we feel that this is a great  time to expand and penetrate the UK market. In order to do this, we need someone based in England who can work remotely,generate leads, travel across London  to present our product to schools and find ways to get members of our target audience interested. We are a very open company with a flat organisational structure so we are always open to listening to any ideas you may have which you feel will help push us along and help us move forward with obtaining more market share and increasing our exposure.<br /><br />We are really open regarding your background but would like someone who has experience in the educational field ( ex headmaster,school  governor etc)<br /><br /><br /><br />",
