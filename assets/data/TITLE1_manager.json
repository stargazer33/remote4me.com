The only recent innovation is around making the calendar view prettier and more useful to the owner. </p><p>The main reason for which we plan our day is because time is the most important commodity in the world. Calendars today are good for recording our daily agenda, but they are terrible at coordinating time with others. We’re focusing on coordinating daily life because that’s where tons of value can be added.

Unfortunately, appointments are spread across many services and we are still wasting a lot of time in back-and-forth emails or phone calls. It's often impossible to share real-time availability with others because Outlook and Google Calendar don't work cross-company.</p><p>FreeBusy is a scheduling assistant powered by A.I. to coordinate meetings 10x faster with contacts inside and outside your company. You can interact with FreeBusy on the web, smartphone, and desktop, using voice, chat, and email. FreeBusy <br>works with existing calendars (Google, Office 365, Exchange, iCloud, Outlook.com, etc.) and you can link as many as you have (work, personal, school). Easily share unified availability with business contacts whether they use FreeBusy or not.</p><p>Our current focus is to increase enterprise agility when scheduling meetings cross-company.

The platform provides tools to create and distribute original content paired to capsule collections with an emphasis on driving traffic to shops that generate sales. The apps and site allow users to intuitively curate collections from multiple affiliate networks to build pop-up stores connected to “window-fronts”. Users generate revenue on organic and sponsored posts (see gif below) while brands can seed products to content creators supported by campaign performance analytics via an admin panel.  </p><p>The service amplifies reach by providing embeddable window-fronts (aka flatlay cards) as customized dynamic units for premium publishers to serve content as native placements. It’s commissioned content crowdsourced as sponsored editorial — the power of actionable creative at scale. </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Los Angeles</span>, <span>San Francisco</span>, <span>Austin</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Digital Media</span>, <span>Mobile Advertising</span>, <span>Image Recognition</span>, <span>Cryptocurrency</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/flatlayapp' rel='nofollow'>@flatlayapp</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://github.com/FLATLAY' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/FLATLAY</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://www.flat-lay.com' rel='nofollow'>flat-lay.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/750/662/750662-550f531bfe84fcacb5e40b6ec2e6ed40a142ee44.png?1475532585' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/493/752493-acf9b3f4c25088b99966d2391f4d8b6bca78fc7c.jpg?1475917752' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/494/752494-f333e8bd7cccbeda5d26e7039a28caf00042de0a.png?1475918143' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/618/752618-d0ab9c5aba91e1f4fb3eefc0f9c6f6dad94d48da.png?1475966575' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/790/387/790387-0f86ee1d3bea48c10f739d1dd9359ddfc0948afa.png?1487320328' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/790/388/790388-10e4042f20b7d144da58fb1fe4d3f191033fbcb4.png?1487320343' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/837/413/837413-3636a99f0809afde0ab2bfd181577f39ffc25b72.png?1507154302' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/837/414/837414-860b6064cf13754231ef38d34a4b2343614b9460.png?1507154392' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/271/866271-f06ff8dd6acc547f18e631073fb6840927d6bb9f.jpeg?1521837553' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/272/866272-5fbbea7e6de533e26f65186342a3d810451ad7d1.jpeg?1521837580' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div></div><div><span>See More</span></div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/273/866273-af3ccfbd7b524b520f8b577d329c4292ec2748f5.jpeg?1521837624' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/274/866274-e960a7ac458f977611c4459baf2b4c341387595e.png?1521837640' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/275/866275-008eafc2c3f4ddd80c40301e27275c0d7bb40ec6.png?1521837726' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/276/866276-d224cedf6c0daadb0d20c487b3e65906eea6ba1e.png?1521837740' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/277/866277-328662640f924a494379259d8fd865fe363b841a.jpeg?1521837754' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/473185-flatlay-the-photo-shop-discover-share-collections?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;FLATLAY®&quot;

If you like solving hard problems, can think analytically, and have the ability to receive a half thought out idea and turn it into an insightful deliverable, please keep reading.</p><h4>Who are we?</h4><p>BuySellAds helps connect great brands with hard to reach audiences. When Google Cloud wants to reach developers, we do the heavy lifting. We’re an adtech company empowering publishers and advertisers to connect more efficiently.</p><p>Don’t let the “adtech” part scare you away: our mission is to help publishers better monetize their sites so they can spend their time focusing on what they care about (their content!) rather than selling ads. We leverage our tech to improve the experience for both sides along the way.</p><p>Digg, CodingHorror.com, Pocket, and Dribbble are just some of the sites who we’re able to help make more money - connecting them with advertisers like Adobe, Microsoft, Google, Slack, and HelloSign, who are all able to expand their reach through us. We sell unique native ads that are often not accessible through programmatic exchanges, reaching a tech-savvy influencer audience.</p><p>We are a fully distributed/remote team, with 45+ people spread out across 30 cities in 6 countries. We connect weekly through a video stand up and talk constantly through Slack. We empower teammates to contribute meaningful results. We largely work around an EST schedule but are flexible.</p><h5>Your Responsibilities:</h5><ul><li>Develop strong understanding of BuySellAds media products</li><li>Work in partnership with the Sales team to understand client objectives and needs</li><li>Assist the lifecycle of a campaign from a sales conversation to a live, successful campaign</li><li>Continually be in the know on our buyer campaigns and analyze for opportunities for improvement alongside sales representatives</li><li>Assist in finding resolutions to issues</li><li>Keep a pulse on all live campaigns for proper serving, click through action, and conversion events</li><li>Assist advertisers with their reporting needs</li><li>Obtain creative/3rd party tags and assist in delivery or creation when needed</li></ul><h5>The Ideal Candidate:</h5><ul><li>Obsessively checks emails and replies at an alarming rate</li><li>Is excited at the opportunity to help marketers achieve complex goals</li><li>Has experience in the advertising industry</li><li>Familiarity with different online advertising pricing structures (CPC, CPM, CPA, etc.)</li><li>Is organized and structured but is not fazed by an out of the box request</li><li>Has the ability to work independently, consistently producing meaningful results</li><li>Is comfortable working remotely</li><li>Ability to adapt in a fast-changing environment</li><li>Strong analytical and problem solving skills</li><li>Ability to prioritize tasks with a proactive “can-do” attitude</li><li>Client-focused mindset with a passion for using data and analytics to drive business results</li><li>Understanding of third-party advertising tags and reporting</li><li>Is obsessive about web tech</li><li>Bonus points for past marketing analyst or sales operation experience</li></ul><h4>Interested?</h4><p>Amazing. To apply, send us a blurb about who you are and what you’re into to salesq32018@buysellads.com. Be sure to include a link to your LinkedIn profile.</p><p>We do our best to make the hiring process fair and straightforward: we do an initial meet-and-greet Zoom screen, and follow with a team pairing to make sure our culture makes sense. We move quickly on decisions, and we aim to respond to every applicant and provide feedback where appropriate: even if we aren’t the right fit for each other, we want you to know rather than have to second-guess.</p>                <div>                    <a href='https://authenticjobs.com/apply/30784' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this Job</a><br>                </div>                <p>&nbsp;</p>                            </div>"
