Delivery is tasked with removing friction from the development and deployment of product features, creatively solving problems, building tooling and automation, evangelising best practices with pragmatism, stewardship of our shared applications and infrastructure, capturing and reporting productivity metrics, and consulting for product teams on complex technical problems. </span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>About the Role</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li><span>This is a management-track position which reports to the Director of Engineering.

You have direct HR responsibility for the engineers on the Delivery team.&nbsp;</li><li>As opportunities arise, you may also work across another product development team and/or take on additional direct reports. Engineering Managers typically have between 5-7 direct reports by their first year.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Our engineering and project teams are distributed across the U.S. and Canada, so that you can cultivate a best-in-class team. You will recruit and hire talented software engineers and facilitate onboarding of new team members.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Ultimately, an engineer’s success within an autonomous cross-functional team (and beyond) is a measure of your success as a leader and mentor. You will actively coach engineers on their day-to-day work and along their career path, conduct regular 1:1s for your reports, and evaluate their performance quarterly—setting actionable goals that help them grow and evolve.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Engineering Managers at Wirecutter play a small part in the hands-on process of building software, but a very large part in orchestrating engineers to achieve great results.

It was a natural outpouring of us targeting “founders” mixed with our founder and his background with publishing. It was easy and in the early days, it worked well, bringing us to where we are today.</p><p>But these aren’t early days anymore. We’re a profitable, five year old company doing over $1M in revenue. We’re “old” in startup years and intend to get even older. While we’re not a brand new company anymore, our growth methodologies and systems are still in their infancy.</p><p>We’re looking for someone who can come in and own “growth” at our company. Someone who loves experimenting and trying new things, but someone who also really genuinely cares about customers and never wants to leave a bad taste in their mouth.</p><p>We’re not looking for a #growthhacker. This isn’t about trying random dark pattern tactics to drive surges in unqualified signups. This is about laying the foundation for the next 10+ years of growth. We don’t have millions in VC funding driving growth at all cost. We’re building a sustainable, long term company that our customers love and our team loves working for.</p><p>You don’t have to have the most experience, but you do have to love learning and love trying new things.</p><p><strong>About Baremetrics</strong></p><p>Baremetrics is a business analytics &amp; insights company. We provide the tools and data businesses need to make solid business decisions.</p><p>Founded in 2013, we’re working hard to help businesses spend less time crunching numbers and looking at spreadsheets and instead give them instant access to metrics and business insights that they need to run their businesses.</p><p>We’re not some flash-in-the-pan startup…we’re five years old, profitable, doing over $1M in revenue and growing. Nearly 1,000 business from all over the world trust us to help them grow their businesses.</p><p>We’re looking for folks who like to solve problems and build a business and product that people genuinely love to interact with.</p><p><strong>Read about working at Baremetrics:&nbsp;</strong><strong>https://baremetrics.com/jobs</strong></p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p>The primary role of this job will be to figure out what knobs need to be turned to help Baremetrics grow…whatever form or whatever channel that may take.</p><p>You don’t need to have experience with any particular software or marketings stacks. We’re not tied to tools, only outcomes.</p><p><strong>The only real requirement here is an affinity for experimenting with growth and marketing channels.</strong></p><p>You’ll spend all your time trying new channels, figuring out which works best for us, scaling them and then monitoring and adjusting as needed.</p><p>Functionally you’ll likely do a lot of the following…</p><ul><li>Product demos</li><li>Sales calls</li><li>A/B testing</li><li>Email marketing</li><li>PPC campaigns</li><li>Social media marketing</li><li>Outbound &amp; inbound marketing</li></ul><p>But ultimately the work you’ll do comes down to the channels you find work best for increasing revenue growth.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Work from anywhere (we’re 100% remote)</strong></li><li><em>Minimum</em>&nbsp;vacation policy</li><li>Competitive salary ($60,000 base + $36,000 variable)</li><li>Profit sharing</li><li>Flexible work hours</li><li>Full health, vision &amp; dental insurance for you and your family</li><li><strong>Annual company meetups</strong></li><li>Kindle Paperwhite + Unlimited Books</li><li><strong>Monthly “remote stipend” that you can use for&nbsp;<em>anything</em></strong></li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://baremetrics.workable.com/jobs/827674' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

THEY DO GET STIPEND TO SURVIVE AND &quot;DO&quot; TOKENS (ERC20). See <a href='https://token.depositoffer.com' rel='nofollow'>https://token.depositoffer.com</a> THIS IS MAINLY A REMOTE POSITION. </p><p>It is probably the hardest thing to get anyone to work here because nobody wants to work for free. I get it. But here at depositoffer.com you are at the brink of making history, no-one had ever designed a system to compete with the federal reserve when it comes to determining interest rate, but I did. And why ? YOU ASK. </p><p>BECAUSE I believe is my right and we should have a say in how much our money is worth to others who wants to borrow. Why not is your bloody money.. How do you feel one day the bank tells you, it is only worth 0.1% and another day 10% ? Have you ever ask how did this banker come up with such figures ? Well if you ask him, he will say something like he does not make the rules, he just followed them. So who makes the rules ? Who decide how much your money is worth ? Yes some unseen panel of men and women. Even the minutes is top secret until declassified. Humm kinda not transparent right ?  </p><p>What if the Feds decide to go NEGATIVE like in Japan ? This means you have to pay the bank to deposit. You will be crying for sure. </p><p>The FEDS's weapon is printing money as a way to manipulate interest rate/cost but we can't print money at all or be arrested. But collectively we can control and restrict where our funds will go and indirectly challenge how funds can be applied. For instance, it is just crazy to have low rates to support a stock-market. For traditional business, it is a challenge to get funding unless you are a crazy startup wanting to go to the moon or make driverless car, then VC with their cheap funds will pile in. So unless you have some crazy ideas like going to MARS while people on earth don't even have a place to live.....then you probably shouldn't be reading this. Hey is a free world you can do what you want to do until someone says you are naked. </p><p>So if you want to develop the patented technology that will one day disrupt the most powerful group of people (the FEDS) by giving the depositors some control on how they want to use their deposits then come and give me a hand. </p><p>I can't promise you will be rich but I can promise you that this will be different to any startup as the rules are not even written yet. If you have ETHER, my depositoffer.com ICO is running take a look at <a href='https://token.depositoffer.com' rel='nofollow'>https://token.depositoffer.com</a> and submit your interest, payments is to be in DO tokens. The Deposit Offer method can be described as follows.

Our goal is to help rid the world of bad software - not a small task! We believe that providing best-in-class customer support is just as important as the software and services we provide. Our support staff is the face of our organization - the manifestation of our ideals and love for our users.</p><p>We have grown slowly and remained agile for over ten years now, and that's something we really treasure. When you join our team, you join our circle of friends.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>Here are a few things we believe are required to do the CET Sales Support &amp; Special Projects job well.</p><p><strong>You are Accurate and Organized</strong><br>To be successful in this role you'll need to be&nbsp;<strong>focused</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>detail-oriented</strong>&nbsp;and good at&nbsp;<strong>self-management</strong>. We are looking for someone who in addition to dealing with daily sales support tickets, will bring skills in&nbsp;<strong>Project Management</strong>. You know how to take a new task, research it, figure out the steps required to deliver the work on time, and&nbsp;<strong>communicate to others</strong>&nbsp;about it.</p><p><strong>You have Empathy</strong><br>We believe this is the single most important attribute of an awesome sales support person. Being able to&nbsp;<strong>jump into a user's shoes</strong>&nbsp;(and walk around a bit) gives you the best perspective to help them. Our company also strives to focus on empathy in our interactions with each other, as well as with our partners and vendors. You know how to balance the importance of an efficient process and the goals of the company while still caring for the needs of an individual person.</p><p><strong>You Love Helping People</strong><br>We're looking for someone who&nbsp;<strong>genuinely likes interacting with people</strong>: meeting them, hearing their stories, helping them with their problems, and treating each new customer interaction like the beginning of a long-term friendship.</p><p><strong>You Are Tech Savvy</strong><br>Not only will you be helping customers decide what version of Balsamiq software is best for them, we also work in a remote &quot;virtual&quot; work environment. That means we use a lot of different software to keep our organization moving. You don't need to have a computer science degree, but being&nbsp;<strong>comfortable learning and using new software</strong>&nbsp;to communicate, track projects, and organize information is a must.</p><p><strong>The Work</strong></p><p>You should take the time to read our&nbsp;<a href='https://balsamiq.com/company/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>what it's like to work at Balsamiq</a>&nbsp;page. It will help you decide if we are a good match for you.</p><p>The Sales Support work for this position is currently done by our colleague Anna, but due to recent growth in our company, we've decided to split the work into two positions. The second portion of the work is other sales related projects where our team could use assistance.</p><p>You'll be a member of the Sales Team (also known as the Wow! Division) and work collaboratively with the Tech Support Team (Customer Champions) spread between the US and Europe.</p><p>Your responsibilities will include:</p><ul><li>Sales Support in CET 50%<ul><li>phone and email support for an average of 20 customers a day</li><li>processing orders, refunds, general sales inquiries, lost license keys, basic installation/registration issues, etc</li><li>keeping up to date on basic changes in our software: new features, new prices, and new purchasing processes</li><li>help advise customers to pick the best and most cost effective way to purchase our product for their situation</li><li>help the sales team watch for trends in problems or requests from our customers, to help improve our software and systems</li></ul></li><li>Collaboration and Management of Various Sales-Related Projects 50%<ul><li>The Sales Support team's main focus is helping customers. The nature of the team is not project-heavy, but there are certain areas that we would like to develop, and that's exactly where we could use your help.</li><li>Some of these areas include:<ul><li>strengthening and improving relations with Software Resellers and Partners</li><li>continued development and enhancement of sales processes</li><li>continued enhancement of legal and software licensing best practices</li><li>general project management when it comes to recognizing and taking action when there is a need for improvement</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>",

While you’ll need to understand the technical nuances of our stack and architecture, you’ll be spending almost all of your time on management. We expect that your week will be 30% assisting and answering questions, 30% planning, 30% code review, and 10% coding. Over time, as the team grows, this will skew more heavily away from coding and code review, making it all the more important that you understand and welcome the challenges of management.</p><p>While programming won’t be your main function, you’ll still need strong technical ability. As an engineering leader, you’ll asked to bring technical insight to strategy, architecture, and roadmap discussions. We have a team of talented and capable engineers. You’ll be counted on as a trusted mentor, helping grow their skills and careers. Technical skills and familiarity with our stack are critical for this.</p><p>You should want to judge your performance by the performance of the engineering team as a whole. Ideally, you take delight in finding meaningful ways to connect with and grow your team’s performance and effectiveness, while fostering a culture focused on impact and ownership with accountability. You’ll need to be comfortable enforcing our values, and providing a clear and shared understanding of the team’s direction and priorities.</p><p>You’ll need to be an effective communicator, as you’ll collaborate with the content, marketing, and support teams. It’s important that you have experience communicating across all layers of an organization.</p><p>How You’ll Contribute:</p><p>Help us grow the team from 6 to 15 in the next 18-24 months.<br>Establish a strong engineering culture centered around on-time delivery and accountability.<br>Get engineers to buy into team and organizational goals and priorities.<br>Collaborate with other teams effectively.<br>Work closely with product to create roadmaps and milestones.<br>Resolve conflicts within the team and externally.<br>Advocate for improving reliability and paying down technical debt.</p><p>Must Have:</p><p>4+ years experience as a software manager or team lead<br>3+ years software engineering experience<br>Experience setting technical KPIs<br>Experience with Python<br>A passion for education and improving lives</p><p>Nice To Have:</p><p>Experience managing a distributed team<br>Experience working remotely<br>Strong interest in data science<br>Experience building a positive engineering culture</p><p>These are some of the technologies you'll be working with at Dataquest, though you may end up introducing new ones:</p><p>Our frontend is a modern React/Redux stack.<br>Communication with the backend happens over a combination of websockets, GraphQL, and REST APIs.<br>The main backend is Django on Python 3.<br>We use Docker extensively, both for student code execution, and for deployment of our services.<br>We use Kubernetes on Google Cloud to orchestrate our containers in production.<br>Our data is largely stored in Postgres, with some caching in Redis.</p><p>Why You Want To Work At Dataquest:</p><p>The opportunity to see your impact on the lives of our students every day.<br>The chance to work with an engaged and mission-driven team.<br>The chance to contribute to product direction and decisions.<br>The ability to work remotely.<br>A supportive environment where you can get help when you run into blockers.</p></div>",

In that time, we’ve grown. What started with me pecking away at a keyboard all by my lonesome has turned into a company with nearly 40 employees scattered around the globe. And we’re continuing to grow at a healthy pace.<br><br>But I need your help.<br><br>We've been able to build a completely remote company with a phenomenal culture and happy employees. And I want Acuity to stay that way. It is deeply important to me that our people are happy — more important to me than just raking in profits. But people aren't my forte. And, as we grow, I'm being pulled in many different directions. So we need someone like you to work full-time to maintain our happiness.<br><br>Can you help us to continue to grow and to enjoy our jobs more?<br><br>**REQUIREMENTS**<br><br>Here's some of what you'll be expected to do:<br><br>* Think of new ways to delight remote employees<br>* Oversee our benefits and manage them in conjunction with Justworks (our PEO)<br>* Help ensure job postings and interviews are fair and inclusive<br>* Make sure new employees feel supported even before they start<br>* Work with other folks to organize company retreats<br>* Find ways to keep the pulse of employee morale<br>* Keep me informed of issues so we can solve them together<br>* You're all about ethics, and you want to be sure we're always on the right side of employment laws<br><br><br>Experience in these areas will help:<br><br>* You've helped other managers get better at their jobs<br>* You know your way around insurance (PPO, HMO, and POS are more than just letters slurped from your alphabet soup)<br>* Extending job offers is something you can do in your sleep<br>* You've helped terminate enough people to know how painful it can be, as well as what to do in advance to avoid surprises<br><br>**BENEFITS**<br><br>And by the way?

(You’ll get a $5,000 credit toward continuing your education.)<br><br>If this description sounds like you, there’s a chance that I’d like to offer you $80k-$115k, straight-up cash money.
