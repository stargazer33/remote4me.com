We hold the biggest corporations in the world (and their political allies) to account by mobilising millions of people to take collective action.</p><p>We are aiming to fundamentally reshape the global economy to put people and planet over profit, but we know we can not do it alone. We build partnerships with on-the-ground activists and organisers, and we follow their lead. We innovate, experiment and embrace professional and organizational growth.

Our work has been featured in TechCrunch, Shopify, Ahrefs, and millions of people each month read the content we create for our clients.<br><br></div><div>But we don't have time to share everything we're learning about the world of SEO and Content. That's where you come in.<br><br></div><div>We're looking for a skilled content marketer to help create one of the best marketing blogs online. Someone who can share what's working in the world of Content Marketing, as well as draw on the experience of the best experts in the field.<br><br></div><div>You'd be completely in charge of all content production at Growth Machine. Your goal would be twofold:</div><ul><li>Increase the number of people learning more about content marketing and SEO from us.</li><li>Increase the number of people reaching out to work with us.</li></ul><div>You'd get to look under the hood at how 100+ sites, some doing $100M+ in revenue, are using SEO and content to grow their business. And you'd get special access to some of the best marketers in the world to interview them and share their stories.<br><br></div><div>This is an incredible opportunity for someone experienced in content marketing to make a name for themselves in the online marketing community.<br><br></div><div>We want to have one of the best marketing blogs online, and we want you to be the face of it.</div><h3><strong>What You'll Do</strong></h3><div>You'll be in charge of all things related to content marketing for our business.

We also know tons of incredible marketers at other companies, and we want to share more of their stories. Getting the blog to 100,000+ monthly visitors in under a year is well within the realm of possibility.<br><br></div><div><strong>Grow Our Email List</strong>: We haven't put much effort into our email list, but it could be a great source of future clients. Along with producing content for the blog, you'll be in charge of running an email newsletter sharing the work you're producing.<br><br></div><div><strong>Run Our Social Media</strong>: We are hilariously bad at doing anything on social media right now, but there are big opportunities, especially on Twitter and LinkedIn, to have more of a presence.<br><br></div><div><strong>Repurpose Content to Other Media:</strong> Want to grow our YouTube channel? Take over the podcast we started? You're in charge of finding the best additional content channels for us.<br><br></div><div><strong>Optimize Our Conversion Funnel</strong>: Traffic is great, but it doesn't pay the bills.

He's done most of the marketing up to this point, so he'll be available to help you do anything you want to do in the role.<br><br></div><h3><strong>Requirements</strong></h3><div>While these are not firm requirements, the more of these areas you can demonstrate skill in, the better:<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Content Marketing</strong>. You've grown a site to 100,000+ monthly visitors or been closely involved in a successful content marketing operation.</li><li><strong>Conversion Rate Optimization</strong>. You can optimize a site for conversions, and point to ways you've optimized sites around business goals in the past.</li><li><strong>Entrepreneurial</strong>. You'll need to be creative in your role, so some kind of entrepreneurial impulse is good. Side projects, creative solutions to problems at your company, and experience founding or working for startups are all good signs of this.</li><li><strong>Persistent</strong>. You have the tenacity and willingness to go the distance to get something done.</li><li><strong>Strategic</strong>. You're able to see and communicate the big picture in an inspiring way. You can determine opportunities and threats through comprehensive analysis of current and future trends.</li><li><strong>Attention to detail</strong>. You don't let important details slip through the cracks or derail a project.</li></ul><h3><strong>Benefits</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Remote Work</strong>: Some of us are based in Austin, but you don't have to be. You can work from anywhere in a US timezone.</li><li><strong>Health Insurance:</strong> Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance 100% covered for you and 50% for your family.</li><li><strong>Life Insurance</strong>: We cover life insurance for 2x your salary up to 200k, and you can add up to 500k in additional coverage.</li><li><strong>401k</strong>: You'll have access to a 401k to contribute to from your paychecks and bonuses.</li><li><strong>Stipend</strong>: $50 per month stipend for food and coffee while working</li><li><strong>Profit Sharing</strong>: Each quarter we're profitable, a portion of that profit is split amongst the team.</li><li><strong>Vacation and Holiday</strong>: 20 days paid vacation time, and we take off all major holidays, including a week over the New Year.

We are an innovative campaigning organization that supports people throughout the country to take action through driving impactful campaigns that influence the behavior of people and institutions, shape the outcomes of elections, and expand the realities of what’s possible. We organize to challenge entrenched power, while pursuing economic, racial, and social justice and a vision of a country in which everyone can thrive.<br><br></div><div><br>MoveOn has a particularly important role to play in the Trump era. We are working to defeat Donald Trump and the GOP in 2020 by building a powerful, multiracial, and economic populist<strong></strong>movement that will give voters something to vote<em> for</em>, not just against—and we're also working to defend communities that are on the front lines of Trump and GOP attacks, including immigrants, people of color, the LGBTQ community, and women. In service of that mission, in 2020 and beyond, MoveOn will drive impactful, movement-connected, multichannel, nimble campaigns aimed at impact.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>About the Position<br></strong><br></div><div>The Voter Mobilization Director: Vote Captains is an experienced scaled organizing project manager, relational organizer, and leader who is excited and passionate about driving MoveOn’s Vote Captain relational organizing program that uses every tool at MoveOn’s disposal -- and a massive base of millions of members -- to inspire battleground state voters to turn out to defeat Donald Trump. We are looking for a rigorous, excellent organizer of organizers who knows how to motivate and drive volunteers to action, in particular in a digital context.</div><div><br>The goal of the 2020 Voter Mobilization Team at MoveOn is to turn out 100,000 voters as safely as possible across nine battleground states to vote to defeat Donald Trump, with a focus on who we call “high potential voters” (traditionally called “low propensity voters”) -- young voters, first-time voters, people of color, new Americans and low-income voters who may not have otherwise voted. We also seek to build durable, progressive people power to expand the MoveOn community for ongoing organizing to win positive change in people’s lives in 2020, 2021, and beyond. <br><br>A core part of our strategy to accomplish this goal is to<strong> recruit, train, and organize thousands of “Vote Captains” to take responsibility for safely turning out 10 people they already know to vote </strong>in order to drive turnout to defeat Donald Trump. Vote Captains will call, text, DM, and use a variety of digital and other safe tactics to make sure their 10 voters can cast their votes safely during early voting and/or on Election Day (this includes helping them to make sure they are registered to vote or get registered in time, and helping them to figure out how and when they will vote and what’s required for that, like how to apply for an absentee ballot or cast their vote by mail in time, or how to vote in person safely). Vote Captains will also have the opportunity to join MoveOn’s Volunteer Network to build relationships with and organize in the long term with fellow activists.</div><div><br></div><div>We are also hiring a Digital Voter Mobilization Director --distinct from this role -- who will focus on implementing digital or mobile scalable tactics to drive Democratic voter turnout such as collecting “vote tripling” pledges through p2p, sms broadcast, digital ads, online events, and more. You can find that role here: https://front.moveon.org/careers/?gh_jid=2183740</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Primary Responsibilities<br><br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Responsible for the successful scaling and implementation of MoveOn’s Vote Captains relational organizing program to turn out high potential voters and develop volunteer leadership</li><li><strong>Project Management:&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Build and maintain MoveOn’s voter mobilization task management system and run weekly voter mobilization meetings as they relate to the Vote Captains program, coordinating closely with the Volunteer Network Director, Training Director, and other staff.</li><li>Create and manage a detailed content calendar for Vote Captains (email, SMS, online events, Mobilize community app, etc) designed to build Vote Captains’ skills and leadership, develop relationships and community among Vote Captains, and retain them in the program.</li><li>Create systems for program accountability and evaluation, such as drafting core metrics, designing regular feedback loops from vote captains, customizing a dashboard, writing weekly progress reports, and organizing and writing a comprehensive Vote Captains debrief report after the conclusion of the election.</li><li>Ensure the Vote Captains plan and implementation is legally compliant and respectful of MoveOn’s allies.</li><li>Liaise with external partners to amplify the Vote Captains voter mobilization work.</li><li><strong>Strategy and Implementation:</strong></li><li>Recruit and retain thousands of Vote Captains across nine states.<strong></strong>You create and implement a multichannel recruitment, retention, and organizing strategy that could include peer to peer SMS, digital ads, email, distributed virtual events, MoveOn’s existing Mobilizer community of trained action-takers, and other creative tactics with clear benchmarks that increase over time, working with teammates who manage those realms. You draft and send recruitment materials through appropriate signoff processes. You get on the phone or video with volunteers from time to time!</li><li>Design and manage scaled, horizontal &amp; vertical systems of support for up to 5,000 Vote Captains.

We are proud to deliver high quality, well-loved software (and some hardware) to music lovers and audiophiles all over the world. Our subscribers are more than customers; they’re fans who share our passion for music and participate vigorously in the community that surrounds our product, which has become the gold standard for music players in the “audiophile” world.</p><p>Roon Labs is a self-funded, profitable small business founded in 2015 which currently has 20 employees. All of its principals are hands-on and work for the company full time. We’re growing at a quick but manageable pace –&nbsp;80-100% year-on-year subscriber growth.&nbsp;</p><p>When we founded the company, we set out to delight the most demanding music enthusiasts and audiophiles, not to acquire a billion users. That vision stands today… we don’t have outside investors because we don’t want our product vision to conflict with our business goals. Roon is a premium-priced offering designed for a specialist audience, so we don’t need massive scale and we avoid the risk of being forced into an exit by business pressures.</p><p>Roon Labs is notionally headquartered in New York, but we have no offices. Instead, our team is distributed across three continents, and everyone works remotely. Many members of our team travel extensively around the world. We have a long history of working this way, and we love the flexibility and lifestyle that it allows.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health/Dental/Vision (80/20)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k with match</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Paid Parental Leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Time Off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full Time Remote</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

I’m the co-founder and CEO of Skup, a remote-first Shopify app company that gives you everything you need to quickly start, grow and scale your e-commerce business.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Our team of 17 people (based all over the world), work to develop unique tools and training that can transform our customer’s Shopify stores into multi million-dollar businesses. It’s pretty amazing to hear our customer results (and the thing that drives us the most). <br><br>I’m writing this unusually personal post from the first person because I’m in need of help (and I’m hoping you can be the right person to solve this problem ) .&nbsp;<br><br>As a marketing and creative-first CEO, I’ve been struggling over the past few years to scale the company as fast as we’ve grown. Quite honestly, we have amazing team members, but we’ve never had an Operations person to make the entire machine run smoothly. I’ve tried, but it’s just not my best skill set.&nbsp;<br><br>Now that we’ve really found our stride, I’m hoping to find the perfect fit for our company and to bring on someone who is excited about transforming Skup into the best version of itself.&nbsp;<br><br>As a company, we’ve been built upon certain values within our team. We aim to grow a</div><div>family that is always:<br><br></div><ul><li>Honest and Insightful</li><li>Engaging and Well-informed</li><li>Solution Experts</li><li>Proactive and Consistent</li></ul><div><br></div><div>From a high-level, here are my current expectations of the role (but, who knows… this may change dependent on our needs):<br><br></div><ul><li>Meet the team (we use Slack) - set up 1:1’s, review meetings, and get to know everyone. The team aspect will be the most important part of the job!</li><li>Review our current organizational systems and audit what we have</li><li>Create new operational systems for the company to build upon (operational, engineering, HR, customer success, and finance)</li><li>Creating team OKR’s to work towards as a team (each department)</li><li>Add documentation and materials into Notion (our company Wiki)</li><li>Meetings with department heads for on-going projects (you’ll be meeting with me, our CTO, and any other leads who are involved)</li><li>Bi-Weekly meeting with myself to go over Business Development ideas and project scopes (we can set up a time that works best for you)</li><li>Day to day focus on management processes, implementing new ideas, and working with team members to solve problems&nbsp;</li><li>Hiring process updates and being the lead to hire, onboarding, and manage new team members</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Honestly, it’ll be a role that has many responsibilities, but the general goal will simply be to help our team run more efficiently.&nbsp;<br><br>Since we’ll be working together on such a close basis, I wanted to hear more about what YOU think it’ll take to succeed in this role.&nbsp;<br><br>If you can respond with an email to Connect@skup.net with subject line “Systems for SKUP” and outline:<br><br></div><div>1) What do you think are the most important qualities you need to thrive in a team like this?<br><br>2) What do you think is critical for a CEO - Operations relationship to effectively communicate and execute on a day to day basis?<br><br>3) What is it about Operations that you love so much?&nbsp;<br><br>4) Not required, but always is helpful: Shoot a short video explaining more about yourself and what’s getting you excited about SKUP.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is a fully remote, full-time position and we’ll be happy to invest in you, as well!</div><div><br>As a US employee you will earn:<br><br></div><ul><li>Strong competitive salary (based on experience)</li><li>Potential revenue share based on performance</li><li>Incentivized bonuses based on OKR Progress</li><li>PPO Insurance (Health, Dental, Vision &amp; Life) (We Pay 75%)</li><li>$1,000/Year in travel credits (Airbnb, or the airline of your choice)</li><li>$360/Year in “Pet funds” for your furry friends</li><li>$720/Year towards your gym membership</li><li>$240/Year towards your music subscription (Spotify, Pandora)</li><li>$180/Year towards learning another language (Babbel, Duolingo)</li></ul><div><br></div><div>You’ll also earn benefits after 2 months:<br><br></div><ul><li>20 Vacation Days Per Year</li><li>Unlimited Book/Audiobook fund</li><li>Mentorship program reimbursement</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We’re hoping you are a fit and excited to have you possibly join the SKUP Family - a team of intelligent, driven and friendly individuals with one goal in mind: to better the lives of others in the e-commerce space.</div></div>",

We are working to solve the problem of the ‘memory hole’, as formulated by George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four, by building the first data storage medium that truly never forgets. Arweave works by rewarding network participants for contributing hard disk space to the network, in a similar fashion to proof of work in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\\n\\n\\nWhat you’ll do\\n\\nBeing Head of Developer Adoption at Arweave will require you to manage our team of developer advocates, as they grow and strengthen the Arweave developer community. Together with this team, you will:&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* Devise, execute, evaluate and refine creative developer acquisition strategies.\\n\\n* Build and refine developer reward programmes for incentivising adoption of the Arweave network, focussing on tangible, clear outcomes.\\n\\n* Manage relationship life cycles with individual community members that apply for our grant and investment programmes, from sourcing to completion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Yourself\\n\\nYou are a strong communicator, work well in distributed teams and have proven technical aptitudes. Crucially, you have played a pivotal role in gaining the adoption of a developer-focused protocol/product at least once before.&nbsp;\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\nBy providing permanent, low-cost, and truly censorship-resistant data storage for everyone, we strive to democratise the information space. To achieve this, our team has built and now supports an online, open source, blockchain-based network providing decentralised data storage distributed worldwide.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* We’re an English-language team of very skilled and highly motivated entrepreneurs and hackers with diverse academic and professional backgrounds.\\n\\n* In spring 2018, we graduated from the Techstars Berlin accelerator programme and have access to a worldwide network of expert advisors and investors.\\n\\n* We count with the support of notable investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures, Multicoin Capital and Coinbase Ventures. You can read recent coverage about Arweave here and here.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArweave is an equal opportunity employer and welcomes applications from everybody.  </div> </div>",

We also recognize that families are part of our daily lives and we like that they often turn up on our video calls. **All about you*** **You really dig web tech.** You've been in the web technology sector for a while and you like it.

Your integrity shines like a sunbeam.* **You're most of the above.** But not necessarily all of them.

We are informal, structurally flat, and fun to work with. **A little more about our culture**Biteable is a bit of rarity. Everyone genuinely cares about each other. When asked, they use words like these to describe their colleagues: rigorous, respectful, open, supportive, honest, and egoless. Don't just take our word for it, though. Here are a few quotes that we didn't make up: _“I’m thankful for the flexibility Biteable gives me around my family commitments. I really like that my team is open to new ideas and processes. And I enjoy that I get to work on a variety of problems with a mix of people with diverse areas of expertise.”__“The development team is a great group of people. They’re smart and interested in doing high-quality work, but foster a social and supportive atmosphere, too.”__“Biteable's team of smart, funny, engaged, and caring people makes my work here enjoyable, every day. Being close to decisions and decision-makers helps me make an impact on our work.”__“At Biteable, you’re given the support and flexibility you need to do your best work in a way that suits your lifestyle. I’m continuously impressed by this team’s skill and unwavering passion. But what’s more, is that everyone operates with kindness, respect, and a great sense of humor.”_**How to apply**We want you to start soon.

We're looking for a Technical Project Manager to help our product teams achieve big results in a wonderfully coordinated fashion. If you like working in a busy, quirky environment where the well-being of the team comes first, this might the thing for you.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></div><div><strong>A little about the Biteable culture</strong>&nbsp;</div><div><br>At Biteable we're committed to the happiness of our staff. We love it when everyone feels supported and we doubly love it when everyone feels empowered to create.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>The Biteable team is scattered around the globe from San Francisco to Hobart, and lots of places in between. Our diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives are the glue that binds us.&nbsp;</div><div><br>We treat each other like adults and we set our own schedules. We also recognize that families are part of our daily lives and we like that they often turn up on our video calls.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></div><div><strong>All about you</strong>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><ul><li><strong>You really dig web tech.</strong> You've been in the web technology sector for a while and you like it. Stuff that runs in a browser is what floats your boat.</li><li><strong>You're good at big projects.</strong> You love running medium to large software development projects. And you've got plenty of experience doing it.</li><li><strong>You're agile.</strong> Like a tiger, but then in an office and with fingers instead of claws. To be exact, you've got direct experience using Agile methodologies for managing projects and coaching teams.</li><li><strong>You know your stuff.</strong> You're an expert at project management, bug tracking, and reporting tools.</li><li><strong>You're driven.</strong> You've got superior organizational skills and you're great at following through on tasks. Your integrity shines like a sunbeam.</li><li><strong>You're most of the above.</strong> But not necessarily all of them. You like to learn and you pick up new things quickly.</li></ul><div><br><br></div><div><strong>All about the role</strong>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><ul><li><strong>You’ll manage your own schedule.</strong> While you’ll need to maintain regular work hours (for the benefit of your team), you’re free to lay your day out the way you like it.</li><li><strong>You'll spin many plates.</strong> Like an artist, you'll drive multiple projects simultaneously, all the way from start to finish.</li><li><strong>You'll manage four product teams.</strong> Your daily activities will include scoping, resourcing, and tracking progress across all four teams.</li><li><strong>You'll facilitate communication.</strong> In particular, you'll take care of sprint planning, standups, sprint reviews, retrospectives, and release planning.</li><li><strong>You'll make things transparent.</strong> You'll provide cross-functional visibility into status, resourcing needs, dependencies, granular requirements, dates and escalations for projects.</li><li><strong>You'll work collaboratively</strong> with Product &amp; Engineering. And you'll communicate updates to all other functions.</li><li><strong>You'll have one eye on the customer.</strong> In everything you do, you'll be focused on delivering value to Biteable customers.</li></ul><div><br><strong>All about us</strong>&nbsp;</div><div><br>We are Biteable, a tech start-up that makes (jaw-dropping) videos possible for everyone. We stand apart in our market thanks to our dedication to studio-quality content and our passion for simplicity.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>Since our launch in 2014 we’ve:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Created a community of over 6 million users</li><li>Rendered more than 10 million videos</li><li>Raised $3.9 million in venture capital</li></ul><div>We’re growing fast and have offices in Melbourne and Hobart, Australia, with remote team members scattered around the world. We are informal, structurally flat, and fun to work with.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><br><br>A little more about our culture</strong>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>Biteable is a bit of rarity. Everyone genuinely cares about each other. When asked, they use words like these to describe their colleagues: rigorous, respectful, open, supportive, honest, and egoless.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Don't just take our word for it, though. Here are a few quotes that we didn't make up:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><em>“I’m thankful for the flexibility Biteable gives me around my family commitments. I really like that my team is open to new ideas and processes. And I enjoy that I get to work on a variety of problems with a mix of people with diverse areas of expertise.”</em>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><em>“The development team is a great group of people. They’re smart and interested in doing high-quality work, but foster a social and supportive atmosphere, too.”</em>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><em>“Biteable's team of smart, funny, engaged, and caring people makes my work here enjoyable, every day. Being close to decisions and decision-makers helps me make an impact on our work.”</em>&nbsp;</div><div><em><br>“At Biteable, you’re given the support and flexibility you need to do your best work in a way that suits your lifestyle. I’m continuously impressed by this team’s skill and unwavering passion. But what’s more, is that everyone operates with kindness, respect, and a great sense of humor.”</em>&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br></div><div><strong>How to apply</strong>&nbsp;</div><div><br>We want you to start soon. To apply, dispatch your CV and a short cover letter about why you and Biteable fit together like a kanban board and a calendar.&nbsp;</div><div><br>We’ll review your application and then set up informal interviews with a handful of candidates. We've got our fingers crossed that you're one of them — we're rooting for you.&nbsp;</div></div>",

We&nbsp;encourage everyone&nbsp;to work in a whichever manner that helps&nbsp;them&nbsp;perform&nbsp;their&nbsp;best.</p><h3><strong>ABOUT THE ROLE:</strong></h3><p>You’ll be responsible for overseeing and managing all aspects of transportation, warehousing, and order fulfillment for Nathan James. You’ll help the operations team by managing relationships with all logistics 3rd&nbsp;parties, assisting with high level planning, continual improvement implementation, and creative cost reduction ideation/execution. As the driver of the Logistics Division, you will also have ample opportunity to carve out your own passion projects related to operational improvements and cost reductions.</p><p>A deep understanding of operations management, particularly focused on inbound and outbound modeling, is a pre-requisite for succeeding in this role.&nbsp; Managing both an internal team and external partners also requires being able to provide support from multiple perspectives regarding any aspect related to operational processes.&nbsp; Since this division and these processes are susceptible to continual change, the ideal candidate has the unique ability to quickly learn and teach these procedures.</p><p>During training, you’ll be expected to be proactive in your process and learn quickly. Once fully up-to-speed (2-3 months), you’ll have a complete understanding and ownership of day-to-day operations, provide managerial guidance to members of the Logistics Division, have the ability to monitor and report on Logistics KPIs, as well as, be able to verify and approve all invoices related to the Logistics Division.</p><h3><strong>ABOUT US:</strong></h3><p>We have a rhythm to our work and a very low turnover rate — we have yet to have a single team member opt-out.

You’re free to work where you work best, anywhere in the world: home office, coworking space, or coffee shops. You should be comfortable working remotely, that hinges on effective writing, self-discipline, and comfort with open communication.</p><h3><strong>BENEFITS &amp; PERKS:</strong></h3><p>Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived, both at work and away from work.</p><p>We’re all about reasonable working hours, sharing, ample vacation time, wellness, education, comfort, and giving back.

    "content": "Elucidate AI (Stealth)| Head of Engineering | San Francisco, CA | Onsite preferred, can discuss remote<p>In a time of economic uncertainty, it’s critical that companies fire their limited bullets wisely. Yet, even in the best times, smart companies consistently focus on goals that are predictably bad (e.g. 1x levers instead of 100x levers). Why do companies pursue predictably bad goals? The root causes are that companies are complex, the world is uncertain, and current tools don’t do a great job helping leaders understand how the pieces fit together to generate growth. As a result, teams operate via a combination of heuristics and siloed local optimizations, all of which are subject to error and obfuscate what’s really important. This creates hundreds of billions of dollars in waste since goal quality is a multiplier on efforts.</p><p>Our technology helps reveal the right goals.

It&rsquo;s our mission to accelerate and enable the world&rsquo;s transition to a quantum future;&nbsp; and to be at the core of this revolution by building truly scalable quantum capabilities with simple &amp; flexible systems. At their core, these processors are based on superconducting circuit technology.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>ROLE OVERVIEW:</strong></p><br /><p>This role is a joint role as a Senior Quantum Engineer and Laboratory Manager. The role will require flexible distribution across both role responsibilities. As OQC is currently in the process of setting up a new quantum laboratory facility, we expect that the Laboratory Manager role will initially be a key responsibility, requiring 70% of your time for the first 6 months. As the laboratory operations move to regular operation procedures, and responsibilities are distributed across the team this is expected to reduce to around 30% of your time.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>LAB MANAGER:</strong></p><br /><p>As a Laboratory Manager, you&rsquo;ll be drawing on your previous experience being responsible with the day to day operation and running of a quantum laboratory.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to set up, shape and develop processes to ensure an effective, efficient and safe day-to-day laboratory operation. You&rsquo;ll work closely with external contractors, partners, suppliers, OQC&rsquo;s quantum engineers, and operations team to achieve this.

YES?! So do we! At Corsearch, our teams live and breathe trademarks. As funny as that sounds, there’s no pushing brand establishment and protection from our thoughts. We’re thinking about coined trademarks in the car, a detailed design search over lunch, Common Law while sitting with the in-laws, and transportation trademarks on the treadmill. It’s what we do. And people come to Corsearch to be challenged, developed, supported, and valued.</p><p><strong>Our Tech team</strong></p><p>We have a very flat, non-hierarchical and friendly team approach. You’ll be working with an experienced team who also has technical experience, including seasoned technology folks who love the work we do and has excellent complementary skills.
