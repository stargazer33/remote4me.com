But we&rsquo;re also a team of dedicated (self-proclaimed) nerds, tech is what we know and love. So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Why Deliveroo?</strong><br />When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.</p><br /><p>We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are already transforming the way people think about food, providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.</p><br /><p>We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauces that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.</p><br /><p>And we&rsquo;re just getting started.</p><br /><p>The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at &pound;7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it&rsquo;s clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.</p><br /><p>We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT&rsquo;s&rsquo; list of Europe&rsquo;s fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte&rsquo;s &lsquo;UK Top 50&rsquo; two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.</p><br /><p><strong>About the Production Platform Group</strong><br />The production platform group build, maintain and secure services, tooling and infrastructure that is relied upon by the rest of the company to provide excellent service to our customers, riders and restaurants.</p><br /><p>Furthermore, the teams all play a consultancy role to the other product engineering teams, evangelizing and helping the adoption of said services, tools and infra as well as helping to build reliability guidelines.</p><br /><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong><br />There are three core areas; planning, communications and engineering processes.</p><br /><p><strong>Day to day:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Work with the engineers to build a roadmap, prioritize and execute the backlog</li><br /><li>Track issues and find solutions for programme problems as they arise</li><br /><li>Stakeholder management: This is a critical role for Deliveroo to make sure both external and internal teams are working toward the same goal and managing communication &amp; changes. You&rsquo;ll need to advocate for all stakeholders throughout the program to ensure they have the support needed to succeed</li><br /><li>Process optimisation: It&rsquo;s essential that we continue to learn. You&rsquo;ll be responsible for identifying where we can improve, and making sure that we execute required changes across teams</li><br /><li>Workflow improvement: You will work closely with your team to define and maintain work practices, tools and guidelines across the team</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Skills include:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Passion for working with devops and infrastructure teams</li><br /><li>Interpersonal skills to build relationships, and collaborate with diverse geographically distributed teams</li><br /><li>Manage multiple facets of a large-scale project and track progress</li><br /><li>Work on many tasks at once, which makes multitasking skills a must-have</li><br /><li>Solve problems to keep multiple programmes of work on track</li><br /><li>Work effectively in a constantly evolving and ambiguous environment</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Experience:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>3+ years of industry experience as a Technical Programme Manager</li><br /><li>Ability to effectively articulate technical challenges to all org levels</li><br /><li>Incident management experience</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Life at Deliveroo</strong><br />We are a growing team, with a very large impact, seeking to solve some of the most interesting challenges out there. We move fast, we&rsquo;re always looking for new ideas and the entire company is very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.</p><br /><p>There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven&rsquo;t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours to work on. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.</p><br /><p><strong>Benefits and Diversity</strong><br />At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.</p><br /><p>In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role, to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company&rsquo;s success.</p><br /><p>We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around.</p>",

As we believe that no two people are the same and that there is no “one fits all” solution, “individual” is the keyword here.</li><li>You’ll work closely with the MoCs (Master of Ceremonies) of our teams and help them on their road to continuous improvement. You are the people person for those teams when it comes to moderation of retros as well as a sparring partner for people issues. We encourage self-organization a lot, but if there is a need for your support, you are there.</li><li>You foster our self-organization throughout the company, enabling individuals and teams to make their own decisions with confidence, allowing the company to remain a group of individuals walking in the same direction. Nobody is left behind. You ensure this structure is under constant review and communicated in a way that makes it understandable for all involved.</li><li>You will work with diverse parties of the organization on topics such as team development, self-organisation, individual growth, responsibilities and accountability. We strongly believe in agility and want to continue being at the forefront of the new work era. All your initiatives need to fit in our remote and agile context.</li><li>To learn more about how we work, you can check out the Inside Giant Swarm Blog Posts: https://blog.giantswarm.io/inside/</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>You have at least 5+ years experience in working in People Operations (or in an agile consulting company) and you’ll survive the fact that we really like iterating. We will never have a final plan, knowing that things that work today won’t work tomorrow. Uncertainty is your motivator.</li><li>You can give proposals, and defend them when challenged, in a very self-organized environment where obviously everyone has an opinion about people topics as it affects us all.</li><li>You have been working in a startup environment and having worked remotely already is a plus as this will help you understand the challenges that come with working in this way, as few companies are currently organised this way</li><li>You’re happy to hop between individual (people) and organisation levels. In the beginning, it will be more organizational work.</li><li>You have a strong interest and at best you already have experience in agile methodologies. It would be great if you have already worked with software teams. Our purpose is to create similar structures in the entire company, so if you have experience there – great!</li><li>Being a certified coach and or scrum master is a big plus</li><li>You are happy with English as our company language</li></ul><p><strong>Why we think this job is worth applying (challenge us!):</strong></p><ul><li>Impact, Impact, Impact! We are a remote-first organization with a growing team (from 15+ European countries) Every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.</li><li>“It’s better to ask forgiveness than permission” (Paolini) – sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which, is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things by the guidebook. You can try things out! Our default to 100% transparency will help you here.</li><li>Appreciation and trust are the columns for our People Operations work. We try not to use “new work” as a buzzword, we try to live it. Larissa, Mirco and Anna (your future colleagues can talk for hours about that ;))</li></ul><p><strong>WHY Giant Swarm?</strong></p><p>We can give you a glimpse on how working with us will be like:</p><p><strong>Self-organization</strong></p><p>Creative work needs freedom and openness. We encourage you to do your work wherever and whenever you want. We expect passion and encourage sustainability. If you need rest, take it. We don’t count holidays – we count outcome.</p><p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p><p>We are a growing company with 50+ team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible. Always question the status quo and find new ways of collaboration and team-work.</p><p><strong>Learning</strong></p><p>Learning is mandatory and fun at the same time. If you realize you want to expand your knowledge in a specific area, we support you with conferences, books etc.</p><p><strong>Basics</strong></p><p>We offer fair (transparent and open) salaries with benefits like choosing your own laptop, additional perks (for example, a location-aware, fixed amount paid each month to cover costs like co-working, phone contracts or gym memberships), paid parental leave and healthcare compensation are compulsory.

As we believe that no two people are the same and that there is no “one fits all” solution, “individual” is the keyword here.\\n\\n* You’ll work closely with the MoCs (Master of Ceremonies) of our teams and help them on their road to continuous improvement. You are the people person for those teams when it comes to moderation of retros as well as a sparring partner for people issues. We encourage self-organization a lot, but if there is a need for your support, you are there.\\n\\n* You foster our self-organization throughout the company, enabling individuals and teams to make their own decisions with confidence, allowing the company to remain a group of individuals walking in the same direction. Nobody is left behind. You ensure this structure is under constant review and communicated in a way that makes it understandable for all involved.\\n\\n* You will work with diverse parties of the organization on topics such as team development, self-organisation, individual growth, responsibilities and accountability. We strongly believe in agility and want to continue being at the forefront of the new work era. All your initiatives need to fit in our remote and agile context.\\n\\n* To learn more about how we work, you can check out the Inside Giant Swarm Blog Posts:&nbsp;https://blog.giantswarm.io/inside/\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* You have at least 5+ years experience in working in People Operations (or in an agile consulting company) and you’ll survive the fact that we really like iterating. We will never have a final plan, knowing that things that work today won't work tomorrow. Uncertainty is your motivator.\\n\\n* You can give proposals, and defend them when challenged, in a very self-organized environment where obviously everyone has an opinion about people topics as it affects us all.\\n\\n* You have been working in a startup environment and having worked remotely already is a plus as this will help you understand the challenges that come with working in this way, as few companies are currently organised this way\\n\\n* You’re happy to hop between individual (people) and organisation levels. In the beginning, it will be more organizational work.\\n\\n* You have a strong interest and at best you already have experience in agile methodologies. It would be great if you have already worked with software teams. Our purpose is to create similar structures in the entire company, so if you have experience there - great!\\n\\n* Being a certified coach and or scrum master is a big plus\\n\\n* You are happy with English as our company language\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;Why we think this job is worth applying (challenge us!)\\n\\n\\n* Impact, Impact, Impact! We are a remote-first organization with a growing team (from 15+ European countries) Every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.\\n\\n* “It's better to ask forgiveness than permission” (Paolini) - sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which, is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things by the guidebook. You can try things out! Our default to 100% transparency will help you here.\\n\\n* Appreciation and trust are the columns for our People Operations work. We try not to use “new work” as a buzzword, we try to live it. Larissa, Mirco and Anna (your future colleagues can talk for hours about that ;))\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHY Giant Swarm?\\n\\nWe can give you a glimpse on how working with us will be like:\\n\\nSelf-organization\\n\\nCreative work needs freedom and openness. We encourage you to do your work wherever and whenever you want. We expect passion and encourage sustainability. If you need rest, take it. We don't count holidays - we count outcome.\\n\\nTeamwork\\n\\nWe are a growing company with 50+ team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible. Always question the status quo and find new ways of collaboration and team-work.\\n\\nLearning\\n\\nLearning is mandatory and fun at the same time. If you realize you want to expand your knowledge in a specific area, we support you with conferences, books etc.\\n\\nBasics\\n\\nWe offer fair (transparent and open) salaries with benefits like choosing your own laptop, additional perks (for example, a location-aware, fixed amount paid each month to cover costs like co-working, phone contracts or gym memberships), paid parental leave and healthcare compensation are compulsory. And you will participate in our stock options program. Currently, our team members have more children than we are employees. So family-friendliness is a must.\\n\\nWe are not hiring job descriptions. We hire humans. :)\\n\\nWe welcome applications from everybody, regardless of ethnic or national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or age.\\n\\nInterested? Questions? Coffee?

TurboVote signed up its six millionth voter in 2018 by building the largest college, nonprofit, and corporate voter engagement coalition in the country, including more than 300 campuses, companies like Starbucks, Univision, Facebook, Google, Snap, and dozens more. We also helped (basically) everyone find their polling place through the Voting Information Project. Its data had 123 million impressions in 2016, and over 11 million voters looked up where to vote on GetToThePolls.com. Ballot Scout helps election administrators track absentee ballots through the mail, providing transparency in the vote-by-mail process and making it easier to follow up when things go awry. And in 2018, we became the organizational home of the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED).</p><p>As a Product Manager on the Election Administration team, you’ll be working from end-to-end to manage the development of The Voting Information Project – from roadmapping high-level product strategy down into the details of planning sprints and coordinating partner support.

As we believe that no two people are the same and that there is no “one fits all” solution, “individual” is the keyword here.</li><li>You’ll work closely with the MoCs (Master of Ceremonies) of our teams and help them on their road to continuous improvement. You are the people person for those teams when it comes to moderation of retros as well as a sparring partner for people issues. We encourage self-organization a lot, but if there is a need for your support, you are there.</li><li>You foster our self-organization throughout the company, enabling individuals and teams to make their own decisions with confidence, allowing the company to remain a group of individuals walking in the same direction. Nobody is left behind. You ensure this structure is under constant review and communicated in a way that makes it understandable for all involved.</li><li>You will work with diverse parties of the organization on topics such as team development, self-organisation, individual growth, responsibilities and accountability. We strongly believe in agility and want to continue being at the forefront of the new work era. All your initiatives need to fit in our remote and agile context.</li><li>To learn more about how we work, you can check out the Inside Giant Swarm Blog Posts:&nbsp;<a href='https://blog.giantswarm.io/inside/' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.giantswarm.io/inside/</a></li></ul><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have at least 5+ years experience in working in People Operations (or in an agile consulting company) and you’ll survive the fact that we really like iterating. We will never have a final plan, knowing that things that work today won't work tomorrow. Uncertainty is your motivator.</li><li>You can give proposals, and defend them when challenged, in a very self-organized environment where obviously everyone has an opinion about people topics as it affects us all.</li><li>You have been working in a startup environment and having worked remotely already is a plus as this will help you understand the challenges that come with working in this way, as few companies are currently organised this way</li><li>You’re happy to hop between individual (people) and organisation levels. In the beginning, it will be more organizational work.</li><li>You have a strong interest and at best you already have experience in agile methodologies. It would be great if you have already worked with software teams. Our purpose is to create similar structures in the entire company, so if you have experience there - great!</li><li>Being a certified coach and or scrum master is a big plus</li><li>You are happy with English as our company language</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;Why we think this job is worth applying (challenge us!)</strong></p><ul><li>Impact, Impact, Impact! We are a remote-first organization with a growing team (from 15+ European countries) Every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.</li><li>“It's better to ask forgiveness than permission” (Paolini) - sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which, is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things by the guidebook. You can try things out! Our default to 100% transparency will help you here.</li><li>Appreciation and trust are the columns for our People Operations work. We try not to use “new work” as a buzzword, we try to live it. Larissa, Mirco and Anna (your future colleagues can talk for hours about that ;))</li></ul><p><strong>WHY Giant Swarm?</strong></p><p>We can give you a glimpse on how working with us will be like:</p><p><strong>Self-organization</strong></p><p>Creative work needs freedom and openness. We encourage you to do your work wherever and whenever you want. We expect passion and encourage sustainability. If you need rest, take it. We don't count holidays - we count outcome.</p><p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p><p>We are a growing company with 50+ team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible. Always question the status quo and find new ways of collaboration and team-work.</p><p><strong>Learning</strong></p><p>Learning is mandatory and fun at the same time. If you realize you want to expand your knowledge in a specific area, we support you with conferences, books etc.</p><p><strong>Basics</strong></p><p>We offer fair (transparent and open) salaries with benefits like choosing your own laptop, additional perks (for example, a location-aware, fixed amount paid each month to cover costs like co-working, phone contracts or gym memberships), paid parental leave and healthcare compensation are compulsory. And you will participate in our stock options program. Currently, our team members have more children than we are employees. So family-friendliness is a must.</p><p>We are not hiring job descriptions. We hire humans. :)</p><p>We welcome applications from everybody, regardless of ethnic or national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or age.</p><p>Interested? Questions? Coffee?

All workflows are created to function remotely - but of course, if you want to visit Cologne, you are more than welcome!</p><p>While we are remote first, we appreciate quality time with our co-workers, so we meet in person twice a year to work and have fun together.</p><p><strong>Work-life integration</strong></p><ul><li>Flexible working hours, and working from home or anywhere you prefer but please note that your permanent location should be somewhere in Europe.</li><li>Currently, the number of kids from our team members outnumbers the number of employees.</li><li>We don’t only care about the kids “within” the company, but also about all children - for example, we compensate the carbon of all our flights.</li><li>As an international company, we want to create similar standards for everyone, regardless of location. So, additional perks (for example, a location-aware, fixed amount paid each month to cover costs like co-working, phone contracts or gym memberships), paid parental leave and healthcare compensation are compulsory.</li></ul>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>unlimited holidays</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>fair and transparent open salaries</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>familiy friendlyness is a must</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>choose the time you want to work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>choose the devices you want to work with</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>remote work possible</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Launched in the U.K. in December 2018, after 6 years operating in New Zealand, CoGo wants to transform every pound that U.K. consumers spend into a vote for a better future. The platform is the first tech innovation that has the aim of leveraging spending data and every transaction made by a consumer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><a href='https://cogo.co'><strong>CoGo</strong></a> has recently launched the world's first-ever &quot;ethical wallet share&quot;. We are the UK&rsquo;s national aggregator of data on accredited businesses and we are using this data, in conjunction with <a href='https://www.openbanking.org.uk/'><strong>Open Banking</strong></a>, to build a platform that can tell our users what percentage of their spending is with businesses that align with their values. This enables our core value proposition: a recommendation engine that helps our users shift more of their spending to ethical and sustainable businesses.</p><br /><h1><strong>ABOUT YOU:&nbsp;</strong></h1><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You are a clear-thinking, dynamic person who is equally happy bringing a strategic perspective to our operational scaling as getting your hands dirty keeping our books.&nbsp; You will thrive on a challenge and have initiative in spades. Your passion for keeping CoGo ship-shape will be infectious, and you&rsquo;ll have the vision and drive to position our finance and operations functions for growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We work collaboratively, so excellent relationship and communication skills are essential, but you&rsquo;ll also have plenty of autonomy and need to be happy working on your own. You&rsquo;ll enjoy working in a fast-paced, tech-savvy and entrepreneurial environment.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll contribute superb organisation and project management skills, and exemplary attention to detail &ndash; even under pressure.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll have a proven track record with 5 or more years experience across the full range of functions in your portfolio, but you don&rsquo;t need to be a chartered accountant (we have a Virtual Financial Controller for that).&nbsp; We use Xero, so it would be ideal if you&rsquo;re already familiar with it, but if not we&rsquo;ll support you to learn fast.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>CoGo is a values-driven business, and it&rsquo;s our commitment to a better future that drives each and every one of us. You&rsquo;ll love working with us if you care about people and the planet, and believe in the power of data, technology and consumer demand to bring about meaningful change.</p><br /><h1><strong>ABOUT THE ROLE:&nbsp;</strong></h1><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our CEO is looking for a strategic right hand to help run the day-to-day operations of the company - with a focus on the UK market but also supporting the NZ team.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><h2><strong>Operations</strong></h2><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Lead the recruitment strategy for new staff and contractors.

Quimbee authors must be masters at breaking difficult concepts down and saying them simply. In this capacity, you will serve as, in effect, a legal educator. This is a position of great trust and responsibility. You are on the front lines, charged with ensuring that nothing but the highest quality content reaches Quimbee’s students.</p><p>Quimbee is looking for legal academics with strong subject-matter expertise in immigration law to write a comprehensive outline, designed to help law students prepare for classes and final exams, in that subject.&nbsp;<strong>We are considering a full-time or part-time hire on a limited, contract basis</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>with a view toward possible future work at the outline project’s conclusion. Depending on the details, we estimate that this project will take between three and five months to complete.

This is basically “The Right-Hand of the CTO”, as I need help with everything from speccing new tasks, testing tasks, answer questions from developers and even conceptualize new features.\\n\\nYOU DON’T HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CODE. However, It’s expected you’re the rare unicorn that is both technically very strong but also very good at communications, user experience and understands the business side of things.\\n\\nWhat are we doing:\\nSince we launched Likvido in April 2018, we’ve absolutely nailed it. Not only do we now have 1.000+ customers - among many of the hottest startups and scaleups in Denmark - we also managed to get very serious funding, have very good unit economics and built a really cool technical platform. However, we’re just getting started.\\n\\nSo what are we doing?\\nWe are solving the biggest reason for companies going bankrupt in Europe. You see, 19 % of all invoices are paid late, and roughly half of all bankruptcies are caused by lack of cash.\\n\\nLikvido is defining a new category we’re calling a “customer payment system”. Today you integrate Likvido with your accounting system, and then we automate sending out invoices, send our reminders, start debt collection and post back to the accounting system. Looking ahead, we will add financial products, give the whole organization access to our system and much more. In brief, we help companies get paid - on time - and forecast their cash flow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n Your job responsibilities will be:\\n\\n- To maintain a high product quality, through both lots of testing of new features &amp; continuously improve everything we have live\\n- Ensure great performance by metrics such as: errors in logs, fast page-load, check request amounts\\n- Release management and making sure new code goes live (without problems)\\n- Help our CTO specify new tasks to our development team, and verify specification makes sense on all new tasks\\n- Help our development team with questions on features\\n- Be responsible for our internal IT support email\\n \\nTo make it concrete, during an average day, you could expect to do some of the following:\\n\\n- Testing a new feature made by a developer, and giving structured feedback (in Github)\\n- Checking website speed and amount of requests (in Azure)\\n- Testing a new release is ready to be rolled into production and then pulling the “release trigger!” (in Azure Devops)\\n- Reply to support tickets from our internal support department (in Intercom), and realize we have a bug, that you specify a solution for our development team (in Github)\\n- Help developers with questions about tasks (in Slack)\\n- Get a few hours to come up with some examples of how a new type of page could look (concept development) \\n\\n# Requirements\\nWe’re very open to your background, but the following is important to have in mind:\\n\\n- Fluent in English\\n- Some kind of formal education in business, economy, communication, IT or marketing is required\\n- You’re very detail oriented and structured\\n- You’re IT-savvy. You should be able to: 1) download development programs &amp; run applications from your computer 2) be open to learn SQL / databases if you don’t know it 3) use many different systems\\n- You have a Windows computer or are OK with installing Bootcamp and running Windows when you work. Parallels is not good enough\\n\\nA big part of the job is providing feedback to our developers by testing and speccing. It’s also extremely important that you’re able to quickly understand what we do, so you can help us improve the product. It’s a huge plus if you’ve worked with SaaS (software-as-a-service) before, or has worked in accounting systems.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that we’re a startup with big ambitions. This also come with big expectations. We don’t expect you to work crazy Silicon Valley hours, but you should also expect to work significantly more than 40 hours per work. \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

We are looking for a team-oriented, resourceful and self-motivated person to make an impact in a young, growing company.</p><p><strong>Job Purpose: Head of Finance</strong></p><p>Shield GEO provides outsourced employment and payroll for hundreds of employees in over 60 countries. Our Finance team is the engine that makes sure all our GEO employees get paid on time every month. The team collaborates closely with colleagues in Global Mobility, Subject Matter Experts and Implementation to ensure our clients have a great experience.</p><p>This is a broad reaching role as you’ll be responsible for the smooth operation and ongoing improvement of our three functions within finance. Our Operational team create invoices, process payments and generate payslips. Our SME team resolve issues and answer questions about international tax, payroll and finance. They also setup new GEO employees and process termination payrolls. And our Reporting team handle our internal payroll, company administration and reporting.</p><p>You’ll report directly to the company founders and be a key contributor to our leadership team. You’ll have plenty of support from your team leads, the operational and project teams, our systems and our technology platform. All employees at Shield have flexibility about when and where they work. Most of us choose to work remotely with flexible hours.</p><p><strong>Working with Shield</strong></p><p>If you are excited by the thought of playing an active role in a company that provides opportunities to create and innovate, you’re at the right place.</p><p>We’re a remote-friendly company with employees all around the world. We don’t want to be limited by location and are open to hiring anyone from anywhere as long as it’s a great fit for us and you. Before we get to know you, we’d like to give you a sense of who we are and what is important to us. We hope this helps you decide if you want to be a part of Shield GEO.</p><p>Every person is unique. At Shield GEO, we encourage an inclusive culture that embraces each individual’s differences. We believe that diversity of thought and experience is vital to generating creative ideas, developing effective strategies and making better decisions.</p><p>When hiring we do not discriminate by any unlawful means including, but not limited to, race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, age or veteran status.<br>We offer reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities wherever possible. Our employees are provided with the basic equipment required to give them a comfortable, safe and productive workplace. If you require additional equipment beyond our standard offering we are happy to work with you to try to find a solution.</p><p>We can’t quite show you what it’s like to work with us but you can hear from our employees themselves. Here’re some articles written by our Co-Founder, Customer Success Manager and Digital Marketing Manager.</p><ul><li>Working remotely and flexibly with Shield Geo</li><li>Leave policy</li><li>Work equipment policy</li><li>Workplace Diversity policy</li></ul><p><strong>Do you share our values?</strong></p><p>Our 4 values are integral to who we are. Our company culture is constantly evolving, every person who joins us adds something unique to our culture. But our values are shared by all Shield GEO employees. Do these values resonate with you?</p><p><strong>Grow</strong></p><p>We believe that personal growth and company growth go hand in hand. We look to foster our own growth and help grow the company. Every day is an opportunity to face a new challenge and get a little better. In our world of international employment it is impossible to know all the answers. Instead of trying to know everything, we focus on knowing how to solve problems. When mistakes happen we know it’s all part of the learning curve and we seek feedback to help us improve. We keep an eye on the big picture so we can identify improvements to processes and systems. As the problems become larger and more complex, it means that we’ll need more flexible and agile minds to come up with solutions.</p><p><strong>Own It</strong></p><p>We are self-motivated and love to see tasks to completion. Our managers and team mates are often in different time zones, and that’s ok! We aren’t afraid to step up when things get a little tough. We don’t like to micro-manage or <strong>be</strong> micromanaged. We trust our team mates to carry out their part of the process. We are responsible for our own workload and making sure we get our most important things done each day. If we get stuck we proactively seek help. And we show our reliability and accountability by keeping our systems updated. This also means our results can speak for themselves.</p><p><strong>Do The Right Thing</strong></p><p>Our clients trust us with compliance on their most important asset – their employees. This is a big responsibility! Doing the right thing means often times we choose a harder path and see it through to the end. It means we are open with our colleagues, clients and suppliers about bad news just the same as we share good news. And sometimes doing the right thing means we have to make decisions that will upset the very person we are trying to help. It’s a high standard but we stand by this very strongly. Doing the right thing also means considering how our actions impact those around us.</p><p><strong>Be Human</strong></p><p>We are a service business and helping people is at the core of everything we do. We pride ourselves on how we interact with colleagues, service providers and clients. We recognize that in all areas we’re dealing with real humans.</p><p>We know that working remotely and dealing with such a mix of people around the world is challenging. We know that if we are having trouble understanding someone, they are also struggling to understand us. Empathy is fundamental to helping us discover what people mean and how they are feeling. To avoid misinterpretation we assume best intent in others.</p><p>Because so much of our communication is written and asynchronous, we default to <em>over-communication</em>. This means we give extra details because we don’t leave people guessing. We make sure our words are clear and easy to understand. And we are kind to our fellow humans.</p><p><strong>Your Background</strong></p><ul><li>More than five years experience within Finance</li><li>More than five years experience in a leadership role</li><li>International tax or payroll experience required.

Drops is one of the top10 most innovative education companies according to FastCompany. Our app is in the Appstore for 3+ years, teaches 32 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times - App of the Year in 2018 on the Play Store - and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe (we have a small marketing crew in California) . We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Github and Monday. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 15 million, a monthly active of &gt;1,500,000 and an average store rating of 4.7.\\n\\nYou can find us here: http://drops.app.link/\\n\\n\\n**What’d be different here:\\n**\\n* We’re a small team. We’re optimising for impact, not for headcount. You’ll be carefully considering any tradeoff that would lead to increased complexity.\\n* We’re using a single programming language - TypeScript. We have strict linter rules. Every pull request needs to be approved before it lands in master. We use the rebase workflow.\\n* We’re using React to develop UI, on both mobile and the web.\\n* We’re doing things in a functional way, concentrating state, minimising side effects and making dependencies explicit. We’re sharing 98%+ of the code between Android, iOS and Web.\\n* We’re writing software with a web developer’s mindset.\\n* We automate where it has positive ROI.\\n* Our biggest challenge is (and will remain): managing the complexity of sharing a lot of code between different apps.\\n* We’re not building a hierarchy. We’re encouraging everyone to be autonomous. You’ll _not_ be an arbitrator between business and engineering. You’ll be helping both project owners and the tech team to work more closely together.\\n* Your average day will be about helping with team members make technical decision, adjusting processes as needed, doing research and automation, actually developing software and also, recruiting.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n * You’ll be responsible for the tech team’s effectiveness, well-being and development, and that its working aligns well to the business’ and our users’ needs.\\n* You’ll be making sure that the technical aspects of the projects are getting done on schedule, that we’re making the right trade-offs.\\n* You’ll be leading, mentoring, managing the people who are part of the tech team.\\n* You’ll be recruiting, onboarding top talent, sometimes. We’re a small team, and we’re not expecting to grow the headcount a lot (but we do expect to grow the impact each of us have!).\\n* You’ll be working closely together with the leadership team, to lay down the tracks for future product and infrastructural expansion.\\n* You’ll be in charge of flourishing our engineering culture - organise information sharing, hackathons, processes, developing new, helpful routines.\\n* We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and independency.\\n* You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT).\\n* We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary. \\n\\n# Requirements\\n* Can see a problem from the product, business’ and the team’s perspective.\\n* You have excellent technical and people skills. (yes, we know, it’s rare!)\\n* You are more of a frontend than a backend engineer. (we’re frontend heavy)\\n* You held senior software engineering management position such as CTO, Head of Development, or VP of Engineering positions in the past and enjoyed it.\\n* You have introspective tendencies, and you’re looking for a position where you can grow fast.\\n* You can represent the technology, infrastructure, and the engineering team at the executive level. \\n\\n#Location\\n- European timezones   <br>  </div> </div>",

Drops is one of the top10 most innovative education companies according to FastCompany. Our app is in the Appstore for 3+ years, teaches 32 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times – App of the Year in 2018 on the Play Store – and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe (we have a small marketing crew in California) . We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Github and Monday. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 15 million, a monthly active of &gt;1,500,000 and an average store rating of 4.7.</p><p>You can find us here: http://drops.app.link/</p><p><strong>Here’s what we’re currently after:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll be responsible for the tech team’s effectiveness, well-being and development, and that its working aligns well to the business’ and our users’ needs.</li><li>You’ll be making sure that the technical aspects of the projects are getting done on schedule, that we’re making the right trade-offs.</li><li>You’ll be leading, mentoring, managing the people who are part of the tech team.</li><li>You’ll be recruiting, onboarding top talent, sometimes. We’re a small team, and we’re not expecting to grow the headcount a lot (but we do expect to grow the impact each of us have!).</li><li>You’ll be working closely together with the leadership team, to lay down the tracks for future product and infrastructural expansion.</li><li>You’ll be in charge of flourishing our engineering culture – organise information sharing, hackathons, processes, developing new, helpful routines.</li><li>We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and independency.</li><li>You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM – 6PM GMT).</li><li>We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.</li></ul><p><strong>What’d be different here:</strong></p><ul><li>We’re a small team. We’re optimising for impact, not for headcount. You’ll be carefully considering any tradeoff that would lead to increased complexity.</li><li>We’re using a single programming language – TypeScript. We have strict linter rules. Every pull request needs to be approved before it lands in master. We use the rebase workflow.</li><li>We’re using React to develop UI, on both mobile and the web.</li><li>We’re doing things in a functional way, concentrating state, minimising side effects and making dependencies explicit. We’re sharing 98%+ of the code between Android, iOS and Web.</li><li>We’re writing software with a web developer’s mindset.</li><li>We automate where it has positive ROI.</li><li>Our biggest challenge is (and will remain): managing the complexity of sharing a lot of code between different apps.</li><li>We’re not building a hierarchy. We’re encouraging everyone to be autonomous. You’ll _not_ be an arbitrator between business and engineering. You’ll be helping both project owners and the tech team to work more closely together.</li><li>Your average day will be about helping with team members make technical decision, adjusting processes as needed, doing research and automation, actually developing software and also, recruiting.</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Can see a problem from the product, business’ and the team’s perspective.</li><li>You have excellent technical and people skills.

Drops is one of the top10 most innovative education companies according to FastCompany. Our app is in the Appstore for 3+ years, teaches 32 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times - App of the Year in 2018 on the Play Store - and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe (we have a small marketing crew in California) . We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Github and Monday. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 15 million, a monthly active of &gt;1,500,000 and an average store rating of 4.7.</div><div>You can find us here: <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fdrops.app.link%2F' rel='nofollow'>http://drops.app.link/</a></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Here’s what we’re currently after:</strong></div><ul><li>You’ll be responsible for the tech team’s effectiveness, well-being and development, and that its working aligns well to the business’ and our users’ needs.</li><li>You’ll be making sure that the technical aspects of the projects are getting done on schedule, that we’re making the right trade-offs.</li><li>You’ll be leading, mentoring, managing the people who are part of the tech team.</li><li>You’ll be recruiting, onboarding top talent, sometimes. We’re a small team, and we’re not expecting to grow the headcount a lot (but we do expect to grow the impact each of us have!).</li><li>You’ll be working closely together with the leadership team, to lay down the tracks for future product and infrastructural expansion.</li><li>You’ll be in charge of flourishing our engineering culture - organise information sharing, hackathons, processes, developing new, helpful routines.</li><li>We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and independency.</li><li>You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT).</li><li>We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Skills and experience You have:</strong></div><ul><li>Can see a problem from the product, business’ and the team’s perspective.</li><li>You have excellent technical and people skills. (yes, we know, it’s rare!)</li><li>You are more of a frontend than a backend engineer. (we’re frontend heavy)</li><li>You held senior software engineering management position such as CTO, Head of Development, or VP of Engineering positions in the past and enjoyed it.</li><li>You have introspective tendencies, and you’re looking for a position where you can grow fast.</li><li>You can represent the technology, infrastructure, and the engineering team at the executive level.</li></ul><div><br><br><br></div><div><strong>What’d be different here:</strong></div><ul><li>We’re a small team. We’re optimising for impact, not for headcount. You’ll be carefully considering any tradeoff that would lead to increased complexity.</li><li>We’re using a single programming language - TypeScript. We have strict linter rules. Every pull request needs to be approved before it lands in master. We use the rebase workflow.</li><li>We’re using React to develop UI, on both mobile and the web.</li><li>We’re doing things in a functional way, concentrating state, minimising side effects and making dependencies explicit. We’re sharing 98%+ of the code between Android, iOS and Web.</li><li>We’re writing software with a web developer’s mindset.</li><li>We automate where it has positive ROI.</li><li>Our biggest challenge is (and will remain): managing the complexity of sharing a lot of code between different apps.</li><li>We’re not building a hierarchy. We’re encouraging everyone to be autonomous. You’ll _not_ be an arbitrator between business and engineering. You’ll be helping both project owners and the tech team to work more closely together.</li><li>Your average day will be about helping with team members make technical decision, adjusting processes as needed, doing research and automation, actually developing software and also, recruiting.</li></ul><div><br><br><br></div><div><strong>We offer:</strong></div><ul><li> All the perks of remote working</li><li> An awesomely compact 19 person team</li><li> Yearly educational allowance</li><li> Fitness allowance</li><li> High-end Apple hardware and ergonomic accessories</li><li> 30 days of holiday per year (including Christmas and other holidays)</li><li>✈️ Quarterly team gathering somewhere in the world (Amsterdam, Iceland, Lisbon and Budapest were previous locations)<br><br><br></li></ul></div>",

CPA's focus on the tax preparation while franchisees and contractors take care of the initial sales. Happy Tax's&nbsp;technology and processes, gives customers a fresh new experience with none of the hassles traditionally associated with preparing their taxes, meeting them anytime, anywhere including house calls.&nbsp;\\nWhat You'll Do\\nYou will oversee our technology infrastructure, work on development and manage outside developers. We recently acquired a SaaS vendor for one of our platforms which we will be further integrating into our operations and making enhancements to. The SaaS is built on Heroku with JQuery, Rivets.js (soon to be React), Bootstrap, Node.js with Express framework&nbsp;and PostgreSQL. Knowledge of them is necessary for this role. Enhancements include OCR, intelligent routing and machine learning. &nbsp;\\nLocation?\\n* Your house or office. No exceptions.&nbsp; Remote position.\\n\\n\\nType of Employment\\n* Full-time\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities and Duties\\nHere is the list of skills we believe are necessary for this job. Most importantly, we are hiring based on careful balance of relevant experience, cultural fit, and motivation:\\n* Are organized and completes tasks timely without intervention\\n* Solve problems independently\\n* Improve processes and technology\\n* Has experience coding\\n\\n\\nQualifications and Skills\\n* Must be nimble and growth oriented. We are a growth company and we intend to accelerate that growth. No bureaucracy, if you like that, this isn't the place for you. Must have&nbsp;a make it happen attitude and get results. This is not a big corporation and does not operate like one, we go from idea to implementation in days or weeks, not months or years.\\n* A tech minded person who do it themselves,&nbsp;lead their team leads and collaborate with the c-level execs. As a startup, we'll need you to be able to get your hands dirty in designing and implementing processes while being able to be a leader yourself and work with our leadership team.\\n\\n\\nBenefits and Perks\\n* Competitive Pay: Willing to look at experienced people who use this as their &quot;in&quot; to the company, and can scale pay accordingly.\\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The salary is not all you will make. All team members are entitled to stock options and yearly bonuses. We are raising additional rounds of capital through multiple channels and we expect there to have liquidity in our shares in the very short term. At the end of tax season, we assess everyone's performance and give bonuses accordingly.\\n* Be Part Of A Happy Team: We see ourselves as a team of people who are working hard together to accomplish a specific mission (become the default tax preparation business opportunity for business owners and the go to tax prep service for consumers), in service of a larger purpose (create time for what matters). Yes, every company says they take culture seriously...and most are full of it. We don't just talk about our culture, and then ignore it in action--we live this mission every day, and we have a pretty awesome set of principles that we live by as a team, because this is the operating system for our tribe, and everyone in our company lives these principles).\\n* Freedom: Once you're established, you can work from home, work while you travel, make your own hours--we don't care. We only care that you produce the necessary results (that's one of our core values in fact).\\n* Make A Real Impact: We are a small start-up (still under 15 full time year round team members that scale drastically during tax season) and you will be a major part of our team, and help shape our growth. Not only that, you won't just impact the company, you'll impact the world. Taxes and entrepreneurship are two of the very best ways to influence other people and change the way they think--and you'll be helping to make them a reality.\\n* Fun &amp; Fast-Paced Work: We don't have boring days. Some are hectic, some are hard, some are incredibly rewarding...but they are never boring and never exactly the same. That's what happens when you're solving real problems for people.\\n* Meet Interesting People: You're not just working on any tax company. Our company is winning awards regularly for our growth and innovation. The people that are part of our team are truly a special bunch. You'll get to work hand in hand with some of the most amazing and experienced professionals in the space.\\n\\n  </div> </div>",
