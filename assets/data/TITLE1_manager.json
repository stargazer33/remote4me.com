We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 15 million, a monthly active of &gt;1,500,000 and an average store rating of 4.7.\\n\\nYou can find us here: http://drops.app.link/\\n\\n\\n**What’d be different here:\\n**\\n* We’re a small team. We’re optimising for impact, not for headcount. You’ll be carefully considering any tradeoff that would lead to increased complexity.\\n* We’re using a single programming language - TypeScript. We have strict linter rules. Every pull request needs to be approved before it lands in master. We use the rebase workflow.\\n* We’re using React to develop UI, on both mobile and the web.\\n* We’re doing things in a functional way, concentrating state, minimising side effects and making dependencies explicit. We’re sharing 98%+ of the code between Android, iOS and Web.\\n* We’re writing software with a web developer’s mindset.\\n* We automate where it has positive ROI.\\n* Our biggest challenge is (and will remain): managing the complexity of sharing a lot of code between different apps.\\n* We’re not building a hierarchy. We’re encouraging everyone to be autonomous. You’ll _not_ be an arbitrator between business and engineering. You’ll be helping both project owners and the tech team to work more closely together.\\n* Your average day will be about helping with team members make technical decision, adjusting processes as needed, doing research and automation, actually developing software and also, recruiting.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n * You’ll be responsible for the tech team’s effectiveness, well-being and development, and that its working aligns well to the business’ and our users’ needs.\\n* You’ll be making sure that the technical aspects of the projects are getting done on schedule, that we’re making the right trade-offs.\\n* You’ll be leading, mentoring, managing the people who are part of the tech team.\\n* You’ll be recruiting, onboarding top talent, sometimes. We’re a small team, and we’re not expecting to grow the headcount a lot (but we do expect to grow the impact each of us have!).\\n* You’ll be working closely together with the leadership team, to lay down the tracks for future product and infrastructural expansion.\\n* You’ll be in charge of flourishing our engineering culture - organise information sharing, hackathons, processes, developing new, helpful routines.\\n* We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and independency.\\n* You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT).\\n* We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary. \\n\\n# Requirements\\n* Can see a problem from the product, business’ and the team’s perspective.\\n* You have excellent technical and people skills. (yes, we know, it’s rare!)\\n* You are more of a frontend than a backend engineer. (we’re frontend heavy)\\n* You held senior software engineering management position such as CTO, Head of Development, or VP of Engineering positions in the past and enjoyed it.\\n* You have introspective tendencies, and you’re looking for a position where you can grow fast.\\n* You can represent the technology, infrastructure, and the engineering team at the executive level. \\n\\n#Location\\n- European timezones   <br>  </div> </div>",

Drops is one of the top10 most innovative education companies according to FastCompany. Our app is in the Appstore for 3+ years, teaches 32 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times – App of the Year in 2018 on the Play Store – and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe (we have a small marketing crew in California) . We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Github and Monday. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 15 million, a monthly active of &gt;1,500,000 and an average store rating of 4.7.</p><p>You can find us here: http://drops.app.link/</p><p><strong>Here’s what we’re currently after:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll be responsible for the tech team’s effectiveness, well-being and development, and that its working aligns well to the business’ and our users’ needs.</li><li>You’ll be making sure that the technical aspects of the projects are getting done on schedule, that we’re making the right trade-offs.</li><li>You’ll be leading, mentoring, managing the people who are part of the tech team.</li><li>You’ll be recruiting, onboarding top talent, sometimes. We’re a small team, and we’re not expecting to grow the headcount a lot (but we do expect to grow the impact each of us have!).</li><li>You’ll be working closely together with the leadership team, to lay down the tracks for future product and infrastructural expansion.</li><li>You’ll be in charge of flourishing our engineering culture – organise information sharing, hackathons, processes, developing new, helpful routines.</li><li>We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and independency.</li><li>You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM – 6PM GMT).</li><li>We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.</li></ul><p><strong>What’d be different here:</strong></p><ul><li>We’re a small team. We’re optimising for impact, not for headcount. You’ll be carefully considering any tradeoff that would lead to increased complexity.</li><li>We’re using a single programming language – TypeScript. We have strict linter rules. Every pull request needs to be approved before it lands in master. We use the rebase workflow.</li><li>We’re using React to develop UI, on both mobile and the web.</li><li>We’re doing things in a functional way, concentrating state, minimising side effects and making dependencies explicit. We’re sharing 98%+ of the code between Android, iOS and Web.</li><li>We’re writing software with a web developer’s mindset.</li><li>We automate where it has positive ROI.</li><li>Our biggest challenge is (and will remain): managing the complexity of sharing a lot of code between different apps.</li><li>We’re not building a hierarchy. We’re encouraging everyone to be autonomous. You’ll _not_ be an arbitrator between business and engineering. You’ll be helping both project owners and the tech team to work more closely together.</li><li>Your average day will be about helping with team members make technical decision, adjusting processes as needed, doing research and automation, actually developing software and also, recruiting.</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Can see a problem from the product, business’ and the team’s perspective.</li><li>You have excellent technical and people skills.

Drops is one of the top10 most innovative education companies according to FastCompany. Our app is in the Appstore for 3+ years, teaches 32 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times - App of the Year in 2018 on the Play Store - and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe (we have a small marketing crew in California) . We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Github and Monday. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 15 million, a monthly active of &gt;1,500,000 and an average store rating of 4.7.</div><div>You can find us here: <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fdrops.app.link%2F' rel='nofollow'>http://drops.app.link/</a></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Here’s what we’re currently after:</strong></div><ul><li>You’ll be responsible for the tech team’s effectiveness, well-being and development, and that its working aligns well to the business’ and our users’ needs.</li><li>You’ll be making sure that the technical aspects of the projects are getting done on schedule, that we’re making the right trade-offs.</li><li>You’ll be leading, mentoring, managing the people who are part of the tech team.</li><li>You’ll be recruiting, onboarding top talent, sometimes. We’re a small team, and we’re not expecting to grow the headcount a lot (but we do expect to grow the impact each of us have!).</li><li>You’ll be working closely together with the leadership team, to lay down the tracks for future product and infrastructural expansion.</li><li>You’ll be in charge of flourishing our engineering culture - organise information sharing, hackathons, processes, developing new, helpful routines.</li><li>We value clear and honest communication and transparency, it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success and independency.</li><li>You will be involved in both high and low level decision making and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT).</li><li>We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Skills and experience You have:</strong></div><ul><li>Can see a problem from the product, business’ and the team’s perspective.</li><li>You have excellent technical and people skills.

We use the rebase workflow.</li><li>We’re using React to develop UI, on both mobile and the web.</li><li>We’re doing things in a functional way, concentrating state, minimising side effects and making dependencies explicit.

CPA's focus on the tax preparation while franchisees and contractors take care of the initial sales. Happy Tax's&nbsp;technology and processes, gives customers a fresh new experience with none of the hassles traditionally associated with preparing their taxes, meeting them anytime, anywhere including house calls.&nbsp;\\nWhat You'll Do\\nYou will oversee our technology infrastructure, work on development and manage outside developers. We recently acquired a SaaS vendor for one of our platforms which we will be further integrating into our operations and making enhancements to. The SaaS is built on Heroku with JQuery, Rivets.js (soon to be React), Bootstrap, Node.js with Express framework&nbsp;and PostgreSQL. Knowledge of them is necessary for this role. Enhancements include OCR, intelligent routing and machine learning. &nbsp;\\nLocation?\\n* Your house or office. No exceptions.&nbsp; Remote position.\\n\\n\\nType of Employment\\n* Full-time\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities and Duties\\nHere is the list of skills we believe are necessary for this job. Most importantly, we are hiring based on careful balance of relevant experience, cultural fit, and motivation:\\n* Are organized and completes tasks timely without intervention\\n* Solve problems independently\\n* Improve processes and technology\\n* Has experience coding\\n\\n\\nQualifications and Skills\\n* Must be nimble and growth oriented. We are a growth company and we intend to accelerate that growth. No bureaucracy, if you like that, this isn't the place for you. Must have&nbsp;a make it happen attitude and get results. This is not a big corporation and does not operate like one, we go from idea to implementation in days or weeks, not months or years.\\n* A tech minded person who do it themselves,&nbsp;lead their team leads and collaborate with the c-level execs. As a startup, we'll need you to be able to get your hands dirty in designing and implementing processes while being able to be a leader yourself and work with our leadership team.\\n\\n\\nBenefits and Perks\\n* Competitive Pay: Willing to look at experienced people who use this as their &quot;in&quot; to the company, and can scale pay accordingly.\\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The salary is not all you will make. All team members are entitled to stock options and yearly bonuses. We are raising additional rounds of capital through multiple channels and we expect there to have liquidity in our shares in the very short term. At the end of tax season, we assess everyone's performance and give bonuses accordingly.\\n* Be Part Of A Happy Team: We see ourselves as a team of people who are working hard together to accomplish a specific mission (become the default tax preparation business opportunity for business owners and the go to tax prep service for consumers), in service of a larger purpose (create time for what matters). Yes, every company says they take culture seriously...and most are full of it. We don't just talk about our culture, and then ignore it in action--we live this mission every day, and we have a pretty awesome set of principles that we live by as a team, because this is the operating system for our tribe, and everyone in our company lives these principles).\\n* Freedom: Once you're established, you can work from home, work while you travel, make your own hours--we don't care. We only care that you produce the necessary results (that's one of our core values in fact).\\n* Make A Real Impact: We are a small start-up (still under 15 full time year round team members that scale drastically during tax season) and you will be a major part of our team, and help shape our growth. Not only that, you won't just impact the company, you'll impact the world. Taxes and entrepreneurship are two of the very best ways to influence other people and change the way they think--and you'll be helping to make them a reality.\\n* Fun &amp; Fast-Paced Work: We don't have boring days. Some are hectic, some are hard, some are incredibly rewarding...but they are never boring and never exactly the same. That's what happens when you're solving real problems for people.\\n* Meet Interesting People: You're not just working on any tax company. Our company is winning awards regularly for our growth and innovation. The people that are part of our team are truly a special bunch. You'll get to work hand in hand with some of the most amazing and experienced professionals in the space.\\n\\n  </div> </div>",

This is a pivotal hire for us. Today, we are a flat team of 10 with everyone reporting to the co-founder and CEO. In the GM role, you will help to shape our organizational and communication structures and build out the next stage of the company. Our flat structure was initially a strength but is now a limiting factor to our growth. With your help, we will grow into a &quot;team of teams&quot; that is better equipped for future growth.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>At Tortuga, we are building a remote, humane workplace. That’s how we think work should work. As the General Manager, you will influence that vision while helping your teammates do great work.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Tortuga is comprised of Players and Coaches. Individual contributors (ICs) are Players and “managers” are Coaches. This analogy would make you the Head Coach. Longer-term, as we develop teams within the company, you will become a Coach of Coaches.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>A Coach’s role is to support Players, not to tell them what to do. You are not responsible for solving every problem. You are responsible for helping Players solve their own problems and for removing roadblocks so that Players can do their jobs well. You will enable Players to spend their time in deep work, not in meetings and administrative hell.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Tortuga is and will remain a Player-first company with a low Coach-to-Player ratio.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your experience should include growing a company or line of business from 7 to 8 figures in revenue and having managed a team of 10+ people (not necessarily all direct reports).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>The GM will work directly with Fred Perrotta, the co-founder and CEO of Tortuga.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>===</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Tortuga is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and encourage anyone who is interested in joining our team to apply for open roles, even if you aren't certain that you're qualified. For example, research shows that women are less likely to apply for roles if they don’t meet 100% of the qualifications.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Our top priority is hiring the right person for each role at Tortuga. So we want to hear from you.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>===</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>MISSION</b></div><div>To lead Tortuga as the Head Coach. You will work closely with each team member and alongside Fred, the co-founder and CEO, to execute on our strategy. You will make the team greater than the sum of its parts.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>OBJECTIVES</b></div><ul><li>Grow Tortuga from 7 to 8 figures in sales while remaining bootstrapped</li><li>Meet or exceed forecasted sales while staying under budget</li><li>Build the next iteration (V4) of the company as we transition from a flat, siloed structure to a more scalable &quot;team of teams&quot;</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>STRENGTHS</b></div><ul><li><b>Coaching</b>: You empower others to be great at their roles. You are a Coach, not a manager. Coaches don’t solve problems; they help Players solve problems. Tortuga is a Player-first company.</li><li><b>The Right Ambition</b>: The right ambition is ambition for the company, not for yourself. If Tortuga does well, you will do well. The opposite is not necessarily true. You should be able to work towards a common, company-wide goal even when you disagree with the strategy. Doing what is best for Tortuga and our customers is more important than getting your way.</li><li><b>Taking Initiative</b>: Every company says that it wants to hire self-starters. Remote companies have no choice. You must take initiative and hold yourself accountable to a high standard of work. No one is looking over your shoulder or tracking every minute of your work. You will likely have more autonomy at Tortuga than at your previous jobs. If you can’t turn this freedom into results, you won’t be successful on a remote team.</li><li><b>Written Communication</b>: Everyone on a remote team must be a strong writer. We have video calls and team retreats but communicate far more often in writing (Docs, Asana, email, Slack). You must be able to communicate clearly and concisely in writing.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>DO NOT APPLY IF...</b></div><ul><li>You aren’t excited about travel. Our team is passionate about the problems we work on every day and our mission of making travel easier and more enjoyable.</li><li>You want to spend your day in deep work. Coaches will have a manager's schedule, not a maker’s schedule.</li><li>You need the structure of working at a big company. We are a small, remote team. There is no HR department. If you need something done, you do it.</li><li>You need the credit. We’ve built a humble, “no ego” team and only intend to hire people who fit that mold.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></div><div>You must be based in a North America-friendly time zone as nine tenths of our team is based in the US and Canada.</div><div><br></div><div><b>BENEFITS</b></div><ul><li><b>Salary</b>: Base pay is $140,000. At Tortuga, salaries are calculated by a formula, not by negotiation. The formula includes base pay with multipliers for job level and tenure (at Tortuga).</li><li><b>Work from Anywhere</b>: Tortuga is 100% distributed. Decide where you work best, whether that's from home, a coffee shop, a co-working space, or another country. We will even pay for your coworking membership.</li><li><b>Team Retreats</b>: Twice per year, we meet up to plan the future and to enjoy time together in person. Past retreats include Prague, New Orleans, Lisbon, and Montreal.</li><li><b>Unlimited Vacation</b>: You decide how much of a break you need and when. Just promise to tell us about your trip when you get back.</li><li><b>Total Coverage</b>: Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision insurance. We pay 100% of your premiums and 50% of your dependents' premiums.</li><li><b>Retirement Savings</b>: Tortuga matches 100% of your contributions up to 4% of your salary.</li><li><b>Parental Leave</b>: Take up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave.</li><li><b>Free Gear</b>: All the bags and accessories you need for your future travels.</li></ul></div>",

This is a pivotal hire for us. Today, we are a flat team of 10 with everyone reporting to the co-founder and CEO. In the GM role, you will help to shape our organizational and communication structures and build out the next stage of the company. Our flat structure was initially a strength but is now a limiting factor to our growth. With your help, we will grow into a “team of teams” that is better equipped for future growth.</p><p><strong>At Tortuga, we are building a remote, humane workplace.</strong>&nbsp;That’s how we think work should work. As the General Manager, you will influence that vision while helping your teammates do great work.</p><p>Tortuga is comprised of Players and Coaches. Individual contributors (ICs) are Players and “managers” are Coaches. This analogy would make you the Head Coach. Longer-term, as we develop teams within the company, you will become a Coach of Coaches.</p><p>A Coach’s role is to&nbsp;<em>support</em>&nbsp;Players, not to tell them what to do. You are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;responsible for solving every problem. You&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;responsible for helping Players solve their own problems and for removing roadblocks so that Players can do their jobs well. You will enable Players to spend their time in deep work, not in meetings and administrative hell.</p><p>Tortuga is and will remain a Player-first company with a low Coach-to-Player ratio.</p><p>Your experience should include growing a company or line of business from 7 to 8 figures in revenue and having managed a team of 10+ people (not necessarily all direct reports).</p><p>The GM will work directly with the co-founder and CEO of Tortuga.</p><p>—</p><p>Tortuga is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and encourage anyone who is interested in joining our team to apply for open roles, even if you aren’t&nbsp;<em>certain</em>&nbsp;that you’re qualified. For example, research shows that women are less likely to apply for roles if they don’t meet 100% of the qualifications.</p><p>Our top priority is hiring the right person for each role at Tortuga. So we want to hear from you.</p><p><strong>Mission</strong></p><p>To lead Tortuga as the Head Coach. You will work closely with each team member and alongside Fred, the co-founder and CEO, to execute on our strategy. You will make the team greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p><strong>Objectives</strong></p><ul><li>Grow Tortuga from 7 to 8 figures in sales while remaining bootstrapped</li><li>Meet or exceed forecasted sales while staying under budget</li><li>Build the next iteration (V4) of the company as we transition from a flat, siloed structure to a more scalable “team of teams”</li></ul><p><strong>Strengths</strong></p><ul><li>Coaching: You empower others to be great at their roles. You are a Coach, not a manager. Coaches don’t solve problems; they help Players solve problems. Tortuga is a Player-first company.</li><li>The Right Ambition: The right ambition is ambition for the company, not for yourself. If Tortuga does well, you will do well. The opposite is not necessarily true. You should be able to work towards a common, company-wide goal even when you disagree with the strategy. Doing what is best for Tortuga and our customers is more important than getting your way.</li><li>Taking Initiative: Every company says that it wants to hire self-starters. Remote companies have no choice. You must take initiative and hold yourself accountable to a high standard of work. No one is looking over your shoulder or tracking every minute of your work. You will likely have more autonomy at Tortuga than at your previous jobs. If you can’t turn this freedom into results, you won’t be successful on a remote team.</li><li>Written Communication: Everyone on a remote team must be a strong writer. We have video calls and team retreats but communicate far more often in writing (Docs, Asana, email, Slack). You must be able to communicate clearly and concisely in writing.</li></ul><p><strong>Do Not Apply If…</strong></p><ul><li>You aren’t excited about travel. Our team is passionate about the problems we work on every day and our mission of making travel easier and more enjoyable.</li><li>You want to spend your day in deep work. Coaches will have a manager’s schedule, not a maker’s schedule.</li><li>You need the structure of working at a big company. We are a small, remote team. There is no HR department. If&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>need something done,&nbsp;<em>you&nbsp;</em>do it.</li><li>You need the credit. We’ve built a humble, “no ego” team and only intend to hire people who fit that mold.</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li><strong>You must be based in a North America-friendly time zone as nine tenths of our team is based in the US and Canada.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p><strong>Salary: Base pay is $140,000</strong>. At Tortuga, salaries are calculated by a formula, not by negotiation. The formula includes base pay with multipliers for job level and tenure (at Tortuga).</p><ul><li><strong>Work from Anywhere: Tortuga is 100% distributed.</strong>&nbsp;Decide where you work best, whether that’s from home, a coffee shop, a co-working space, or another country. We will even pay for your coworking membership.</li><li><strong>Team Retreats: Twice per year, we meet up to plan the future and to enjoy time together in person. Past retreats include Prague, New Orleans, Lisbon, and Montreal.</strong></li><li>Unlimited Vacation: You decide how much of a break you need and when. Just promise to tell us about your trip when you get back.</li><li>Total Coverage: Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision insurance. We pay 100% of your premiums and 50% of your dependents’ premiums.</li><li>Retirement Savings: Tortuga matches 100% of your contributions up to 4% of your salary.</li><li>Parental Leave: Take up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave.</li><li>Free Gear: All the bags and accessories you need for your future travels.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://tortuga.workable.com/j/ED58E796BB' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Our programs span hundreds of after-school clubs, dozens of student-led hackathons, a vibrant online Slack community with thousands of students, and a fiscal sponsorship (<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship</a>) program that recently crossed $700K in transactions and frontpaged Hacker News a few months ago (<a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19257241' rel='nofollow'>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19257241</a>).</p><p>We’re looking to bring in a Director of Club Operations to systematize and grow our primary program: clubs. You will own the end-to-end club experience, including processes to deliver high-quality mentorship to hundreds of club leaders worldwide, enabling Hack Club to scale beyond the number of calls our team can take in a week. If successful, this position will bring Hack Club from 2% of US high schools to becoming as ubiquitous and culturally foundational as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.</p><p>This role has C-level freedom, as well as responsibility. You will be tasked with solving the most challenging problems Hack Club faces as a rapidly growing student network. You must be able to work creatively and autonomously to design life-changing student experiences that you can simultaneously maintain and deliver to an ever-growing number of students.</p><p>Some examples of challenges to overcome:</p><p>- How do we build a diverse and representative community of student leaders and enable leaders to do the same within their clubs?- How do we offer consistent value to students regardless of their financial background, making the club experience as powerful in Zimbabwe as it is in Cincinnati?- How do we provide high-quality mentorship and coaching to a large body of student leaders, and bring students into the process of onboarding other clubs?- How do we ensure that clubs survive the graduation of their leaders?</p><p>We need an obsessive, product-minded, operationally-excellent person with past experience growing direct-service programs and an intense focus on the student experience.</p><p>Interested? Email me at zach@hackclub.com with why you think you’d be a good fit for this role.</p>",

We’ve been working steadily to engage campuses since 2012. In 2018 we provided materials and resources to 439 college campuses with a total enrollment of 4.7 million students.</p>\n <p>For most of our target states, local state directors lead nonpartisan electoral engagement outreach activities, primarily by building and maintaining partnerships with faculty, staff, administrators and students on college campuses. We also reach schools through partner organizations in states where we don’t have directors and through individual schools that inquire about getting CEEP support. We’ve developed useful resources for schools throughout the country, from specific engagement approaches to our nonpartisan candidate guides. Our <strong>At-Large Director </strong>would use these resources to guide schools in states where we don’t have existing directors toward effective electoral engagement.</p>\n <p>Working across these states, the <strong>At-Large Director </strong>will utilize email, webinars, and more limited direct phone outreach to larger schools. The Director will help schools work with key allies such as Campus Compact affiliates to gain access to the schools, and connect them with individual interested campuses.</p>\n <p>The ideal candidate will have a proven ability to foster strong relationships and stay organized while working on long-term projects. Because this is a new position, you’ll be committed both to developing new ideas and promoting established models of engagement, while handling various points of contact with administrators, faculty and student government leaders.</p>\n <p><strong>This is a remote, contracted position with an hourly wage. </strong>Being a motivated self-starter is a must. <strong>Candidates can be located anywhere in the US.</strong> CEEP is a nonpartisan organization and candidates need to be committed to nonpartisanship and to helping engage all students on the campuses they work with.</p>\n <p><strong>Job Responsibilities:</strong></p>\n <p>The <strong>At-Large Director </strong>reports to the Associate and National Directors and is responsible for the following:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Recruit and manage campus contacts, and work with them to assess the state of their engagement and use our resources and approaches to help them increase it.</li>\n  <li>Respond to interest from individual schools and reach out to major individual schools in states where CEEP isn’t already working.</li>\n  <li>Work with partners like the Compact affiliates to find ways to bring CEEP resources and approaches to their members. Reach out in collaboration with affiliates to help major individual schools increase their engagement efforts.</li>\n  <li>Possibly manage a limited number of student Fellows.</li>\n  <li>Learn where to refer schools on matters of state voter registration, absentee and early voting.</li>\n  <li>Manage data collection of outreach, including contacts, resources distributed, and support provided to schools.</li>\n  <li>Participate in weekly check-ins with the Director or Associate Director. Complete internal projects and tasks.</li>\n  <li>Stay self-organized, submitting reports and projects in a timely manner.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>\n <p>We’re seeking candidates who excel in relationship building, are results-oriented, and have strong project management and self-management skills. You should have:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>A bachelor’s degree. </strong></li>\n  <li>A track record of developing and maintaining strong working relationships with diverse stakeholders.</li>\n  <li>Strong written and oral communication skills.</li>\n  <li><strong>Self-motivation, persistence, and the ability to excel in a remote work environment. </strong></li>\n  <li>Comfort in developing new initiatives and building some of the road as you travel. You’ll be figuring out ways to engage large numbers of campuses that we haven’t previously worked with, helping them use campus election engagement resources honed through our nearly 10 years in the field.</li>\n  <li>Experience managing multiple projects.</li>\n  <li>Commitment to the CEEP mission and vision of nonpartisan engagement.</li>\n  <li>Ability to prioritize schools and levels of engagement with them. Knowledge of voter outreach practices and experience in campaign or higher education environments are both plusses but are not requirements.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Salary and Location: </strong></p>\n <p><strong>This is a contract position</strong> reporting to CEEP’s National Director. <strong>Hourly fee based on experience (between $22 and $28 per hour). We do not currently offer benefits. This is an opportunity to work full-time from your location with a fantastic team of staff on the critical mission of getting students involved in democracy. </strong></p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://campuselect.org/about-ceep/at-large-director-job-opening/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

I want them to finish each article feeling empowered, knowing what their next steps are to find the guidance they are searching for.</p>\n  <p>Since it's primarily a Tarot website, I think it is important to reference Tarot cards in each of the articles. It would also be good to link to other relevant (internal) articles, to tie everything together.</p>\n  <p>For example, if you were writing an article on &quot;What is the Law of Attraction (and the exact steps to follow to manifest something into your life)&quot; it would be good to talk about a few Tarot cards that represent manifestation.</p>\n  <p>The articles will be created weekly, and I think the target should be 1,500 - 2,000 words. There's a lot of freedom here, so hopefully this topic interests you.</p>\n  <p>This is a long term project, and if it goes well we can expand it to 2 or 3 articles a week (if you have time) or keep it at 1. There is a huge amount of content to create but I am very flexible.</p>\n  <p><strong>What I am looking for</strong></p>\n  <p>For me, the most important thing is working with a writer that gets things done and doesn't come up with excuses. Having experience with Tarot cards is a plus, but if you're willing to learn I am willing to teach you. A background in SEO is also useful, since one of the secondary goals is to have the articles rank for important keywords.</p>\n  <p>I'm not fussed on education, etc., but your ability to write native english is critical. Also, I really like clear and concise language - I hate it when people are needlessly wordy to fill up space, and to make themselves sound smarter than they actually are :)</p>\n  <p>I also want to listen to you, and do what I can to make this work and fun and enjoyable for you. I want to work with you for YEARS, so let me know what you need and I will do my best to make it happen.</p>\n  <p>If you have a daily rate I can book you for one day a week, or if you prefer the word count way that can work too.</p>\n  <p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p>\n  <p>1) Please share the best article you've ever written, and briefly tell me why it's the best</p>\n  <p>2) Please let me know why you are applying to this job specifically.</p>\n  <p>3) Briefly talk about your background, and why you think it's relevant to where you are now (and this project)</p>\n  <p>4) I want to work with great writers, so the rate is 100% negotiable. Let me know what you think is fair compensation for your services and I will pay it.</p>\n  <p>5) I am going to be hiring several writers as a test, and then awarding the permanent job to the article I like the most. The topic will be &quot;the Law of Attraction&quot;, so let me know what you would include in that article and why. (Note: I am not trying to get you to write a free article. The purpose of the question is to better understand your process, with a relevant example. I will pay you to write the full article you suggest at your full rate if I think we're on the same page.)</p>\n  <p>6) I would love to see your twitter/instagram/blog/work history. etc. so feel free to share whatever you want and I'll take a look at it.</p>\n  <p>Please email your application to hireme (at) jeremydavid (.) com</p>\n  <p>Thank you!</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

Machines are increasingly awesome at understanding English, but what about the 5+ billion people who need to communicate in their native language?</p>\n <p>Sinitic automates multilingual customer support with a vertically-integrated product suite and proprietary Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine for Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai and other languages. Our core tech includes IP for mixed-language understanding and semi-supervised chat history structuring (we really love NLP). We’re a fast-growing SaaS business with great call center clients from the iGaming and RegTech industries.</p>\n <p><strong>HOW WE WORK</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Build fast with usage:</strong>&nbsp;We deploy functional product and iterate fast with real-time usage. With this approach, Sinitic rapidly implements cutting-edge NLP tech.</p>\n <p><strong>Lead first into frontiers:&nbsp;</strong>We target customer segments in underserved markets around the world. With this curiosity, Sinitic ventures first where others overlook.</p>\n <p><strong>Stay Hyper-Global:</strong>&nbsp;We’re a team with Ukrainian devs building Canadian software powered by Thai NLP for Swedish clients based in the Philippines.</p>\n <p><strong>OUR TECH &amp; ROADMAP</strong></p>\n <p>The backbone of Sinitic consists of several python (micro) services communicating through a message queue server. Our clients have call centers with 24/7 operations, therefore testing and high-availability are critical to us. We are currently hosted on a multi-region GCP infrastructure and rely heavily on Kubernetes and Google Cloud SQL (Postgres) to achieve high levels of stability and performance.</p>\n <p>The heart of Sinitic is driven by our passion to ensure that the conversational AI revolution benefits everyone from all corners of the Earth. To do this, we’re building automation products that go after every mundane task in the customer support domain: livechat, ticketing, chatbot training, upselling, scheduling, and more.</p>\n <p><strong>DO YOUR BEST WORK, FROM ANYWHERE</strong><br>As a remote-first company, our top priority is to implement new ways of enabling your maximum productivity, happiness, and contributions to the team. To accomplish this, we receive incredible support from the Creative Destruction Lab, Next Canada, Ontario Centers of Excellence, the National Research Council of Canada and GCI Ventures. We’re building a team of ambitious, global-minded, can-do winners who want to absolutely succeed over the next years. Together, we’re doing the finest work of our lives.</p>\n <p><strong>ABOUT THE ROLE</strong></p>\n <p>The Director of Accounts leads a multinational team with personnel interchanging between two broad roles: account executives (who discover new business) and account managers (who implement and grow existing business). Sinitic is a scaling startup focused on niche industries where personal, cross-cultural relationships are crucial to growing revenue. As such, the Accounts department is structured to compete&nbsp;<strong>assymetrically</strong>&nbsp;with no pronouced division between pre/post sales, and instead applies the most suited team member(s) to accounts in order to build excellent relationships across all cultures and languages. At its core, this role is about strategically multiplying the department’s human resources in order to punch above its weight globally, and win then grow key accounts. This role is not about quotas, hard-pitching, and the linear processes of traditional software sales departments.</p>\n <p><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>General Experience</strong>: 10+ years in business development and key account management for software development firms.</li>\n  <li><strong>Industry Experience</strong>: Extensive knowledge of the iGaming industry with relationships spanning Philippines, Malta, Gibraltar, UK, and/or Cost Rica.</li>\n  <li><strong>Assymetric Thinker</strong>: Ability to adopt prinicples of “force multiplication” to compete globally with minimal resources.</li>\n  <li><strong>Team Leader:&nbsp;</strong>Support a distributed team of account executives and managers from prospecting to upselling.</li>\n  <li><strong>People Developer:&nbsp;</strong>Effective at developing your team members’ sales and implementation skills so they are comfortable interchanging between roles as required.</li>\n  <li><strong>Product Expert:&nbsp;</strong>Demonstrate natural ability to understand and present a complex B2B SaaS product suite.</li>\n  <li><strong>Great Listener:&nbsp;</strong>Act as the “voice of the clients” in all management and product meetings.</li>\n  <li><strong>Relationship Builder:</strong>&nbsp;Go the extra mile to build lasting relationships with potential and existing clients.</li>\n  <li><strong>Flair for Marketing:</strong>&nbsp;Identify case studies and competitive advantages to pass onto the marketing team.</li>\n  <li><strong>Truly Global:&nbsp;</strong>Personify the company’s global mission with a progressive and multicultural background.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cool Cookie:</strong>&nbsp;This is a startup. We plan ahead but must be nimble and fast to adapt. If we asked your friends, they would say you’re the calmest person they know in tough situations.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>NICE TO HAVES (BUT NOT DEALBREAKERS)</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Knowledge of iGaming contact center operations</li>\n  <li>Multilingual</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>COMPENSATION &amp; BENEFITS</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Above market salary</li>\n  <li>Competitive commission</li>\n  <li>20 vacation days</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Sinitic is committed to equality of opportunity for all team members.
