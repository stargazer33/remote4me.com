    "content": "<h3> General Manager </h3><div><div><span>Tortuga is seeking a General Manager (GM) to help us make travel easier and more enjoyable.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>As GM, you will be the first non-founder people manager at the company. This is a pivotal hire for us. Today, we are a flat team of 10 with everyone reporting to the co-founder and CEO. In the GM role, you will help to shape our organizational and communication structures and build out the next stage of the company. Our flat structure was initially a strength but is now a limiting factor to our growth. With your help, we will grow into a &quot;team of teams&quot; that is better equipped for future growth.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>At Tortuga, we are building a remote, humane workplace. That’s how we think work should work. As the General Manager, you will influence that vision while helping your teammates do great work.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Tortuga is comprised of Players and Coaches. Individual contributors (ICs) are Players and “managers” are Coaches. This analogy would make you the Head Coach. Longer-term, as we develop teams within the company, you will become a Coach of Coaches.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>A Coach’s role is to support Players, not to tell them what to do. You are not responsible for solving every problem. You are responsible for helping Players solve their own problems and for removing roadblocks so that Players can do their jobs well. You will enable Players to spend their time in deep work, not in meetings and administrative hell.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Tortuga is and will remain a Player-first company with a low Coach-to-Player ratio.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your experience should include growing a company or line of business from 7 to 8 figures in revenue and having managed a team of 10+ people (not necessarily all direct reports).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>The GM will work directly with Fred Perrotta, the co-founder and CEO of Tortuga.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>===</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Tortuga is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and encourage anyone who is interested in joining our team to apply for open roles, even if you aren't certain that you're qualified. For example, research shows that women are less likely to apply for roles if they don’t meet 100% of the qualifications.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Our top priority is hiring the right person for each role at Tortuga. So we want to hear from you.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>===</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>MISSION</b></div><div>To lead Tortuga as the Head Coach. You will work closely with each team member and alongside Fred, the co-founder and CEO, to execute on our strategy. You will make the team greater than the sum of its parts.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>OBJECTIVES</b></div><ul><li>Grow Tortuga from 7 to 8 figures in sales while remaining bootstrapped</li><li>Meet or exceed forecasted sales while staying under budget</li><li>Build the next iteration (V4) of the company as we transition from a flat, siloed structure to a more scalable &quot;team of teams&quot;</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>STRENGTHS</b></div><ul><li><b>Coaching</b>: You empower others to be great at their roles. You are a Coach, not a manager. Coaches don’t solve problems; they help Players solve problems. Tortuga is a Player-first company.</li><li><b>The Right Ambition</b>: The right ambition is ambition for the company, not for yourself. If Tortuga does well, you will do well. The opposite is not necessarily true. You should be able to work towards a common, company-wide goal even when you disagree with the strategy. Doing what is best for Tortuga and our customers is more important than getting your way.</li><li><b>Taking Initiative</b>: Every company says that it wants to hire self-starters. Remote companies have no choice. You must take initiative and hold yourself accountable to a high standard of work. No one is looking over your shoulder or tracking every minute of your work. You will likely have more autonomy at Tortuga than at your previous jobs. If you can’t turn this freedom into results, you won’t be successful on a remote team.</li><li><b>Written Communication</b>: Everyone on a remote team must be a strong writer. We have video calls and team retreats but communicate far more often in writing (Docs, Asana, email, Slack). You must be able to communicate clearly and concisely in writing.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>DO NOT APPLY IF...</b></div><ul><li>You aren’t excited about travel. Our team is passionate about the problems we work on every day and our mission of making travel easier and more enjoyable.</li><li>You want to spend your day in deep work. Coaches will have a manager's schedule, not a maker’s schedule.</li><li>You need the structure of working at a big company. We are a small, remote team. There is no HR department. If you need something done, you do it.</li><li>You need the credit. We’ve built a humble, “no ego” team and only intend to hire people who fit that mold.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></div><div>You must be based in a North America-friendly time zone as nine tenths of our team is based in the US and Canada.</div><div><br></div><div><b>BENEFITS</b></div><ul><li><b>Salary</b>: Base pay is $140,000. At Tortuga, salaries are calculated by a formula, not by negotiation. The formula includes base pay with multipliers for job level and tenure (at Tortuga).</li><li><b>Work from Anywhere</b>: Tortuga is 100% distributed. Decide where you work best, whether that's from home, a coffee shop, a co-working space, or another country. We will even pay for your coworking membership.</li><li><b>Team Retreats</b>: Twice per year, we meet up to plan the future and to enjoy time together in person. Past retreats include Prague, New Orleans, Lisbon, and Montreal.</li><li><b>Unlimited Vacation</b>: You decide how much of a break you need and when. Just promise to tell us about your trip when you get back.</li><li><b>Total Coverage</b>: Comprehensive medical, dental, and vision insurance. We pay 100% of your premiums and 50% of your dependents' premiums.</li><li><b>Retirement Savings</b>: Tortuga matches 100% of your contributions up to 4% of your salary.</li><li><b>Parental Leave</b>: Take up to 12 weeks of paid parental leave.</li><li><b>Free Gear</b>: All the bags and accessories you need for your future travels.</li></ul></div>",

This is a pivotal hire for us. Today, we are a flat team of 10 with everyone reporting to the co-founder and CEO. In the GM role, you will help to shape our organizational and communication structures and build out the next stage of the company. Our flat structure was initially a strength but is now a limiting factor to our growth. With your help, we will grow into a “team of teams” that is better equipped for future growth.</p><p><strong>At Tortuga, we are building a remote, humane workplace.</strong>&nbsp;That’s how we think work should work. As the General Manager, you will influence that vision while helping your teammates do great work.</p><p>Tortuga is comprised of Players and Coaches. Individual contributors (ICs) are Players and “managers” are Coaches. This analogy would make you the Head Coach. Longer-term, as we develop teams within the company, you will become a Coach of Coaches.</p><p>A Coach’s role is to&nbsp;<em>support</em>&nbsp;Players, not to tell them what to do. You are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;responsible for solving every problem. You&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;responsible for helping Players solve their own problems and for removing roadblocks so that Players can do their jobs well. You will enable Players to spend their time in deep work, not in meetings and administrative hell.</p><p>Tortuga is and will remain a Player-first company with a low Coach-to-Player ratio.</p><p>Your experience should include growing a company or line of business from 7 to 8 figures in revenue and having managed a team of 10+ people (not necessarily all direct reports).</p><p>The GM will work directly with the co-founder and CEO of Tortuga.</p><p>—</p><p>Tortuga is an equal opportunity employer. We value diversity and encourage anyone who is interested in joining our team to apply for open roles, even if you aren’t&nbsp;<em>certain</em>&nbsp;that you’re qualified. For example, research shows that women are less likely to apply for roles if they don’t meet 100% of the qualifications.</p><p>Our top priority is hiring the right person for each role at Tortuga. So we want to hear from you.</p><p><strong>Mission</strong></p><p>To lead Tortuga as the Head Coach. You will work closely with each team member and alongside Fred, the co-founder and CEO, to execute on our strategy. You will make the team greater than the sum of its parts.</p><p><strong>Objectives</strong></p><ul><li>Grow Tortuga from 7 to 8 figures in sales while remaining bootstrapped</li><li>Meet or exceed forecasted sales while staying under budget</li><li>Build the next iteration (V4) of the company as we transition from a flat, siloed structure to a more scalable “team of teams”</li></ul><p><strong>Strengths</strong></p><ul><li>Coaching: You empower others to be great at their roles. You are a Coach, not a manager. Coaches don’t solve problems; they help Players solve problems. Tortuga is a Player-first company.</li><li>The Right Ambition: The right ambition is ambition for the company, not for yourself. If Tortuga does well, you will do well. The opposite is not necessarily true. You should be able to work towards a common, company-wide goal even when you disagree with the strategy. Doing what is best for Tortuga and our customers is more important than getting your way.</li><li>Taking Initiative: Every company says that it wants to hire self-starters. Remote companies have no choice. You must take initiative and hold yourself accountable to a high standard of work. No one is looking over your shoulder or tracking every minute of your work. You will likely have more autonomy at Tortuga than at your previous jobs.

We’ve been working steadily to engage campuses since 2012. In 2018 we provided materials and resources to 439 college campuses with a total enrollment of 4.7 million students.</p>\n <p>For most of our target states, local state directors lead nonpartisan electoral engagement outreach activities, primarily by building and maintaining partnerships with faculty, staff, administrators and students on college campuses. We also reach schools through partner organizations in states where we don’t have directors and through individual schools that inquire about getting CEEP support. We’ve developed useful resources for schools throughout the country, from specific engagement approaches to our nonpartisan candidate guides. Our <strong>At-Large Director </strong>would use these resources to guide schools in states where we don’t have existing directors toward effective electoral engagement.</p>\n <p>Working across these states, the <strong>At-Large Director </strong>will utilize email, webinars, and more limited direct phone outreach to larger schools. The Director will help schools work with key allies such as Campus Compact affiliates to gain access to the schools, and connect them with individual interested campuses.</p>\n <p>The ideal candidate will have a proven ability to foster strong relationships and stay organized while working on long-term projects. Because this is a new position, you’ll be committed both to developing new ideas and promoting established models of engagement, while handling various points of contact with administrators, faculty and student government leaders.</p>\n <p><strong>This is a remote, contracted position with an hourly wage. </strong>Being a motivated self-starter is a must. <strong>Candidates can be located anywhere in the US.</strong> CEEP is a nonpartisan organization and candidates need to be committed to nonpartisanship and to helping engage all students on the campuses they work with.</p>\n <p><strong>Job Responsibilities:</strong></p>\n <p>The <strong>At-Large Director </strong>reports to the Associate and National Directors and is responsible for the following:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Recruit and manage campus contacts, and work with them to assess the state of their engagement and use our resources and approaches to help them increase it.</li>\n  <li>Respond to interest from individual schools and reach out to major individual schools in states where CEEP isn’t already working.</li>\n  <li>Work with partners like the Compact affiliates to find ways to bring CEEP resources and approaches to their members. Reach out in collaboration with affiliates to help major individual schools increase their engagement efforts.</li>\n  <li>Possibly manage a limited number of student Fellows.</li>\n  <li>Learn where to refer schools on matters of state voter registration, absentee and early voting.</li>\n  <li>Manage data collection of outreach, including contacts, resources distributed, and support provided to schools.</li>\n  <li>Participate in weekly check-ins with the Director or Associate Director. Complete internal projects and tasks.</li>\n  <li>Stay self-organized, submitting reports and projects in a timely manner.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p>\n <p>We’re seeking candidates who excel in relationship building, are results-oriented, and have strong project management and self-management skills. You should have:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>A bachelor’s degree. </strong></li>\n  <li>A track record of developing and maintaining strong working relationships with diverse stakeholders.</li>\n  <li>Strong written and oral communication skills.</li>\n  <li><strong>Self-motivation, persistence, and the ability to excel in a remote work environment. </strong></li>\n  <li>Comfort in developing new initiatives and building some of the road as you travel. You’ll be figuring out ways to engage large numbers of campuses that we haven’t previously worked with, helping them use campus election engagement resources honed through our nearly 10 years in the field.</li>\n  <li>Experience managing multiple projects.</li>\n  <li>Commitment to the CEEP mission and vision of nonpartisan engagement.</li>\n  <li>Ability to prioritize schools and levels of engagement with them. Knowledge of voter outreach practices and experience in campaign or higher education environments are both plusses but are not requirements.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Salary and Location: </strong></p>\n <p><strong>This is a contract position</strong> reporting to CEEP’s National Director. <strong>Hourly fee based on experience (between $22 and $28 per hour). We do not currently offer benefits. This is an opportunity to work full-time from your location with a fantastic team of staff on the critical mission of getting students involved in democracy. </strong></p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://campuselect.org/about-ceep/at-large-director-job-opening/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

This person will also be in charge of our talent recruitment, development, and retention, alongside our Operations and leadership teams.</p>\n <p>Our substantive work advancing our mission of protecting democracy is why we do what we do. But we believe just as deeply that in order to achieve our ambitious mission, we must build an organization rooted in a highly effective and supportive operating model. We, therefore, invest significant resources in building an intentional team culture and strong management systems. Our culture principles guide everything we do. We hire for them, train on them, reinforce them daily, and part ways with people for whom they are not a fit.</p>\n <p>We believe that everyone at Protect Democracy is on a constant path of growth, and we invest in cultivating it for every team member by pairing them with a dedicated growth manager who meets with them weekly to provide coaching.</p>\n <p>We believe our existing principles and systems have created a uniquely healthy culture, where people can work together and communicate with deep honesty in mission-focused ways, with far less political, bureaucratic or interpersonal distractions than are typical of the modern workplace. We also believe our focus on culture and management, and especially in hiring through this lens, have brought together a team of kind and compassionate people who support one another and make each other better.</p>\n <p>As we scale, maintaining our culture and our management systems will be hard enough, but if we are to succeed they will also need to adapt. We are therefore hiring a full-time management expert and strategist to lead our work improving and strengthening our culture and management systems as we scale.</p>\n <p><strong>The Head of Culture and Organizational Strategy will be expected to do the following and possess the following qualities:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Sophisticated understanding of organizational management strategies and tools and experience implementing organization procedures and organizational change successfully.</li>\n  <li>Ability to think deeply about organizational culture and turn that thinking and analysis into actionable plans to deepen and improve org culture.</li>\n  <li>Ability to envision future organizational paths and needs at C-suite level and be able to make hypotheses, crisply tee up decisions, make recommendations, and explain rationales.</li>\n  <li>Ability to anticipate and design efficient and effective hiring and retention processes that will result in bringing in diverse top talent that fits with org, grows with org and stays.</li>\n  <li>Excellent project management skills, including ability to develop project plans, manage teams, and prioritize and efficiently manage multiple project workstreams to successful conclusions.</li>\n  <li>Exceptional diplomatic skills and ability to build strong relationships, including with people from different backgrounds and ideologies.</li>\n  <li>Excellent critical thinking, writing and communications skills.</li>\n  <li>Passion for protecting our democracy and willingness to place that mission above all other professional considerations.</li>\n  <li>Basic understanding of the political-media landscape.</li>\n  <li>Comfort with full transparency on work and proactive managing up, down, and sideways to keep others informed at all times and comfort giving and receiving constant feedback in all directions.</li>\n  <li>Comfort taking smart, strategic, and calculated risks.</li>\n  <li>Comfort working in a collaborative start-up environment, doing whatever is necessary to build the organization and support your own work.</li>\n  <li>Comfort developing relevant metrics and then meeting them.</li>\n  <li>A healthy mix of idealism, sophistication and practicality, coupled with personal kindness and generosity of spirit.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>About Protect Democracy</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Commitment to a diverse workplace. Protect Democracy is an equal opportunity employer. Our culture principles emphasize that there is strength in diversity as we believe diverse teams are more innovative, creative, and productive. Protect Democracy encourages applications from all qualified individuals without regard to race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, national origin, marital status, citizenship, disability, and veteran status.</li>\n  <li>Competitive pay and phenomenal benefits. All positions are<strong>&nbsp;full-time&nbsp;</strong>and offer a salary and benefits that are commensurate with experience and designed to be at the leading edge of competitiveness for the social justice and non-profit sector. While we cannot match for-profit sector salaries, our intent is to not make finance a bar to people who want to do this work on the theory that paying for top talent will result in greater delivery of impact towards our mission. For example, our benefits package includes three months of paid parental leave, a 401k plan in which we match employee contributions dollar for dollar up to 6% of salary, and full coverage for an excellent health care plan.</li>\n  <li><strong>Open to applicants from all over the country. Location requirements are flexible. The only requirement is that your location be one that allows you to complete the demands of the position and mission. We currently have staff in DC, New York, California, Boston, Michigan, Virginia, North Carolina, and Georgia.</strong></li>\n  <li>Ample opportunities for personal &amp; professional development. Candidates who do not meet all listed criteria should still apply, as our organizational structure focuses on providing mentorship and opportunities for professional growth.</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://protectdemocracy.org/x/jobs/head-of-culture-and-organizational-strategy/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

I want them to finish each article feeling empowered, knowing what their next steps are to find the guidance they are searching for.</p>\n  <p>Since it's primarily a Tarot website, I think it is important to reference Tarot cards in each of the articles. It would also be good to link to other relevant (internal) articles, to tie everything together.</p>\n  <p>For example, if you were writing an article on &quot;What is the Law of Attraction (and the exact steps to follow to manifest something into your life)&quot; it would be good to talk about a few Tarot cards that represent manifestation.</p>\n  <p>The articles will be created weekly, and I think the target should be 1,500 - 2,000 words. There's a lot of freedom here, so hopefully this topic interests you.</p>\n  <p>This is a long term project, and if it goes well we can expand it to 2 or 3 articles a week (if you have time) or keep it at 1. There is a huge amount of content to create but I am very flexible.</p>\n  <p><strong>What I am looking for</strong></p>\n  <p>For me, the most important thing is working with a writer that gets things done and doesn't come up with excuses. Having experience with Tarot cards is a plus, but if you're willing to learn I am willing to teach you. A background in SEO is also useful, since one of the secondary goals is to have the articles rank for important keywords.</p>\n  <p>I'm not fussed on education, etc., but your ability to write native english is critical. Also, I really like clear and concise language - I hate it when people are needlessly wordy to fill up space, and to make themselves sound smarter than they actually are :)</p>\n  <p>I also want to listen to you, and do what I can to make this work and fun and enjoyable for you. I want to work with you for YEARS, so let me know what you need and I will do my best to make it happen.</p>\n  <p>If you have a daily rate I can book you for one day a week, or if you prefer the word count way that can work too.</p>\n  <p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p>\n  <p>1) Please share the best article you've ever written, and briefly tell me why it's the best</p>\n  <p>2) Please let me know why you are applying to this job specifically.</p>\n  <p>3) Briefly talk about your background, and why you think it's relevant to where you are now (and this project)</p>\n  <p>4) I want to work with great writers, so the rate is 100% negotiable. Let me know what you think is fair compensation for your services and I will pay it.</p>\n  <p>5) I am going to be hiring several writers as a test, and then awarding the permanent job to the article I like the most. The topic will be &quot;the Law of Attraction&quot;, so let me know what you would include in that article and why. (Note: I am not trying to get you to write a free article. The purpose of the question is to better understand your process, with a relevant example. I will pay you to write the full article you suggest at your full rate if I think we're on the same page.)</p>\n  <p>6) I would love to see your twitter/instagram/blog/work history. etc. so feel free to share whatever you want and I'll take a look at it.</p>\n  <p>Please email your application to hireme (at) jeremydavid (.) com</p>\n  <p>Thank you!</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

If face-to-face counselling could be easily accessed by everyone who needed it, we wouldn’t need to exist. But technology does have a historical knack for putting previously inaccessible resources into the hands of large numbers of people at a fraction of the cost.\n<br>Wouldn’t the world be a better place if everyone could access the benefits of therapy?\n<br>\n<br>We have raised funding from top tier UK investors including Passion Capital and Seedcamp and work with some amazing companies such as Monzo and Rightmove.\n<br>\n<br>The Role\n<br>In order to scale therapy to millions, there are lots of interesting problems to solve: the best way to hire high-quality therapists, how to build a strong sense of community for remote workers and how to ensure that all of our users have a seamless experience on Spill.\n<br>\n<br>We have already put in place some processes, but there is a lot more to build. As the first full-time operations person at Spill, you will have a big opportunity to shape how we think about scaling therapy, and make an impact from day one.\n<br>\n<br>Description\n<br>As the operations manager at Spill, you’ll be responsible for designing, building, and deploying the processes we need to manage our counsellors, our welcomers, and our users.\n<br>\n<br>We’re looking for someone who is systematic, rigorous, and logical. You will need to come up with solutions that are simultaneously robust, scalable, and lightweight. You will also need to be able to switch between big-picture thinking and quick and effective execution. \n<br>\n<br>You should also be excited about helping shape the direction and culture of our operations team going forward.\n<br>\n<br>Who you are \n<br>You are smart, conscientious, scrappy and effective - you know how to get stuff done. However, you can also step back from day-to-day execution and think of ways to automate and scale the things that you do, through a combination of automation and process design.\n<br>\n<br>Requirements\n<br>You have: \n<br>- a science degree, preferably in Maths \n<br>- an ability to work under pressure\n<br>- a capacity to execute in spite of uncertainty and ambiguity\n<br>- a demonstrable ability to learn quickly and a willingness to learn\n<br>- excellent written and spoken communication\n<br>- excellent logic and ability to formulate persuasive arguments\n<br>- excellent interpersonal skills that will allow you to support a large team of people, remotely\n<br>\n<br>Extra credit \n<br>A passion for therapy and self-improvement.",

Machines are increasingly awesome at understanding English, but what about the 5+ billion people who need to communicate in their native language?</p>\n <p>Sinitic automates multilingual customer support with a vertically-integrated product suite and proprietary Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine for Chinese, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Japanese, Thai and other languages. Our core tech includes IP for mixed-language understanding and semi-supervised chat history structuring (we really love NLP). We’re a fast-growing SaaS business with great call center clients from the iGaming and RegTech industries.</p>\n <p><strong>HOW WE WORK</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Build fast with usage:</strong>&nbsp;We deploy functional product and iterate fast with real-time usage. With this approach, Sinitic rapidly implements cutting-edge NLP tech.</p>\n <p><strong>Lead first into frontiers:&nbsp;</strong>We target customer segments in underserved markets around the world. With this curiosity, Sinitic ventures first where others overlook.</p>\n <p><strong>Stay Hyper-Global:</strong>&nbsp;We’re a team with Ukrainian devs building Canadian software powered by Thai NLP for Swedish clients based in the Philippines.</p>\n <p><strong>OUR TECH &amp; ROADMAP</strong></p>\n <p>The backbone of Sinitic consists of several python (micro) services communicating through a message queue server. Our clients have call centers with 24/7 operations, therefore testing and high-availability are critical to us. We are currently hosted on a multi-region GCP infrastructure and rely heavily on Kubernetes and Google Cloud SQL (Postgres) to achieve high levels of stability and performance.</p>\n <p>The heart of Sinitic is driven by our passion to ensure that the conversational AI revolution benefits everyone from all corners of the Earth. To do this, we’re building automation products that go after every mundane task in the customer support domain: livechat, ticketing, chatbot training, upselling, scheduling, and more.</p>\n <p><strong>DO YOUR BEST WORK, FROM ANYWHERE</strong><br>As a remote-first company, our top priority is to implement new ways of enabling your maximum productivity, happiness, and contributions to the team. To accomplish this, we receive incredible support from the Creative Destruction Lab, Next Canada, Ontario Centers of Excellence, the National Research Council of Canada and GCI Ventures.

Together, we’re doing the finest work of our lives.</p>\n <p><strong>ABOUT THE ROLE</strong></p>\n <p>The Director of Accounts leads a multinational team with personnel interchanging between two broad roles: account executives (who discover new business) and account managers (who implement and grow existing business). Sinitic is a scaling startup focused on niche industries where personal, cross-cultural relationships are crucial to growing revenue. As such, the Accounts department is structured to compete&nbsp;<strong>assymetrically</strong>&nbsp;with no pronouced division between pre/post sales, and instead applies the most suited team member(s) to accounts in order to build excellent relationships across all cultures and languages. At its core, this role is about strategically multiplying the department’s human resources in order to punch above its weight globally, and win then grow key accounts. This role is not about quotas, hard-pitching, and the linear processes of traditional software sales departments.</p>\n <p><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>General Experience</strong>: 10+ years in business development and key account management for software development firms.</li>\n  <li><strong>Industry Experience</strong>: Extensive knowledge of the iGaming industry with relationships spanning Philippines, Malta, Gibraltar, UK, and/or Cost Rica.</li>\n  <li><strong>Assymetric Thinker</strong>: Ability to adopt prinicples of “force multiplication” to compete globally with minimal resources.</li>\n  <li><strong>Team Leader:&nbsp;</strong>Support a distributed team of account executives and managers from prospecting to upselling.</li>\n  <li><strong>People Developer:&nbsp;</strong>Effective at developing your team members’ sales and implementation skills so they are comfortable interchanging between roles as required.</li>\n  <li><strong>Product Expert:&nbsp;</strong>Demonstrate natural ability to understand and present a complex B2B SaaS product suite.</li>\n  <li><strong>Great Listener:&nbsp;</strong>Act as the “voice of the clients” in all management and product meetings.</li>\n  <li><strong>Relationship Builder:</strong>&nbsp;Go the extra mile to build lasting relationships with potential and existing clients.</li>\n  <li><strong>Flair for Marketing:</strong>&nbsp;Identify case studies and competitive advantages to pass onto the marketing team.</li>\n  <li><strong>Truly Global:&nbsp;</strong>Personify the company’s global mission with a progressive and multicultural background.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cool Cookie:</strong>&nbsp;This is a startup. We plan ahead but must be nimble and fast to adapt. If we asked your friends, they would say you’re the calmest person they know in tough situations.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>NICE TO HAVES (BUT NOT DEALBREAKERS)</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Knowledge of iGaming contact center operations</li>\n  <li>Multilingual</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>COMPENSATION &amp; BENEFITS</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Above market salary</li>\n  <li>Competitive commission</li>\n  <li>20 vacation days</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Sinitic is committed to equality of opportunity for all team members.

We’re looking for a collaborative but hands-on Release Manager to help us scale our execution to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p>\n <p>Analytics Fire is a deeply technical engineering organization. Most of us are software engineers and spend the majority of our time on heads down engineering activities like coding. Our goal in creating this position is to expand our small client-facing team with a unique person that has both the personality and the technical skillset to help guide software releases through planning, development, deployment, release, and DevOps processes.</p>\n <p>This position is similar to that of a technical Program Manager, but you will be much more involved in the technical details and hurdles around software deployments and releases than a traditional Project Manager would be. Our ideal candidate is a current or former Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Site Reliability Engineer that is willing to be trained in formal Program Management processes (or has already been trained in formal Program Management processes).</p>\n <p>As a small company, Analytics Fire is able to tailor roles around the strengths of our individual team members. We will tailor this role to your specific technical background. However, it is a hard requirement that you are able to support the following 3 types of responsibilities:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>(a) Represent Analytics Fire software engineering teams in client-facing interactions (clarifying requirements, negotiating technical approaches, reporting on status, etc).</li>\n  <li>(b) Technical writing responsibilities such as documenting requirements, project plans, system architecture, etc.</li>\n  <li>(c) Making meaningful contributions to the execution of complex software projects.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>For reference, here is a list of some technologies we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>JavaScript: React / Angular /&nbsp;Typescript / GraphQL</li>\n  <li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node</li>\n  <li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li>\n  <li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li>\n  <li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li>\n  <li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li>\n  <li>Other technologies we are currently building with: AWS, GCP, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Yocto, Salesforce platform, iOS, ARKit</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Description of responsibilities:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Develop and maintain well-coordinated relationships with key internal and client-side stakeholders to help drive decision making around production software releases and DevOps.</li>\n  <li>Participate in collaborative planning discussions and technical decision making early in the project lifecycle to ensure that key decisions are made with reliability, testability, and DevOps in mind.</li>\n  <li>Monitor and oversee coordination, integration, flow of development, testing, and deployment around multiple parallel projects and threads of engineering execution.</li>\n  <li>Drive planning and delivery of high quality software releases:</li>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Manage change control process during releases</li>\n   <li>Continuously improve company release processes</li>\n   <li>Proactively identify and mitigate risks and remove obstacles to releases</li>\n  </ul>\n  <li>Personally plan and participate in software release activities. Advise and support the team so that they can take on less critical releases on a day-to-day basis.</li>\n  <li>Continually integrate the QA team and testing engineers into both the requirements gathering and software development processes and report status to clients on a very frequent basis.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>This is a remote position but is only open to candidates living in the US or Canada. (Note: we may be open to US or Canadian citizens living abroad in US-overlapping time zones on a case by case basis.) We’re flexible about location and hours. We’re a really great match for candidate who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p>\n <p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>\n <p>“Must have” requirements:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Soft skills necessary to develop and maintain well-coordinated relationships with key internal and client-side stakeholders to help drive decision making around production software releases and DevOps.</li>\n  <li>3+ years hands experience as a full stack Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, or Site Reliability Engineer, ideally within a commercial startup environment.</li>\n  <li>Familiarity with current modern best practices around software development, data engineering, and DevOps</li>\n  <li>Ability and willingness to familiarize yourself with the specific technical stacks that we use.</li>\n  <li>Superior organization and detail orientation.</li>\n  <li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</li>\n  <li>Willingness to design, document, and evangelize new engineering processes to meet evolving organizational requirements.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>“Nice to have” requirements:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Hands-on technical experience writing code in&nbsp;Ruby, Python, or JavaScript</li>\n  <li>Previous experience as a technical Program Manager.</li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/206463?reset=False&amp;ra=17eXvp489bqg&amp;oqs=a%3D17eXvp489bqg' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a>\n</div>\n<div> \n</div> \n<h4>About Analytics Fire</h4> \n<div>\n <p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p>\n <p>“We founded Analytics Fire to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. To us that means being able to spend our time working on interesting technical problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.&quot;</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Remote</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible Schedule</span> </li> \n</ul>",

You might be the perfect fit for this full-time, remote position if you think quickly on your feet, have a knack for creative problem solving and revel in bringing a team together to exceed client expectations on each and every project.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Aeolidia is a “one stop shop” design agency that develops brands and creates story-centered ecommerce websites for designers, artisans, and curators that have made it past the startup phase. We pair our custom strategic Shopify websites with analytical insights to continually optimize clients’ sites, resulting in significant growth to their online retail sales.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Our employees are directly responsible for empowering awesome business owners to succeed, and are challenged with meaningful work that improves their particular skills. If this all sounds excellent to you, please keep reading to see if we might be a match to work together!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4>About Us</h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Aeolidia is a graphic design and web development agency that has been working with designer and artisan businesses since 2004. We’re the preeminent design team in our creative niche, and we dig deep into strategy based on information we get from each client’s website analytics while also truly understanding the branding part of it. We deliver a gorgeous AND powerful site every time.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  A designer or artist’s story should be compelling to customers. We focus on storytelling for brands. This is about each business’s “why” and what makes them unique and irreplaceable to their perfect customers. Since we do business naming, brand vision and voice, brand graphic identity, copywriting, and photography in-house, we have the capability to craft a cohesive story without losing anything along the way.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We are a remote team of overachievers, united in our common goal of taking creative businesses to the next level by paving the way toward substantial increases to online sales.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4>Now Let’s Talk About You</h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  As the Web Project Manager, you’re a leader, a creative problem solver, and a project manager all in one. You are energized by working with people and keeping projects moving forward. No stranger to delegation, your primary role is to oversee the entire creative process from start to finish. You’re a visionary who can clearly communicate ideas and expectations, as well as facilitate inspired and enthusiastic discussions, all while keeping the team focused and on track with project timelines and deadlines. Your clients’ success is your success – when they win, you win, too!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Here are just a few ways we see you being successful in the Web Project Manager role with Aeolidia:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>You’re a Diligent Achiever</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You work smartly to deliver a truly top notch experience to your clients. You seek unique solutions, meet each deadline, and just plain get things done. You are a reliable go-getter.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Capable, persistent, and resourceful, you never despair when you hit a roadblock or need to figure out something new. You give it a try, do the research, try try again, ask for help, test it out, succeed, then consider it a learning experience and a new tool in your kit.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>You’re a Curious Learner</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You know it would be easy to keep doing what has worked in the past, but you also know that technology changes quickly, each business is different, and what works in one case won’t be the best solution in others.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You stay abreast of advancements in design, technology, and each specialty area in your role. You value being at the top of your game, even as things change. You have big ideas, and you’re eager to figure out how to do them.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>You’re a Humble Expert</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  It’s important that each member of our team approaches the client relationship from the mindset of a “doctor”—using their years of expertise and insight to prescribe the right solution. This is in sharp contrast to the “waiter” mentality of taking orders and doing what is asked of us.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You remember that each client knows their business better than you do, and that you have a lot to learn from them. You strike the balance by being authoritative but cooperative and open-minded. You are experienced and your role is to help guide your client down the path to their goal.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You are highly collaborative and function well within a team. You feel comfortable asking for help and being open about what you don’t yet know. And, in turn, eagerly show up and share the special knowledge you do have without being arrogant about it. You also facilitate a team environment where each member feels the same.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>You’re a Positive Ally</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You anticipate your clients’ needs and concerns, and take an active role in making them feel comfortable with their brand, their technology, and their next steps.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  When you see a problem you can solve or help with, you leap to action to make progress toward a solution. You take as much responsibility for client dissatisfaction as you can, knowing that you’re the one guiding the relationship and setting expectations.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You find solutions that are more than just acceptable, but something the client is happy with, and that keeps your relationship with them on a good track.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>You’re a Creative Supporter</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Your work is meaningful to you. Making a website and getting money is not the satisfying part. You’re in this to watch your clients exceed their goals and feel proud to have contributed.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You care about and believe in your clients’ businesses. You have a personal connection that makes the journeys of designer and artisan businesses meaningful to you.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You understand, you relate to, you value and respect each client and their business. With every step on their project, you are aiming to propel your client to where they want to be next.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4>A Day in the Life</h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Now that we’ve covered what it’s like to work with Aeolidia, let’s chat about what you would be doing on an average day. The full-time Web Project Manager will work approximately 40 hours per week guiding the entire process for each of our client projects from start to finish. This includes gathering all needed information from our sales staff, communicating it to the team, creating and balancing realistic schedules between clients, and aligning scope and objectives with to-dos and milestones.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You will be responsible for a Client Care Specialist, a Project Assistant, and a team of designers and developers who each own a piece of the client project.
