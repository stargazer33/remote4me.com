This is a role where you will be with the exec team one day, and in the trenches the next. All our execs also are in the weeds, doing the work. If you have graduated to the point you are above placing ads, writing copy, deciphering GA, or following up on a PR call, you’re not the right candidate.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Communications: You need grammatically correct written communication skills. You can present well at all levels. You can talk and present in layman's terms at a company meeting, or you can host a white paper talk to fellow Marketers. You have wonderful interpersonal skills and can persuade, manage conflict, debate, negotiate and conduct meetings. You respond to pressure in a calm and reasonable manner.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Judgment: You make good decisions and take responsibility for them. You can initiate and perform work assignments under minimal supervision that may be broad, varied, and complex in nature. You know how to choose the correct course of action from a given set of variables, with limited data, and with limited direction.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Organization: We’re assuming you couldn’t have gotten to where you are without excellent organizational skills and time management skills that allow you to accomplish big goals. We want you to bring those skills with you.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Ownership Mentality: This is one of our core values. We are looking for someone who doesn’t just want a job. We want someone who thinks of themselves as an owner and steward of the company. This means you have the ability to make decisions based on what’s good for the long-term success of the organization and its people. You can get big results from small budgets. You have an internal disgust for company politics. And you understand what “We, not Me” means.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Management: You have mastered the disciplines of a manager, including visioning, planning, evaluating, making hard choices, organizing, and building up your team. You don’t have an ego and can solicit feedback as well as give direction to others.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Salary and Benefits&nbsp;</div><div>Competitive Pay: We are looking for the right person, and will pay up for her or him.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Access to full benefits:&nbsp; We have full health care, optional vision and dental, and a 401K&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Stock Options: Remember when we said we were looking for people who think like owners? We put our money where our mouth is. Each employee qualifies for stock options. Our goal is to make them worth a lot of money.&nbsp;</div><div>Being a part of an exciting tech startup: Yeah, we’re a bit older than most fledgling startups. But don’t let that fool you. We very much think of ourselves as a startup: fast moving, fail a lot, try things, no offices, no corporate BS, etc. But, since we’ve been around, that means we’ve found product-market fit and we’ve lowered the risk of a normal startup. So you get the best of both worlds - a fiery startup feel with the security of knowing we’re on the right track.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Freedom: We do have standard hours most of us work (8:00-ish to 6:00-ish), but we don’t micro-manage. At the end of the day, you will be judged by the work you produce and the health of your team, not by the number of Slack messages you send. &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Working with great people: When you strip away all the benefits, all the tech stacks, and all the roadmaps, it’s really about the people. What you’ll find is that TakeLessons is filled with hardworking, honest, friendly, people who are here to build something great with their teammates. &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Ready to apply?&nbsp;</div><div>Great! We can’t wait to meet you. Here’s the next steps:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>All applicants must apply online at: https://takelessons.com/about/careers#join&nbsp;</div><div>• No phone calls or agencies please&nbsp;</div><div>• Sponsorship not available&nbsp;</div><div>• We are an equal opportunity employer and welcome diverse backgrounds&nbsp;</div></div>",

We do this by connecting anyone with spare food &ndash; which can be households or food businesses &ndash; with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away &pound;800 of food each year - collectively adding up to &pound;15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile &amp; web apps.</p><br /><p>Over the past 4 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. We now have over 1.5m users who have together shared well over 2.5 million portions of food &ndash; with food being successfully shared in 49 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our volunteer programme, with over 40,000 people reaching out to spread the word about OLIO in their local community and rescue unsold food.</p><br /><p>In addition, OLIO works with ~400 business locations across the UK with <a href='https://olioex.com/get-involved/volunteer/food-waste-heroes/'>Food Waste Heroes</a> completing ~2,000 surplus food collections each week.

We are particularly focused on developing new digital media models that engage communities of color and low-income communities, as well as models that bring together diverse citizens across class and race. We focus on media ventures that are driving social change through news, education, and action.<br>Accelerate Change uses lean startup methodologies and other business strategies to help start-up nonprofit ventures and established organizations scale their digital media relationships and revenue.</p><p><strong>Here’s some more information on those strategies:</strong></p><ul><li>Functional Organizing: Our model is based on the idea that membership organizations can experience explosive, financially sustainable growth when they provide a robust set of benefits and services that have an outstanding value to the people they seek to organize (functional organizing). Learn more about our model for scalable citizen organizing in the article, The Secret of Scale from the Stanford Social Innovation Review.</li><li>Lean startup methodologies: Our approach is centered on identifying challenges and unmet needs in people’s lives. We use lean startup methodologies to rigorously test ideas for services and benefits that could help address those pain points and provide real value in people’s everyday lives. Read more about our approach to experimentation in the article, The Promise of Lean Experimentation from the Stanford Social Innovation Review. Accelerate Change supports some of the fastest growing nonprofit digital media ventures in the country, with a particular focus on communities of color.

    "content": "<p><em>We are seeking a hands-on Head of Technology for our well funded e-commerce fulfillment startup</em></p><br /><p>At Bezos, our vision is to Deliver Happiness: For our team, for the end consumers, for the e-commerce sellers as well as our logistics partners.<br />Exciting times in e-commerce: E-commerce sales in Europe is projected to be &pound;406 billion by 2023, expected to grow 8% per year between 2018-2023. The growth is driven by consumers that increasingly buy more online as well as the emergence of small and medium e-commerce sellers, which have grown at 18% and 28% per year, respectively between 2009-2017. There are 200,000 small and medium e-commerce sellers in the UK alone, selling their products through multiple channels, including marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay, their own websites, and on social media like Facebook and Instagram. Today, these small and medium sellers are ignored by the large incumbent logistics service providers and we are on a mission to change that.</p><br /><p><br /><strong>Building a next generation Fulfillment-as-a-Service platform:</strong> With this explosive growth in e-commerce, the demand for e-commerce fulfilment and delivery is booming. Bezos is a next generation Fulfillment-as-a-Service (FaaS) platform, that allows small and medium e-commerce sellers to outsource their fulfilment and delivery, and focus on what is more important: growing their businesses. By providing a one-stop-shop solution for e-commerce logistics, we make it super easy for sellers to manage their logistics, eliminating the hassle of storage, fulfillment, last mile delivery and returns. Our sellers benefit from our pay-as-you go model, flexible contracts, and high data visibility through our platform. Bezos&rsquo; operational model is based on partnering with certified logistics suppliers that will execute the different services on our behalf. We believe there is a massive market opportunity to serve<br />these currently unattended and fast growing small and medium e-commerce sellers. And that is just the beginning: our vision for the future of the e-commerce logistics landscape foresees significant structural changes in order to comply with the growing changes in customer expectations regarding delivery speed and quality. We believe this will give place to significant disruption opportunities, and we are planning on taking a leading role to achieve them.</p><br /><p><strong>Two founders with proven track record:</strong> The founding team consists of Diego Lijtmaer and Vernon<br />Tjon-Soei-Len, who are two seasoned technology executives with experience in e-commerce, the gig economy and last mile delivery industry. Diego built the business development and logistics functions at Just Eat Plc (food delivery, FTSE 100), where he was responsible for building relationships with the global branded restaurant groups, and also in charge of designing and building the UK delivery operations. Before Just Eat, Diego founded and ran a hospitality business Bacanal and worked in investment banking at UBS (LinkedIn profile here). Vernon was Director of Amazon Flex UK (part of Amazon&rsquo;s Last Mile Product &amp; Technology team), a crowdsourced last mile delivery solution with tens of thousands of drivers, enabling everyone with a vehicle and mobile phone to deliver packages for Amazon. Prior to that, Vernon worked at Zipcar, the global car sharing company, Bain &amp; Company and started his career in investment banking at JPMorgan (LinkedIn profile here).</p><br /><p><br /><strong>We are looking for an exceptional technology leader:</strong> Someone that gets excited about the adventure of a startup and wants to build a world class billion dollar business.

We’ve been storing user data and corporate data on the same servers, when we should have been storing user data on the user side. Company-owned user data is expensive and it’s pretty bad. It’s non-dynamic, non-representative, single-source information that costs every website and app in the world 23% of their engineering budget.</p><p>The Dataswift API-driven technology platform lets companies give user information back to their users, storing on user-owned infrastructure  instead of on their corporate servers. They don’t have to change anything else about their app or technology in order to do this. Dataswift is working with dozens of companies around the world,  including some of the largest pharmaceuticals and smallest, fastest-growing FinTechs.</p><p>Dataswift Culture &amp; Values</p><p>Your impact: With your expertise and commitment you will actively shape our growth and the team itself! With our mission lock, the company is set to generate global social impact through changing the internet. </p><p>Teamwork: We pride ourselves on working around each other’s constraints. Need flexible hours due to childcare? We do that already. Need to work remotely part of the week due to personal commitments? We do that already. </p><p>Stable environment: We have just raised seed funding which will take us to the end of 2020 and we have guaranteed commitment from our investors on Series A funding if we successfully reach our goals in the next 16 months. </p><p>Growth: We have a 20% rule which means that we believe in learning through failure and growing by reaching for the stars so we expect to fail 20% of our goals. </p><p>The team’s favourite benefits:</p><ol><li><p>Remote working options </p></li><li><p>Unlimited holiday</p></li><li><p>Budget for personal development and training</p></li><li><p>Countryside office if you prefer the peace and quiet of Cambridge countryside</p></li><li><p>Regular team away days and bonding time</p></li></ol><p>We believe in the diversity of our team and we don’t judge based on gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic background, history, culture, geography, nationality or any other possible discriminatory category.

We&rsquo;re creating power-tools for people that will help them solve real-life business problems faster, enabling consistently better decision-making. And because our Machine Learning products don&rsquo;t require big data or massive computing resources, we&rsquo;re making it much more accessible. We can work with sparse information and can be implemented with a lean team. We need a marketer who can help us communicate that shift from the status-quo.</p><br /><h3><strong>What you&rsquo;ll be doing</strong></h3><br /><p><strong>Leading</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You&rsquo;ll build and manage a marketing organisation comprised of internal and agency resources. As part of this you&rsquo;ll be setting and sticking to budgets, defining your team&rsquo;s objectives, and getting everyone to deliver their best.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Brand Development&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; We&rsquo;re at an exciting juncture and will rely on you to see the company through this journey. It will be your responsibility to ensure the company&rsquo;s identity, personality, and messaging are communicated consistently across all touchpoints.</p><br /><p><strong>Product Marketing</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You will support and enable tight coordination of the Product Definition, Product Messaging, and Product Marketing. You will work with the Product Managers to help them develop products you&rsquo;ll be excited to market.</p><br /><p><strong>Thought Leadership&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Given our unique approach in this noisy space, you will be working with the Comms Team to highlight the companies leadership and messages.</p><br /><p><strong>Growth</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Your team will work with our Business Development team to grow awareness, interest, engagement, and purchase across all channels. Key initiatives include &ndash; but certainly aren&rsquo;t limited to &ndash; Events, Keynotes, Case Studies, Website, Blog, ABM, Email, SEO, SEM, Social.</p><br /><p><strong>Test &amp; Scale</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You will build a Marketing Lab to test different marketing investments &ndash; Paid-, Owned-, Earned-, Shared Media &ndash; and then scale them. You will define the metrics that matter, ensure accurate and timely tracking/reporting, and share key insights across the organisation. You will build relationships internally to leverage our ML models to help your team to do this.</p><br /><h3><strong>What skills, experience, qualifications do you need to succeed in this role?</strong></h3><br /><p><strong>You&rsquo;re curious about technology</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You might not know much about AI or ML, but you&rsquo;re dying to dig in and learn.</p><br /><p><strong>Ability to translate techno-speak&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; You&rsquo;ve demonstrated the ability to soak up enough knowledge about deep tech and translate it into marketing that speaks to different audiences: CEOs to CTOs, GMs to Engineers, Investors, Analysts, Trade &amp; Mainstream Press, and our own employees. Some of it needs to operate at a high level: plain English, simple. But you&rsquo;ll also be reviewing some White Papers.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>You&rsquo;re a scientist, a mind-reader, and an artist&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; You&rsquo;re data-driven and run tests using hypothesis. You&rsquo;re people-centric, building a deep empathy for our customers, partners, employees.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>You work with creative people</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; writers, designers, art-directors, web developers &ndash; to create clear and compelling stories and assets. You take pride in your ability to shift between your left and right brain.</p><br /><p><strong>You combine an enterprise toolkit with a startup mindset&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; You&rsquo;ve led Marketing teams in larger organisations and are excited to help bring our new brand to life. There&rsquo;s a lot of work to do, so you&rsquo;ll want to be someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>You&rsquo;re a Thinker and a Doer&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Strategic Direction, Messaging Constructs, Communication Plans are all things you&rsquo;ll be developing, but you&rsquo;ll equally love executing them just as much, as you&rsquo;ll understand how best they&rsquo;re done, you can build your org to support those functions.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Experience</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; You&rsquo;ll have significant experience in marketing leadership roles at B2B technology companies.</p><br /><h3>About Prowler.io</h3><br /><p>We are a world-class, cross-disciplinary team of researchers, engineers and product managers in Cambridge, UK, the global centre of AI excellence, combining branches of mathematics and engineering in ways that have never been done before.

    "content": "<p><strong>Why Deliveroo?</strong><br />When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.</p><br /><p>We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are already transforming the way people think about food, providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.</p><br /><p>We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauces that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.</p><br /><p>And we&rsquo;re just getting started.</p><br /><p>The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at &pound;7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it&rsquo;s clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.</p><br /><p>We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT&rsquo;s&rsquo; list of Europe&rsquo;s fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte&rsquo;s &lsquo;UK Top 50&rsquo; two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.</p><br /><p><strong>About the Production Platform Group</strong><br />The production platform group build, maintain and secure services, tooling and infrastructure that is relied upon by the rest of the company to provide excellent service to our customers, riders and restaurants.</p><br /><p>Furthermore, the teams all play a consultancy role to the other product engineering teams, evangelizing and helping the adoption of said services, tools and infra as well as helping to build reliability guidelines.</p><br /><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong><br />There are three core areas; planning, communications and engineering processes.</p><br /><p><strong>Day to day:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Work with the engineers to build a roadmap, prioritize and execute the backlog</li><br /><li>Track issues and find solutions for programme problems as they arise</li><br /><li>Stakeholder management: This is a critical role for Deliveroo to make sure both external and internal teams are working toward the same goal and managing communication &amp; changes. You&rsquo;ll need to advocate for all stakeholders throughout the program to ensure they have the support needed to succeed</li><br /><li>Process optimisation: It&rsquo;s essential that we continue to learn. You&rsquo;ll be responsible for identifying where we can improve, and making sure that we execute required changes across teams</li><br /><li>Workflow improvement: You will work closely with your team to define and maintain work practices, tools and guidelines across the team</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Skills include:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Passion for working with devops and infrastructure teams</li><br /><li>Interpersonal skills to build relationships, and collaborate with diverse geographically distributed teams</li><br /><li>Manage multiple facets of a large-scale project and track progress</li><br /><li>Work on many tasks at once, which makes multitasking skills a must-have</li><br /><li>Solve problems to keep multiple programmes of work on track</li><br /><li>Work effectively in a constantly evolving and ambiguous environment</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Experience:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>3+ years of industry experience as a Technical Programme Manager</li><br /><li>Ability to effectively articulate technical challenges to all org levels</li><br /><li>Incident management experience</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Life at Deliveroo</strong><br />We are a growing team, with a very large impact, seeking to solve some of the most interesting challenges out there. We move fast, we&rsquo;re always looking for new ideas and the entire company is very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.</p><br /><p>There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven&rsquo;t even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours to work on. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.</p><br /><p><strong>Benefits and Diversity</strong><br />At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.</p><br /><p>In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role, to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company&rsquo;s success.</p><br /><p>We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-ups around.</p>",

It goes without saying that delivering projects to tight deadlines with customer focus and product discipline will form a key accountability.</p><br /><p><br /><br /></p><br /><p><strong>Culture and Personality:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Willing to work hard but also have fun</li><br /><li>Good sense of humour</li><br /><li>Entrepreneurial spirit</li><br /><li>Innovative and open-minded</li><br /><li>Tenacious problem-solver</li><br /><li>Proactive self-starter</li><br /><li>Able to work as part of a wider team</li><br /><li>An appetite for learning</li><br /><li>A passion for technology of all types</li><br /><li>An interest in health and wellbeing</li><br /><li>Enjoys a social office atmosphere</li><br /><li>An appetite to achieve great things and to help many vulnerable people remain independent in their own homes</li><br /></ul><br /><p><br /><br /></p><br /><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>30 days holiday + your birthday + Public Holidays</li><br /><li>Fruit, Coffee, Tea and breakfast all are in office</li><br /><li>Remote working possible</li><br /><li>Private Health Insurance</li><br /><li>Life Insurance</li><br /><li>Pension scheme</li><br /><li>Office dog (hypoallergenic)</li><br /><li>Relaxed startup environment - your input matters</li><br /><li>Company laptop</li><br /></ul><br /><p><br /><br /></p><br /><p><strong>About MySense</strong></p><br /><p>MySense is a wellbeing analytics platform built on compassion, by people who understand what it&rsquo;s like to care for a loved one. But we&rsquo;re also a team of dedicated (self-proclaimed) nerds, tech is what we know and love. So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

As we believe that no two people are the same and that there is no “one fits all” solution, “individual” is the keyword here.</li><li>You’ll work closely with the MoCs (Master of Ceremonies) of our teams and help them on their road to continuous improvement. You are the people person for those teams when it comes to moderation of retros as well as a sparring partner for people issues. We encourage self-organization a lot, but if there is a need for your support, you are there.</li><li>You foster our self-organization throughout the company, enabling individuals and teams to make their own decisions with confidence, allowing the company to remain a group of individuals walking in the same direction. Nobody is left behind. You ensure this structure is under constant review and communicated in a way that makes it understandable for all involved.</li><li>You will work with diverse parties of the organization on topics such as team development, self-organisation, individual growth, responsibilities and accountability. We strongly believe in agility and want to continue being at the forefront of the new work era. All your initiatives need to fit in our remote and agile context.</li><li>To learn more about how we work, you can check out the Inside Giant Swarm Blog Posts: https://blog.giantswarm.io/inside/</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>You have at least 5+ years experience in working in People Operations (or in an agile consulting company) and you’ll survive the fact that we really like iterating. We will never have a final plan, knowing that things that work today won’t work tomorrow. Uncertainty is your motivator.</li><li>You can give proposals, and defend them when challenged, in a very self-organized environment where obviously everyone has an opinion about people topics as it affects us all.</li><li>You have been working in a startup environment and having worked remotely already is a plus as this will help you understand the challenges that come with working in this way, as few companies are currently organised this way</li><li>You’re happy to hop between individual (people) and organisation levels. In the beginning, it will be more organizational work.</li><li>You have a strong interest and at best you already have experience in agile methodologies. It would be great if you have already worked with software teams. Our purpose is to create similar structures in the entire company, so if you have experience there – great!</li><li>Being a certified coach and or scrum master is a big plus</li><li>You are happy with English as our company language</li></ul><p><strong>Why we think this job is worth applying (challenge us!):</strong></p><ul><li>Impact, Impact, Impact! We are a remote-first organization with a growing team (from 15+ European countries) Every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.</li><li>“It’s better to ask forgiveness than permission” (Paolini) – sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which, is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things by the guidebook. You can try things out! Our default to 100% transparency will help you here.</li><li>Appreciation and trust are the columns for our People Operations work. We try not to use “new work” as a buzzword, we try to live it. Larissa, Mirco and Anna (your future colleagues can talk for hours about that ;))</li></ul><p><strong>WHY Giant Swarm?</strong></p><p>We can give you a glimpse on how working with us will be like:</p><p><strong>Self-organization</strong></p><p>Creative work needs freedom and openness. We encourage you to do your work wherever and whenever you want. We expect passion and encourage sustainability. If you need rest, take it. We don’t count holidays – we count outcome.</p><p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p><p>We are a growing company with 50+ team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible. Always question the status quo and find new ways of collaboration and team-work.</p><p><strong>Learning</strong></p><p>Learning is mandatory and fun at the same time. If you realize you want to expand your knowledge in a specific area, we support you with conferences, books etc.</p><p><strong>Basics</strong></p><p>We offer fair (transparent and open) salaries with benefits like choosing your own laptop, additional perks (for example, a location-aware, fixed amount paid each month to cover costs like co-working, phone contracts or gym memberships), paid parental leave and healthcare compensation are compulsory. And you will participate in our stock options program. Currently, our team members have more children than we are employees. So family-friendliness is a must.</p><p>We are not hiring job descriptions. We hire humans. </p><p>We welcome applications from everybody, regardless of ethnic or national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or age.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://giantswarm.breezy.hr/p/fb4e6b17be83-people-development-manager-100--remote' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

As we believe that no two people are the same and that there is no “one fits all” solution, “individual” is the keyword here.\\n\\n* You’ll work closely with the MoCs (Master of Ceremonies) of our teams and help them on their road to continuous improvement. You are the people person for those teams when it comes to moderation of retros as well as a sparring partner for people issues. We encourage self-organization a lot, but if there is a need for your support, you are there.\\n\\n* You foster our self-organization throughout the company, enabling individuals and teams to make their own decisions with confidence, allowing the company to remain a group of individuals walking in the same direction. Nobody is left behind. You ensure this structure is under constant review and communicated in a way that makes it understandable for all involved.\\n\\n* You will work with diverse parties of the organization on topics such as team development, self-organisation, individual growth, responsibilities and accountability. We strongly believe in agility and want to continue being at the forefront of the new work era. All your initiatives need to fit in our remote and agile context.\\n\\n* To learn more about how we work, you can check out the Inside Giant Swarm Blog Posts:&nbsp;https://blog.giantswarm.io/inside/\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* You have at least 5+ years experience in working in People Operations (or in an agile consulting company) and you’ll survive the fact that we really like iterating. We will never have a final plan, knowing that things that work today won't work tomorrow. Uncertainty is your motivator.\\n\\n* You can give proposals, and defend them when challenged, in a very self-organized environment where obviously everyone has an opinion about people topics as it affects us all.\\n\\n* You have been working in a startup environment and having worked remotely already is a plus as this will help you understand the challenges that come with working in this way, as few companies are currently organised this way\\n\\n* You’re happy to hop between individual (people) and organisation levels. In the beginning, it will be more organizational work.\\n\\n* You have a strong interest and at best you already have experience in agile methodologies. It would be great if you have already worked with software teams. Our purpose is to create similar structures in the entire company, so if you have experience there - great!\\n\\n* Being a certified coach and or scrum master is a big plus\\n\\n* You are happy with English as our company language\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n&nbsp;Why we think this job is worth applying (challenge us!)\\n\\n\\n* Impact, Impact, Impact! We are a remote-first organization with a growing team (from 15+ European countries) Every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.\\n\\n* “It's better to ask forgiveness than permission” (Paolini) - sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which, is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things by the guidebook. You can try things out! Our default to 100% transparency will help you here.\\n\\n* Appreciation and trust are the columns for our People Operations work. We try not to use “new work” as a buzzword, we try to live it. Larissa, Mirco and Anna (your future colleagues can talk for hours about that ;))\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWHY Giant Swarm?\\n\\nWe can give you a glimpse on how working with us will be like:\\n\\nSelf-organization\\n\\nCreative work needs freedom and openness. We encourage you to do your work wherever and whenever you want. We expect passion and encourage sustainability. If you need rest, take it. We don't count holidays - we count outcome.\\n\\nTeamwork\\n\\nWe are a growing company with 50+ team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible. Always question the status quo and find new ways of collaboration and team-work.\\n\\nLearning\\n\\nLearning is mandatory and fun at the same time. If you realize you want to expand your knowledge in a specific area, we support you with conferences, books etc.\\n\\nBasics\\n\\nWe offer fair (transparent and open) salaries with benefits like choosing your own laptop, additional perks (for example, a location-aware, fixed amount paid each month to cover costs like co-working, phone contracts or gym memberships), paid parental leave and healthcare compensation are compulsory. And you will participate in our stock options program. Currently, our team members have more children than we are employees. So family-friendliness is a must.\\n\\nWe are not hiring job descriptions. We hire humans. :)\\n\\nWe welcome applications from everybody, regardless of ethnic or national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or age.\\n\\nInterested? Questions? Coffee?

TurboVote signed up its six millionth voter in 2018 by building the largest college, nonprofit, and corporate voter engagement coalition in the country, including more than 300 campuses, companies like Starbucks, Univision, Facebook, Google, Snap, and dozens more. We also helped (basically) everyone find their polling place through the Voting Information Project. Its data had 123 million impressions in 2016, and over 11 million voters looked up where to vote on GetToThePolls.com. Ballot Scout helps election administrators track absentee ballots through the mail, providing transparency in the vote-by-mail process and making it easier to follow up when things go awry.

As we believe that no two people are the same and that there is no “one fits all” solution, “individual” is the keyword here.</li><li>You’ll work closely with the MoCs (Master of Ceremonies) of our teams and help them on their road to continuous improvement. You are the people person for those teams when it comes to moderation of retros as well as a sparring partner for people issues. We encourage self-organization a lot, but if there is a need for your support, you are there.</li><li>You foster our self-organization throughout the company, enabling individuals and teams to make their own decisions with confidence, allowing the company to remain a group of individuals walking in the same direction. Nobody is left behind. You ensure this structure is under constant review and communicated in a way that makes it understandable for all involved.</li><li>You will work with diverse parties of the organization on topics such as team development, self-organisation, individual growth, responsibilities and accountability. We strongly believe in agility and want to continue being at the forefront of the new work era. All your initiatives need to fit in our remote and agile context.</li><li>To learn more about how we work, you can check out the Inside Giant Swarm Blog Posts:&nbsp;<a href='https://blog.giantswarm.io/inside/' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.giantswarm.io/inside/</a></li></ul><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have at least 5+ years experience in working in People Operations (or in an agile consulting company) and you’ll survive the fact that we really like iterating. We will never have a final plan, knowing that things that work today won't work tomorrow. Uncertainty is your motivator.</li><li>You can give proposals, and defend them when challenged, in a very self-organized environment where obviously everyone has an opinion about people topics as it affects us all.</li><li>You have been working in a startup environment and having worked remotely already is a plus as this will help you understand the challenges that come with working in this way, as few companies are currently organised this way</li><li>You’re happy to hop between individual (people) and organisation levels. In the beginning, it will be more organizational work.</li><li>You have a strong interest and at best you already have experience in agile methodologies. It would be great if you have already worked with software teams. Our purpose is to create similar structures in the entire company, so if you have experience there - great!</li><li>Being a certified coach and or scrum master is a big plus</li><li>You are happy with English as our company language</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;Why we think this job is worth applying (challenge us!)</strong></p><ul><li>Impact, Impact, Impact! We are a remote-first organization with a growing team (from 15+ European countries) Every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.</li><li>“It's better to ask forgiveness than permission” (Paolini) - sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which, is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things by the guidebook. You can try things out! Our default to 100% transparency will help you here.</li><li>Appreciation and trust are the columns for our People Operations work. We try not to use “new work” as a buzzword, we try to live it. Larissa, Mirco and Anna (your future colleagues can talk for hours about that ;))</li></ul><p><strong>WHY Giant Swarm?</strong></p><p>We can give you a glimpse on how working with us will be like:</p><p><strong>Self-organization</strong></p><p>Creative work needs freedom and openness. We encourage you to do your work wherever and whenever you want. We expect passion and encourage sustainability. If you need rest, take it. We don't count holidays - we count outcome.</p><p><strong>Teamwork</strong></p><p>We are a growing company with 50+ team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible. Always question the status quo and find new ways of collaboration and team-work.</p><p><strong>Learning</strong></p><p>Learning is mandatory and fun at the same time. If you realize you want to expand your knowledge in a specific area, we support you with conferences, books etc.</p><p><strong>Basics</strong></p><p>We offer fair (transparent and open) salaries with benefits like choosing your own laptop, additional perks (for example, a location-aware, fixed amount paid each month to cover costs like co-working, phone contracts or gym memberships), paid parental leave and healthcare compensation are compulsory. And you will participate in our stock options program. Currently, our team members have more children than we are employees. So family-friendliness is a must.</p><p>We are not hiring job descriptions. We hire humans. :)</p><p>We welcome applications from everybody, regardless of ethnic or national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or age.</p><p>Interested? Questions? Coffee?

The company is based in Cologne, Germany, where we have a small office in a coworking space. However, only a few people work there. All workflows are created to function remotely - but of course, if you want to visit Cologne, you are more than welcome!</p><p>While we are remote first, we appreciate quality time with our co-workers, so we meet in person twice a year to work and have fun together.</p><p><strong>Work-life integration</strong></p><ul><li>Flexible working hours, and working from home or anywhere you prefer but please note that your permanent location should be somewhere in Europe.</li><li>Currently, the number of kids from our team members outnumbers the number of employees.</li><li>We don’t only care about the kids “within” the company, but also about all children - for example, we compensate the carbon of all our flights.</li><li>As an international company, we want to create similar standards for everyone, regardless of location. So, additional perks (for example, a location-aware, fixed amount paid each month to cover costs like co-working, phone contracts or gym memberships), paid parental leave and healthcare compensation are compulsory.</li></ul>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>unlimited holidays</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>fair and transparent open salaries</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>familiy friendlyness is a must</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>choose the time you want to work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>choose the devices you want to work with</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>remote work possible</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Launched in the U.K. in December 2018, after 6 years operating in New Zealand, CoGo wants to transform every pound that U.K. consumers spend into a vote for a better future. The platform is the first tech innovation that has the aim of leveraging spending data and every transaction made by a consumer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><a href='https://cogo.co'><strong>CoGo</strong></a> has recently launched the world's first-ever &quot;ethical wallet share&quot;. We are the UK&rsquo;s national aggregator of data on accredited businesses and we are using this data, in conjunction with <a href='https://www.openbanking.org.uk/'><strong>Open Banking</strong></a>, to build a platform that can tell our users what percentage of their spending is with businesses that align with their values. This enables our core value proposition: a recommendation engine that helps our users shift more of their spending to ethical and sustainable businesses.</p><br /><h1><strong>ABOUT YOU:&nbsp;</strong></h1><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You are a clear-thinking, dynamic person who is equally happy bringing a strategic perspective to our operational scaling as getting your hands dirty keeping our books.&nbsp; You will thrive on a challenge and have initiative in spades.

We hire only the most brilliant professors and attorneys to write our content. But being a really smart lawyer just isn’t enough. Quimbee authors must be masters at breaking difficult concepts down and saying them simply. In this capacity, you will serve as, in effect, a legal educator. This is a position of great trust and responsibility. You are on the front lines, charged with ensuring that nothing but the highest quality content reaches Quimbee’s students.</p><p>Quimbee is looking for legal academics with strong subject-matter expertise in immigration law to write a comprehensive outline, designed to help law students prepare for classes and final exams, in that subject.&nbsp;<strong>We are considering a full-time or part-time hire on a limited, contract basis</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>with a view toward possible future work at the outline project’s conclusion. Depending on the details, we estimate that this project will take between three and five months to complete. However, we have a strong preference for someone who can dedicate at least 20 hours per week to this.</strong></p><p>As an author, you’ll work collaboratively with Quimbee’s editorial team to ensure that your work is the best it possibly can be.

You will build and grow the design organization, and collaborate with other executives to integrate design through an embedded model. You will advocate for design as a key stakeholder, maintain a high standard of work, and drive a consistent implementation of the brand both internally and externally.</p><p>HashiCorp is the multi-cloud infrastructure automation company. Our open source software is used by millions of users to provision, secure, connect, and run any infrastructure for any application. The Global 2000 uses our enterprise software to accelerate application delivery and drive innovation through software. We have a strong focus on the practitioner experience and treat it as our “true north.” Our Tao of HashiCorp highlights a workflow focus as being more important than technology, and this impacts deeply how we think about user experience. We are a highly distributed company as well, with employees located around the world. Our culture embraces autonomy and asynchronous work to support a global team.</p><p>We’re looking for a Head of Design who is excited about owning and evolving a highly visible brand in the technology community, and making HashiCorp recognized for its dedication to design excellence. The ideal leader is strategic, collaborative, and can scale with HashiCorp. Our brand needs to evolve with the business, and the design leader needs to develop and mentor a team who can scale to the various design challenges across the marketing and product portfolio.</p><p>This role would be a Senior Director or VP role, reporting directly to one of the co-founders in the Office of the CTO.

This is basically “The Right-Hand of the CTO”, as I need help with everything from speccing new tasks, testing tasks, answer questions from developers and even conceptualize new features.\\n\\nYOU DON’T HAVE TO BE ABLE TO CODE. However, It’s expected you’re the rare unicorn that is both technically very strong but also very good at communications, user experience and understands the business side of things.\\n\\nWhat are we doing:\\nSince we launched Likvido in April 2018, we’ve absolutely nailed it. Not only do we now have 1.000+ customers - among many of the hottest startups and scaleups in Denmark - we also managed to get very serious funding, have very good unit economics and built a really cool technical platform. However, we’re just getting started.\\n\\nSo what are we doing?\\nWe are solving the biggest reason for companies going bankrupt in Europe. You see, 19 % of all invoices are paid late, and roughly half of all bankruptcies are caused by lack of cash.\\n\\nLikvido is defining a new category we’re calling a “customer payment system”. Today you integrate Likvido with your accounting system, and then we automate sending out invoices, send our reminders, start debt collection and post back to the accounting system. Looking ahead, we will add financial products, give the whole organization access to our system and much more. In brief, we help companies get paid - on time - and forecast their cash flow.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n Your job responsibilities will be:\\n\\n- To maintain a high product quality, through both lots of testing of new features &amp; continuously improve everything we have live\\n- Ensure great performance by metrics such as: errors in logs, fast page-load, check request amounts\\n- Release management and making sure new code goes live (without problems)\\n- Help our CTO specify new tasks to our development team, and verify specification makes sense on all new tasks\\n- Help our development team with questions on features\\n- Be responsible for our internal IT support email\\n \\nTo make it concrete, during an average day, you could expect to do some of the following:\\n\\n- Testing a new feature made by a developer, and giving structured feedback (in Github)\\n- Checking website speed and amount of requests (in Azure)\\n- Testing a new release is ready to be rolled into production and then pulling the “release trigger!” (in Azure Devops)\\n- Reply to support tickets from our internal support department (in Intercom), and realize we have a bug, that you specify a solution for our development team (in Github)\\n- Help developers with questions about tasks (in Slack)\\n- Get a few hours to come up with some examples of how a new type of page could look (concept development) \\n\\n# Requirements\\nWe’re very open to your background, but the following is important to have in mind:\\n\\n- Fluent in English\\n- Some kind of formal education in business, economy, communication, IT or marketing is required\\n- You’re very detail oriented and structured\\n- You’re IT-savvy. You should be able to: 1) download development programs &amp; run applications from your computer 2) be open to learn SQL / databases if you don’t know it 3) use many different systems\\n- You have a Windows computer or are OK with installing Bootcamp and running Windows when you work. Parallels is not good enough\\n\\nA big part of the job is providing feedback to our developers by testing and speccing. It’s also extremely important that you’re able to quickly understand what we do, so you can help us improve the product. It’s a huge plus if you’ve worked with SaaS (software-as-a-service) before, or has worked in accounting systems.\\n\\nIt’s also worth noting that we’re a startup with big ambitions. This also come with big expectations. We don’t expect you to work crazy Silicon Valley hours, but you should also expect to work significantly more than 40 hours per work. \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

We are looking for a team-oriented, resourceful and self-motivated person to make an impact in a young, growing company.</p><p><strong>Job Purpose: Head of Finance</strong></p><p>Shield GEO provides outsourced employment and payroll for hundreds of employees in over 60 countries. Our Finance team is the engine that makes sure all our GEO employees get paid on time every month. The team collaborates closely with colleagues in Global Mobility, Subject Matter Experts and Implementation to ensure our clients have a great experience.</p><p>This is a broad reaching role as you’ll be responsible for the smooth operation and ongoing improvement of our three functions within finance. Our Operational team create invoices, process payments and generate payslips. Our SME team resolve issues and answer questions about international tax, payroll and finance. They also setup new GEO employees and process termination payrolls. And our Reporting team handle our internal payroll, company administration and reporting.</p><p>You’ll report directly to the company founders and be a key contributor to our leadership team. You’ll have plenty of support from your team leads, the operational and project teams, our systems and our technology platform. All employees at Shield have flexibility about when and where they work. Most of us choose to work remotely with flexible hours.</p><p><strong>Working with Shield</strong></p><p>If you are excited by the thought of playing an active role in a company that provides opportunities to create and innovate, you’re at the right place.</p><p>We’re a remote-friendly company with employees all around the world. We don’t want to be limited by location and are open to hiring anyone from anywhere as long as it’s a great fit for us and you. Before we get to know you, we’d like to give you a sense of who we are and what is important to us. We hope this helps you decide if you want to be a part of Shield GEO.</p><p>Every person is unique. At Shield GEO, we encourage an inclusive culture that embraces each individual’s differences. We believe that diversity of thought and experience is vital to generating creative ideas, developing effective strategies and making better decisions.</p><p>When hiring we do not discriminate by any unlawful means including, but not limited to, race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, age or veteran status.<br>We offer reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities wherever possible. Our employees are provided with the basic equipment required to give them a comfortable, safe and productive workplace. If you require additional equipment beyond our standard offering we are happy to work with you to try to find a solution.</p><p>We can’t quite show you what it’s like to work with us but you can hear from our employees themselves. Here’re some articles written by our Co-Founder, Customer Success Manager and Digital Marketing Manager.</p><ul><li>Working remotely and flexibly with Shield Geo</li><li>Leave policy</li><li>Work equipment policy</li><li>Workplace Diversity policy</li></ul><p><strong>Do you share our values?</strong></p><p>Our 4 values are integral to who we are. Our company culture is constantly evolving, every person who joins us adds something unique to our culture. But our values are shared by all Shield GEO employees. Do these values resonate with you?</p><p><strong>Grow</strong></p><p>We believe that personal growth and company growth go hand in hand. We look to foster our own growth and help grow the company. Every day is an opportunity to face a new challenge and get a little better. In our world of international employment it is impossible to know all the answers. Instead of trying to know everything, we focus on knowing how to solve problems. When mistakes happen we know it’s all part of the learning curve and we seek feedback to help us improve. We keep an eye on the big picture so we can identify improvements to processes and systems. As the problems become larger and more complex, it means that we’ll need more flexible and agile minds to come up with solutions.</p><p><strong>Own It</strong></p><p>We are self-motivated and love to see tasks to completion. Our managers and team mates are often in different time zones, and that’s ok! We aren’t afraid to step up when things get a little tough. We don’t like to micro-manage or <strong>be</strong> micromanaged. We trust our team mates to carry out their part of the process. We are responsible for our own workload and making sure we get our most important things done each day. If we get stuck we proactively seek help. And we show our reliability and accountability by keeping our systems updated. This also means our results can speak for themselves.</p><p><strong>Do The Right Thing</strong></p><p>Our clients trust us with compliance on their most important asset – their employees. This is a big responsibility! Doing the right thing means often times we choose a harder path and see it through to the end. It means we are open with our colleagues, clients and suppliers about bad news just the same as we share good news. And sometimes doing the right thing means we have to make decisions that will upset the very person we are trying to help. It’s a high standard but we stand by this very strongly. Doing the right thing also means considering how our actions impact those around us.</p><p><strong>Be Human</strong></p><p>We are a service business and helping people is at the core of everything we do. We pride ourselves on how we interact with colleagues, service providers and clients. We recognize that in all areas we’re dealing with real humans.</p><p>We know that working remotely and dealing with such a mix of people around the world is challenging. We know that if we are having trouble understanding someone, they are also struggling to understand us. Empathy is fundamental to helping us discover what people mean and how they are feeling. To avoid misinterpretation we assume best intent in others.</p><p>Because so much of our communication is written and asynchronous, we default to <em>over-communication</em>. This means we give extra details because we don’t leave people guessing. We make sure our words are clear and easy to understand. And we are kind to our fellow humans.</p><p><strong>Your Background</strong></p><ul><li>More than five years experience within Finance</li><li>More than five years experience in a leadership role</li><li>International tax or payroll experience required. You must be very familiar with concepts related to the employment and payroll of workers in multiple countries like; employer social security; foreign exchange; gross ups; and expense reimbursements.</li><li>Specific experience of employment and payroll in any of the following countries is an advantage; Australia; Canada; India; Singapore; UK; and USA.</li><li>Comfortable with technology.

That means video conferences and voice calls (Zoom), chat and messaging (Slack, Skype and Salesforce Chatter), shared documents (Dropbox). You’ll likely be working by yourself during parts of your day without access to tech support.</li><li>Experience with Salesforce or Xero is helpful but not essential.</li></ul><p><strong>Essential Characteristics of this role</strong></p><ul><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills and the ability to absorb information quickly. Because we are distributed across 9+ time zones and often working asynchronously clear and detailed written communication is particularly important.</li><li>Able to prioritize effectively and work autonomously while coordinating with an international team.</li><li>Able to both create and improve processes and workflows as well as coach your team on the same.</li><li>Exceptional attention to detail.</li><li>Ideally located between UTC+3 and UTC+8 time zones</li><li>Some flexibility in working hours.

Our company culture is constantly evolving, every person who joins us adds something unique to our culture. But our values are shared by all Shield GEO employees. Do these values resonate with you?<br><br></div><div>Grow<br><br></div><div>We believe that personal growth and company growth go hand in hand. We look to foster our own growth and help grow the company. Every day is an opportunity to face a new challenge and get a little better. In our world of international employment it is impossible to know all the answers. Instead of trying to know everything, we focus on knowing how to solve problems. When mistakes happen we know it’s all part of the learning curve and we seek feedback to help us improve. We keep an eye on the big picture so we can identify improvements to processes and systems. As the problems become larger and more complex, it means that we’ll need more flexible and agile minds to come up with solutions.<br><br></div><div>Own It<br><br></div><div>We are self-motivated and love to see tasks to completion. Our managers and team mates are often in different time zones, and that’s ok! We aren’t afraid to step up when things get a little tough. We don’t like to micro-manage or <strong>be</strong> micromanaged. We trust our team mates to carry out their part of the process. We are responsible for our own workload and making sure we get our most important things done each day. If we get stuck we proactively seek help. And we show our reliability and accountability by keeping our systems updated. This also means our results can speak for themselves.<br><br></div><div>Do The Right Thing<br><br></div><div>Our clients trust us with compliance on their most important asset - their employees. This is a big responsibility! Doing the right thing means often times we choose a harder path and see it through to the end. It means we are open with our colleagues, clients and suppliers about bad news just the same as we share good news. And sometimes doing the right thing means we have to make decisions that will upset the very person we are trying to help. It’s a high standard but we stand by this very strongly. Doing the right thing also means considering how our actions impact those around us.<br><br></div><div>Be Human<br><br></div><div>We are a service business and helping people is at the core of everything we do. We pride ourselves on how we interact with colleagues, service providers and clients. We recognize that in all areas we’re dealing with real humans.<br><br></div><div>We know that working remotely and dealing with such a mix of people around the world is challenging. We know that if we are having trouble understanding someone, they are also struggling to understand us. Empathy is fundamental to helping us discover what people mean and how they are feeling. To avoid misinterpretation we assume best intent in others.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Because so much of our communication is written and asynchronous, we default to <em>over-communication</em>. This means we give extra details because we don’t leave people guessing. We make sure our words are clear and easy to understand. And we are kind to our fellow humans.<br><br></div><div><br>Your Background<br><br></div><ul><li>More than five years experience within Finance</li><li>More than five years experience in a leadership role</li><li>International tax or payroll experience required.

Drops is one of the top10 most innovative education companies according to FastCompany. Our app is in the Appstore for 3+ years, teaches 32 languages, was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times - App of the Year in 2018 on the Play Store - and the company is still run by the founders. We are a small, super-capable remote team mainly spread across Europe (we have a small marketing crew in California) . We’re working synchronously, so time zones matter for us. We communicate via Slack, Github and Monday. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 15 million, a monthly active of &gt;1,500,000 and an average store rating of 4.7.\\n\\nYou can find us here: http://drops.app.link/\\n\\n\\n**What’d be different here:\\n**\\n* We’re a small team. We’re optimising for impact, not for headcount. You’ll be carefully considering any tradeoff that would lead to increased complexity.\\n* We’re using a single programming language - TypeScript.
