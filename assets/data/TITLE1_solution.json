We are looking for an experienced security engineer to help us identify the biggest IR opportunities and to work with our security and IT teams to build solutions that address those opportunities.</p><p><strong>Who we are</strong></p><p>The Tech team is a small, diverse team that develops and supports the technology used by candidates and organizers in all 50 states and all 3,413 counties across the United States to analyze data, organize campaigns, raise money, and get out the vote on election day.</p><p>But there’s more to do. So we’re hiring product managers, engineers, researchers, designers, security experts, IT professionals, and data scientists who can use user-centered design and rapid iteration to develop a rich technology ecosystem for progressives—building tools ourselves as well as partnering with other companies and organizations.</p><p><strong>Do you want to…</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Secure the future of our country?&nbsp;</strong>Right now a lot is at stake in our country and our team has a huge opportunity to make a real difference.</li><li><strong>Work with amazing people?</strong>&nbsp;We’re building a diverse, distributed team, hiring the best people we can wherever they are—alumni from past Presidential campaigns working out of DC and New York, experienced product developers from the SF Bay Area, and more.</li><li><strong>Never stop learning?</strong>&nbsp;There are people who know about politics and people who know about technology and a few who have figured out some things about how to combine the two, but we are blazing a lot of new trails and you should be comfortable exploring and learning from everyone you can.</li></ul><p><strong>You will…</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Lead</strong>&nbsp;efforts around log aggregation and analysis, incident detection, response, and recovery</li><li><strong>Deploy and maintain&nbsp;</strong>security systems in production</li><li><strong>Automate</strong>&nbsp;routine tasks through coding</li><li><strong>Evolve</strong>&nbsp;our incident response plans and protocols</li><li><strong>Provide actionable metrics</strong>&nbsp;to keep the work on track</li></ul><p>We are looking for a hands-on incident response engineer who can evolve our IR processes and technologies in light of today’s threat landscape. You’ll take our existing systems and processes and mature them in close partnership with other security engineers, system administrators, executives, and legal team members. You’ll develop ways to test our response capabilities through use of various tools, as well as through projects with red teams. You’ll use your previous experience with Linux, desktop OSs, Splunk, IOT, and coding on a routine basis. Other useful skills include threat modeling, risk management, threat hunting, and security frameworks like NIST CSF.</p><p>We don’t require previous experience in politics. If you are coming from industry, however, be aware that some things are different in the world of politics: while we’ve done some budget hacking so we can be competitive when it comes to salaries we know we can’t beat Google or Facebook. On the other hand, you might legit help save the world.</p><p>The Democratic National Committee (DNC), is committed to diversity among its staff, and recognizes that its continued success requires the highest commitment to obtaining and retaining a diverse staff that provides the best quality services to supporters and constituents.

You build and maintain helm charts that might start out as a special project for one customer and end up being a managed service run by all our customers.</li></ul><ul><li>You hold trainings and workshops at conferences, for our existing customers, as well as with Giant Swarm’s potential customers. . &nbsp;Do note that the role requires minimum travel as most of our interactions as a fully remote company are via video conferencing.<br><br></li><li>Learn from customer's problems with moving to microservices architectures, get your hands dirty and find out what Cloud Native project's entrails look like. The more successful our customers are with the Cloud Native journey, the more successful we are.</li></ul><ul><li>Ultimately, you are also responsible for documentation, helping the product teams implement fixes, prioritizing features and making sure we only need to answer questions once.<br><br></li><li>First impressions are important! You help create a great onboarding experience for our customers and become the main point of contact for them.</li></ul><ul><li>To sum it up: Customer Success is all that matters. Within the solution engineering team, we make sure our customers are happy and taking the right steps going forward, at best you anticipate the problems they might face in the future.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Requirements:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>You have experience with more than one programming language, including Go, and a strong architectural background.</li></ul><ul><li>You feel at home in the Kubernetes world, especially the multitude of Open Source tools around Kubernetes and the Container World.</li></ul><ul><li>You can explain complicated things concisely and easily for a diverse audience.</li></ul><ul><li>You have a strong sense in providing an awesome customer service that makes life easier for Developers. Your communication skills (especially written form) are excellent. Very good English skills are a must-have. German skills are a bonus.</li></ul><ul><li>You are open to attend conferences with our team and hold talks in front of customers. You are happy to travel 5-10% per year</li></ul><ul><li>We (and our customers) are currently mostly distributed around Europe (around UTC), thus, your main timezone should be somewhere between -2UTC to +2UTC to ensure better communication.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Why we think this position is worth applying for (challenge us!)</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Impact, Impact, Impact! We are a growing team (from 15+ European countries) and every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.</li></ul><ul><li>“It's better to ask forgiveness than permission” (Paolini) - sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things like in the guidebook. Hell, our customers choose us because we are building how the guidebook should look in this day and age. You can try things out.</li></ul><ul><li>We play a key role in our customer's digital transformation. We have partnered up with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to provide our solution on their cloud platforms - more will follow.</li></ul><ul><li>We serve some of Europe's leading organisations and are talking to many more.</li></ul>                </div>                        <h3>About Giant Swarm GmbH</h3>            <div><p><strong><strong>What is it like to work at Giant Swarm?</strong></strong></p><p>We would like to give you a glimpse on how working with <a href='http://giantswarm.io/' rel='nofollow'>Giant Swarm</a> (we are a fully remote team) is like:</p><p><strong><strong>Self-organization</strong></strong></p><p>Creative work needs freedom and openness. We encourage you to do your work wherever (some of us travel almost half the year and work from remote islands) and whenever you want (keeping in mind that there are some meetings we would like you to attend). We expect passion and encourage sustainability. If you need rest, take it. If you take up a task, own it. If you see a problem, solve it.</p><p><strong><strong>Teamwork</strong></strong></p><p>We are a growing company with team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible. Always question the status quo and find new ways of collaboration and team work.</p><p><strong><strong>Learning</strong></strong></p><p>Learning is mandatory and fun at the same time. If you realise you want to expand your knowledge in a specific area, we support you with conferences, books etc.</p><p><strong><strong>Basics</strong></strong></p><p>We offer fair (transparent and open) salaries with benefits like choosing your own laptop, your choice to work at home or in a coworking space, flexible hours, minimal meetings, transparent communication, etc.. And you will participate in our stock options program. Currently our team members have more children than we are employees. So family friendliness is a must.</p><p>We don't hire job descriptions.

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

This is a hybrid role between senior sales lead and a solutions architect. In this role at Modern Tribe you will help the company identify leads, develop relationships and close deals in line with our company values.</div><div><br></div><div>The ideal candidate for this role is someone who has been writing proposals, selling large scale projects and maintaining key relationships for a successful digital agency for 3+ years and has been technically involved in online projects for 5+ years.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ve been running projects for years: you’ve done your own sales, have a proven track record writing proposals that close deals, know how to work with WordPress, and understand the nuances of the WordPress business world. You’ve sold projects in the $75 – $250k+ range, and aren’t afraid to go bigger.</div><div><br></div><div>Above all else, your daily attitude + output embody Modern Tribe’s company ethos of “live well and do good work”: you thrive on keeping the team happy and healthy. Matchmaking — not hitting sales numbers — is your jam. You hustle hard, enjoy the game and relish a genuine success. We pride ourselves on solving real problems for people rather than clutter the interwebs with more shit. If you jive with the mission of setting your team up for success, giving them the right flow and the right kind of projects, even if it means rejecting a potentially-lucrative gig…we’d love to hear from you.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Note that this is not an account management role and scoping + strategy experience are a must-have for this role. Modern Tribe is ONLY looking for technical sales candidates at this time.</span><span></span></div><div><h3><span><span><b>Inclusion Statement</b></span></span></h3></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Modern Tribe is committed to a culture that embraces diversity and inclusion.

To put it simply, they are an award-winning organisation, market leaders in their field with an excellent reputation for providing high-quality and scalable solutions for their customers.</p><p>They are well known in numerous technology channels (e.g. Microsoft, Salesforce, Big Data, Cloud, Java) and their goal is to provide a consistently high level of service to a diverse set of customers, working collaboratively at all times to ensure smooth and pain-free transformations. They have offices all over the UK and offer an excellent benefits package, alongside the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects in both the public and private sectors.</p><p><strong>The journey continues</strong> with the role, part of a huge recruitment drive planned for early 2019 and part of the organisation’s ‘Architectural Strategy’ function. This function focuses on bespoke application development and Cloud transformations, with the main crux of the work being Agile software integrations on an enterprise scale.</p><p>As a Senior Solutions Architect, you will be primarily focused on developing and delivering solutions for both internal and external clients. </p><p>You will combine deep understanding and experience of shaping integration solutions with the personal skills and credibility to lead and guide some of the best technical teams in the business to successful delivery. You will take accountability for ensuring that the end-to-end integration solutions they create for their customers fulfil their expectations of high quality and cost-effectiveness. </p><p>Additionally, you will be able to demonstrate CXO-facing experience in shaping IT integration technology deployment and governance. You will also have a keen understanding of commercial cost models and the business benefit value derived from their customer’s investment in integration technology.</p><p><em>The role will require flexibility around mobility and UK-wide travel, with you essentially working on customer site x3 days per week with x2 day per week home based. They will endeavour to ensure that you are based within the M25 Corridor area 80% of the time, but this cannot always be 100% guaranteed for obvious reasons so this is something you need to be aware of.</em></p><p><strong>The journey draws to a close</strong> with the requirements… which are pretty diverse! So in order to truly get the most out of this role, you’ll bring some of the following skills to the table:</p><p><strong><em>E2E Architecture</em> – </strong>you should have a fundamental understanding of Enterprise Architecture, Solutions Architecture and E2E Solutions Design. You should be able to work across various designs/methods (N-Tier, SOA, Microservices etc.), with any industry certifications (e.g. TOGAF) being a huge bonus.</p><p><em><strong>Integration Experience</strong></em> – you must also have proven experience delivering integration projects, including working with tools such as Mulesoft, Apache, Del Boomi, Tibco etc.</p><p><em><strong>Stakeholder Management</strong></em> – due to the nature of this organisation (e.g. a customer-facing consultancy), you should have a proven track record both managing and influencing c-level stakeholders throughout the delivery lifecycle.</p><p><em><strong>Software Development Background</strong> </em>– it is crucial that you have a background in Software Development and Software Architecture due to the nature of this role, so this wouldn’t suit Infrastructure Architects or Data Architects. You should have an understanding of the full Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ideally with previous exposure to Microsoft/Open Source development, APIs and Cloud (AWS, Azure) technology.</p><p>Finally, the journey ends with you… i.e. how you decide to proceed.</p><p>If you decide you want to proceed to a chat, then give me a shout. You can call me on either <strong></strong> or <strong></strong>.</p><p>Alternatively, send me an email to <strong></strong> or drop me a LinkedIn message by searching for <strong>‘Liam Haghighat’.</strong></p><p>However, if you feel this role isn’t right for you then I wish you the best of luck with the remainder of your job search!</p><p><em><strong>Anything discussed in relation to this advert will remain confidential and fully compliant with GDPR.</strong></em></p><p></p></div><p></p><strong>Salary :</strong> <p>Minimum:<br>Maximum:<br>Currency: British Pound .

Our goal is to deliver contemporary web applications to an industry mired in late 90’s technology.

This is an exciting opportunity to use your experience helping the IOSS mission. The mission of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Office of Information &amp; Technology (OI&amp;T), Information Technology (IT) Operations and Services (ITOPS), Infrastructure Operations (IO) is to support One VA world-class service to Veterans and their families by delivering results-oriented, secure, highly available, and cost-effective information technology services. IO support helps to provide critical services focusing on consistent availability of Veteran-facing applications and quick delivery of benefits for Veterans.</p><p><strong>Primary Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Perform support services within the ITOPS IO Security Management Division. This division is charged with establishing a centralized security program to address security with ITOPS IO’s projects. Some security tasks are currently accomplished utilizing various tools, technologies, and processes that are not standardized across ITOPS (i.e. AITC, HITC, PITC, QITC, CITC, Regional Data Centers, Business Partner Extensions, External Cloud environments). Not all IT security functions are currently managed under a standardized set of processes and technologies or in a centralized format. In some cases, more than one process exists for a single function, i.e. access requests. In other cases, while a process or security system exists, its use is not commonplace at all applicable sites.</p><p><strong>Technical Security Support</strong></p><p>The data center environment requires additional coverage to manage the security tools and the growing technical security responsibilities across ITOPS IO in order to secure Veterans’ data and important VA systems 24x7x365. The ITOPS IO approved Security Monitoring product support process is to deploy a three-shift Technical Security Section for 24x7x365. <strong>The Contractor</strong> shall provide 24x7x365 support services coverage. The Technical Security support is to be centralized at AITC with tools implemented across ITOPS.</p><p>Keep security tools tuned and coordinated with the necessary security posture within ITOPS, and any other locations identified. The support services required include analyzing current security tools and datacenter environments to ensure all security environments needing attention get the attention required per policy and customization needed with the different applications or datacenter solutions. Handle critical/important day-to-day Change Order management and ITOPS IO project involvement. Handle current and future security tool architecture design.</p><p>The ITOPS IO Technical Security group relies on advanced tuning of existing IT security products to detect, protect and forward critical security alerts to the ITOPS IO Security Monitoring group, Nation Service Desk (NSD), Information Security Officers (ISOs) and the VA National Security Operations Center (NSOC) on alerts related to VA compliance policy violations, Advanced Persistent Threats (APT’s). Forensics and any other IT Security related issues that need 24x7x365 support.</p><p>The ITOPS IO security network will be interconnected among the different data centers (i.e. AITC, HITC, PITC, QITC, CITC, Regional Data Centers, Business Partner Extensions, External Cloud environments) in a separate private security network. Each data center’s security network will be separated by a firewall to only allow other data center security network connectivity using VA’s existing network. This allows for the separation of environments to keep event log data as required by policy to where only designated INFOSEC personnel have access into this security network from the various ITOPS IO network locations. This ITOPS IO Information Technology Center (ITC) security network will also provide the redundancy needed for security network and security tool availability. ITOPS IO security tool standardization will be implemented along with the technical security processes that are in place at AITC. The redundancy for each ITC will include Intrusion Protection Systems / Intrusion Detection Systems (IPS/IDS), vulnerability and compliance assessment tools, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Web Application Firewall (WAF), dedicated malware protection architecture, Network Access Control (NAC), virtualization security, and the core infrastructure for the security network along with ITC technical security personnel to overlap and provide the 24x7x365 support needed. Incident response procedures and processes at all datacenters are to be unified to complement the security incident response process that the rest of VA uses, including integrating with the NSOC and Field Security. Incident tracking is performed using the NSD and Remedy.</p><p>The centralization of security tools, processes and incident handling provides the in-depth security posture and metric information needed for the datacenter environments. Standardizing on these tools may require additional training for other security staff at the sites.</p><p><strong>In support of these Technical Security efforts, perform the following tasks daily:</strong></p><ul><li>Perform assessments and compliance activities using central managed vulnerability scan engines to perform operating systems, network devices, databases and applications assessments.</li><li>Perform collection and analysis of all operating systems logs, network device logs, network flows, intrusion prevention and intrusion detection, vulnerability assessment, network firewall, web application firewall and virtual environment logs and provide centralized correlation, alerting, log archiving, asset discovery and behavior analysis configuration using an IBM QRadar Security Information and Event Manager (SIEM) or equivalent.</li><li>Perform real-time network and system protection, detection and log analysis using Sourcefire Intrusion Prevention System/Intrusion Detection System (IPS/IDS) or equivalent sensors centrally managed with Sourcefire Defense Center console or equivalent providing network awareness and vulnerability intelligence.</li><li>Perform web application vulnerability assessments and reporting using web application assessment software, which also provides web application security intelligence to the Web Application Firewall solution.</li><li>Perform real-time web application protection against SQL injection attacks, malicious bots, zero-day attacks, data loss and defacement protection and any other Web Application attacks that exist including Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance using Web Application Firewall technology. PCI compliance and reporting is performed by VA.</li><li>Perform end user device threat containment and access control to ensure VA security policies and restrictions in the Information Technology Center network using Network Access Control technology are adhered.</li><li>Perform real-time network and system malware protection, detection and log analysis using Malware Protection System.</li><li>Prepare and conduct status briefings and resolve issues in support of senior managers and VA leadership upon request from COR/VA PMs.</li><li>Review and maintain Standard Operating Procedures for the Intrusion Prevention Systems Intrusion Detection Systems (IPS/IDS), Security Information and Event Manager (SIEM), Vulnerability assessments using Tenable Security Center or equivalent, Incident Response, Web Application Firewall (WAF), VMware or equivalent, Network Admission Control Systems (NAC), Malware Protection System (MPS) and any other ITOPS IO Technical Security activities and processes that may need SOP’s reviewed and maintained.</li></ul><p><strong>Security Analytics</strong></p><p>ITOPS IO Technical Security Service Line provides IT Security threat reporting and analytics on IPS/IDS, SIEM, Web Application Firewall (WAF), Malware Protection System (MPS), Network Admission Control Systems (NAC) and IT Security threat information to ITOPS IO, ITOPS IO customer and other VA national groups.
