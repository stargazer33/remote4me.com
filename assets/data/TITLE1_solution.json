You build and maintain helm charts that might start out as a special project for one customer and end up being a managed service run by all our customers.</li></ul><ul><li>You hold trainings and workshops at conferences, for our existing customers, as well as with Giant Swarm’s potential customers. . &nbsp;Do note that the role requires minimum travel as most of our interactions as a fully remote company are via video conferencing.<br><br></li><li>Learn from customer's problems with moving to microservices architectures, get your hands dirty and find out what Cloud Native project's entrails look like. The more successful our customers are with the Cloud Native journey, the more successful we are.</li></ul><ul><li>Ultimately, you are also responsible for documentation, helping the product teams implement fixes, prioritizing features and making sure we only need to answer questions once.<br><br></li><li>First impressions are important! You help create a great onboarding experience for our customers and become the main point of contact for them.</li></ul><ul><li>To sum it up: Customer Success is all that matters. Within the solution engineering team, we make sure our customers are happy and taking the right steps going forward, at best you anticipate the problems they might face in the future.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Requirements:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>You have experience with more than one programming language, including Go, and a strong architectural background.</li></ul><ul><li>You feel at home in the Kubernetes world, especially the multitude of Open Source tools around Kubernetes and the Container World.</li></ul><ul><li>You can explain complicated things concisely and easily for a diverse audience.</li></ul><ul><li>You have a strong sense in providing an awesome customer service that makes life easier for Developers. Your communication skills (especially written form) are excellent. Very good English skills are a must-have. German skills are a bonus.</li></ul><ul><li>You are open to attend conferences with our team and hold talks in front of customers. You are happy to travel 5-10% per year</li></ul><ul><li>We (and our customers) are currently mostly distributed around Europe (around UTC), thus, your main timezone should be somewhere between -2UTC to +2UTC to ensure better communication.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Why we think this position is worth applying for (challenge us!)</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Impact, Impact, Impact! We are a growing team (from 15+ European countries) and every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.</li></ul><ul><li>“It's better to ask forgiveness than permission” (Paolini) - sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things like in the guidebook. Hell, our customers choose us because we are building how the guidebook should look in this day and age. You can try things out.</li></ul><ul><li>We play a key role in our customer's digital transformation. We have partnered up with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to provide our solution on their cloud platforms - more will follow.</li></ul><ul><li>We serve some of Europe's leading organisations and are talking to many more.</li></ul>                </div>                        <h4>About Giant Swarm GmbH</h4>            <div><p><strong><strong>What is it like to work at Giant Swarm?</strong></strong></p><p>We would like to give you a glimpse on how working with <a href='http://giantswarm.io/' rel='nofollow'>Giant Swarm</a> (we are a fully remote team) is like:</p><p><strong><strong>Self-organization</strong></strong></p><p>Creative work needs freedom and openness.

If you see a problem, solve it.</p><p><strong><strong>Teamwork</strong></strong></p><p>We are a growing company with team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible. Always question the status quo and find new ways of collaboration and team work.</p><p><strong><strong>Learning</strong></strong></p><p>Learning is mandatory and fun at the same time. If you realise you want to expand your knowledge in a specific area, we support you with conferences, books etc.</p><p><strong><strong>Basics</strong></strong></p><p>We offer fair (transparent and open) salaries with benefits like choosing your own laptop, your choice to work at home or in a coworking space, flexible hours, minimal meetings, transparent communication, etc..

    "content": "<div><p>This is a full-time permanent work from home Solutions/Data Architect who has a desire to work for a database software company in a post-sales role in their professional services division, working with customers and clients REMOTLEY. The appeal is quality of life, work from home and still able to work in professional services and not be a road warrior. Most professional services organizations have their employees traveling Monday Friday each week, that is not the case here.</p><p><strong>About the Company:</strong></p><p>Our client is a company you will know of well. They make a database. The difference is that they are a key value database, NOSQL Database, and they offer the lowest total cost of ownership among any database competitors out there, they give you performance at scale.</p><p>All industries that need access to real time data (we are talking 100 s of terabytes). One customer (as an example), was using a competitor (an opensource product), they had 30 terabytes of data, they had 500 servers that they needed to run their data. But when our client looked at the problem and modeled it out they only needed 60 servers and we were faster in returning data, basically 10 millisecond read type operations. The deployment ended up being 43 servers vs 500 competitor servers. The customer saved on an operational basis 2 million dollars a year. Those operational costs were big, and their performance is better than any other databases. It is a hot technology, and this is why they are growing.</p><p>They put a strong emphasis on making sure their software architecture and their database architecture are correct so it can scale. They have customers that come in and start with 10 terabytes and 12 months later they are running a 100-200 terabytes of data, so that architecture has to be able to scale and so there is a lot of data modeling that goes into that, there is a lot of understanding software design patterns.</p><p><strong>Profile</strong>:</p><p>The best people for this job would be Data Architects, Database Architects or Senior Data Engineers who have realized they are really good with helping customers succeed. It would be easy to just hire a technical person for this role, but often times they don t put enough thought into methodology for customer success or they don t really enjoy running customer projects.</p><p>The level of this role is architecture level (high level e.g. Solutions Architect). We are looking for systems design, understanding the end to end software development process and all the pieces, people who have run projects including running the development, the DevOps, the design, the BA stuff, etc.</p><p>NOSQL experience would be nice to have. is important because the way our client solves the use case in NOSQL is so different than in the relational world and people who haven t been exposed to how they model the data in NOSQL, there is just a learning curve that we want someone to have already gone through.</p><p>If someone doesn t have DevOps/operations side, it wouldn t be a deal killer. But if they understand general DevOps pipelines, all the tools that are play in that space, Kubernetes, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, that would be nice. The reason is that they are working with their customers to deploy into their infrastructure and their customers are using these tools and you need to help them understand how to fit the software into those landscapes and into those pipelines and that is part of what they do for our customers.</p><p><strong>Day in Life:</strong></p><p>Some of what you will do once a customer is onboarded is to indentify metrics, what they are trying to accomplish, their objectives, you introduce them to the training functions, you design a training program, meaning you look at their job function and figure out what courses in the course catalogue they need to take and make sure they complete their product certification. Next, you ADOPT the sofware into their production environment. There are 8 steps that take place: Software architecture review, data model exercise, capacity planning exercise, there is a number of things that go through on architecture and similarly on the DevOps side. There is a checklist of things that include looking at their pipeline, advising how to write scripts if they are using something like ansible, how do they script into our software, what are the recommendations, what are the best practices, you look at their disaster recovery plans, how are they backing up data, how are they restoring it, how are they testing that, then you go into the testing side, which is functional tests, performance tests, how they are going to validate if the software is up and working, all those things occur when they launch, and you are that technical resource to make sure all those things are done right.</p><p>Other companies call this a Technical Account Manager. If you have been a TAM you will understand what they do and how they work. You work with that customer team every week, work on operations issue, architecture issues, you are a liaison between support, you build relationships with customers, you are one of the reason why the customer expands because they know you are there to help them answer questions and ensure they are successful. It is a strong consultant who can play that role well.</p><p>The data experience is good, but it is more important that they understand these enterprise software systems and how they operate with each other. And multi-database, we aren t just looking for some MySQL or some web applications, it s actual different databases, enterprise databases, NoSQL, etc.</p><p>If someone has Cassandra, that would be great because that s scale. Or if we could find people with NoSQL or Cloud: CouchDB, MongoDB, Redis, Cosmos DB, DynamoDB.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p> - provided by Dice</div>",

    "content": "<div>\n Position: Solution Sales Manager - SalesSchedule: Full-Time / RemoteReports To: Director of Sales OperationsSalary: Base Pay + Commission Overview: Nomad Global Communications Solutions is a leading provider of communication and response products serving a wide variety of customers. Our purpose is to be the solution when every second matters. We seek a candidate that is self-inspired to learn and demonstrates a high degree of customer service while positively contributing to our team. The Solution Sales Manager position is a hybrid role combining elements of sales, business development, account management, customer service and research into a single position. Successful candidates will be highly motivated, self-directed, eager to learn, and comfortable with some ambiguity while determining what it takes to successfully grow a line-of-business. The SSM reports to and works closely with the Director of Sales and the entire sales team. The position also requires successful cross-functional interaction with many groups for sales execution including: Project Management, Engineering, Procurement, Operations, and Finance. Please do not apply for this position if you do not meet the minimum qualifications for this job as sales/business development is not transactional sales and customer service. If all your experience is in transactional sales and you can't articulate and show proof of business/relationship development success, please don't apply. If you want a list of existing clients to call on, we're not for you. We like people who are not afraid to ask questions. If you are self-directed and motivated, you may be a good match. If you are not at least a mildly avid reader, you'll probably struggle in this role. We delete boring résumés and cover letters at the first opportunity, so take a few minutes, stand out and let us know why you are the critical component missing from our team. We believe strongly in metrics and measurement, so if you are used to coasting in your role and hiding in the shadows, you won't like it here. But if you thrive in an independent environment, are adept at relationship building and love to lead, we want to know who you are. We have a sincere appreciation for out of the box thinking, humor and creativity, so make us laugh, send your résumé via a singing telegram or do something different to stand out from the multitudes of résumés that we receive. If you are not on LinkedIn, you've got a tough hill to climb with us, but in the same vein, if you have 2000+ contacts, we wonder if you spend way too much time on LinkedIn. However, if you are excited about an opportunity to grow a product line with huge potential, backed by one of the most respected names in the industry, you just might like it here. You will have to travel, interface with a wide variety of people and quickly get up to speed, but the right person will thrive in this role. But know that we won't settle for just anybody. We've got a great team in place and we're not willing to mess that up. If you have your wits about you and understand sales/business development, you'll be able to sift through this information and realize the key components that we are looking to hire. Be sure to let us know in your cover letter what the last book you read was and why you chose it. This position has plenty of room for growth, and won't keep you behind a desk all week. In fact, if you find yourself behind a desk all week, you're likely to get fired. We believe that relationships matter and hope you do too as that is at the core of our business model. So if this all sounds good, we'd love to meet you. But please, don't just send us the boring old cover letter and résumé that you just sent to 100 other companies. Essential Functions / Responsibilities: Drive growth through new business generation. This position will likely focus on the Law Enforcement/Emergency Management markets.Perform ongoing research with a focus on utilizing various lead generation services and tactics to generate sales (meetings, Google Alerts, blogs, etc.).Interpret and share customer insights with Marketing and other departments.Provide market feedback to leadership regarding competitive offerings as well as generate their own new business.Perform ongoing research with a focus on identifying contacts, sales leads, and identify the top 100 LE/EM customers and achieve a minimum conversion rate.Work to understand everything you can about mobile connectivity and related technologies while identifying other markets that are underserved by Nomad.Respond promptly to inbound sales and product inquiries generated by phone, website traffic, lead generation services, etc.Attend trade shows and other industry events to represent Nomad, generate leads, and to reinforce/enhance the company's reputation. Travel required.Become a trusted advisor with customers by learning their businesses, challenges, and risks.Build and manage a pipeline of sales opportunities needed to achieve monthly/annual revenue objectives.Learn and understand the Nomad sales methods, processes and procedures to provide frictionless customer experience.Prepare quarterly reports on the status, plans, challenges, next steps, and key growth opportunities within your business focus. Qualifications &amp; Experience: Excellent organizational, communication, telephone and interpersonal skills.Professional verbal and written communication style.Must have a high level of emotional intelligence to include: demonstrating empathy, benefitting from criticism, keeping commitments, being quick to apologize, and taking the time to pause.Self-starter comfortable with figuring things out as you go and comfortable with ambiguity, but confident to lead.Exceptional work habits with the ability to work independently and successfully in a team environment.High energy team player with a &quot;can do&quot; attitude and bias towards action.Proficient using standard business software including ERP, CRM, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and some Adobe CS products.\n <p>by Jobble</p>\n</div>",
