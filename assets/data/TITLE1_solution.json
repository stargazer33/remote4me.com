    "content": "<div>\n Position: Solution Sales Manager - SalesSchedule: Full-Time / RemoteReports To: Director of Sales OperationsSalary: Base Pay + Commission Overview: Nomad Global Communications Solutions is a leading provider of communication and response products serving a wide variety of customers. Our purpose is to be the solution when every second matters. We seek a candidate that is self-inspired to learn and demonstrates a high degree of customer service while positively contributing to our team. The Solution Sales Manager position is a hybrid role combining elements of sales, business development, account management, customer service and research into a single position. Successful candidates will be highly motivated, self-directed, eager to learn, and comfortable with some ambiguity while determining what it takes to successfully grow a line-of-business. The SSM reports to and works closely with the Director of Sales and the entire sales team. The position also requires successful cross-functional interaction with many groups for sales execution including: Project Management, Engineering, Procurement, Operations, and Finance. Please do not apply for this position if you do not meet the minimum qualifications for this job as sales/business development is not transactional sales and customer service. If all your experience is in transactional sales and you can't articulate and show proof of business/relationship development success, please don't apply. If you want a list of existing clients to call on, we're not for you. We like people who are not afraid to ask questions. If you are self-directed and motivated, you may be a good match. If you are not at least a mildly avid reader, you'll probably struggle in this role. We delete boring résumés and cover letters at the first opportunity, so take a few minutes, stand out and let us know why you are the critical component missing from our team. We believe strongly in metrics and measurement, so if you are used to coasting in your role and hiding in the shadows, you won't like it here. But if you thrive in an independent environment, are adept at relationship building and love to lead, we want to know who you are. We have a sincere appreciation for out of the box thinking, humor and creativity, so make us laugh, send your résumé via a singing telegram or do something different to stand out from the multitudes of résumés that we receive. If you are not on LinkedIn, you've got a tough hill to climb with us, but in the same vein, if you have 2000+ contacts, we wonder if you spend way too much time on LinkedIn. However, if you are excited about an opportunity to grow a product line with huge potential, backed by one of the most respected names in the industry, you just might like it here. You will have to travel, interface with a wide variety of people and quickly get up to speed, but the right person will thrive in this role. But know that we won't settle for just anybody. We've got a great team in place and we're not willing to mess that up. If you have your wits about you and understand sales/business development, you'll be able to sift through this information and realize the key components that we are looking to hire. Be sure to let us know in your cover letter what the last book you read was and why you chose it. This position has plenty of room for growth, and won't keep you behind a desk all week. In fact, if you find yourself behind a desk all week, you're likely to get fired. We believe that relationships matter and hope you do too as that is at the core of our business model. So if this all sounds good, we'd love to meet you. But please, don't just send us the boring old cover letter and résumé that you just sent to 100 other companies.

This position will likely focus on the Law Enforcement/Emergency Management markets.Perform ongoing research with a focus on utilizing various lead generation services and tactics to generate sales (meetings, Google Alerts, blogs, etc.).Interpret and share customer insights with Marketing and other departments.Provide market feedback to leadership regarding competitive offerings as well as generate their own new business.Perform ongoing research with a focus on identifying contacts, sales leads, and identify the top 100 LE/EM customers and achieve a minimum conversion rate.Work to understand everything you can about mobile connectivity and related technologies while identifying other markets that are underserved by Nomad.Respond promptly to inbound sales and product inquiries generated by phone, website traffic, lead generation services, etc.Attend trade shows and other industry events to represent Nomad, generate leads, and to reinforce/enhance the company's reputation.

We’re looking for a collaborative but hands-on Solutions Architect to help us scale our execution to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p>\n <p>Analytics Fire is a deeply technical engineering organization. Most of us are software engineers and spend the majority of our time on heads down engineering activities like coding. Our goal in creating this position is to expand our small client-facing team with a unique person that has both the personality and the technical skill set to collaborate directly with clients and senior members of the technical team in order to help steer technical decision making and requirements gathering, especially early in the project lifecycle.</p>\n <p>This position is similar to that of a technical Program Manager, but you will be much more involved in the technical details and hurdles around software architecture than a traditional Project Manager would be. Our ideal candidate is a current or former full stack Software Engineer that is willing to be trained in formal Program Management processes (or has already been trained in formal Program Management processes).</p>\n <p>As a small company, Analytics Fire is able to tailor roles around the strengths of our individual team members. We will tailor this role to your specific technical background. However, it is a hard requirement that you are able to support the following 3 types of responsibilities:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>(a) Represent Analytics Fire software engineering teams in client-facing interactions (and sometimes interactions with potential clients)</li>\n  <li>(b) Technical writing responsibilities such as documenting requirements, project plans, system architecture, etc.</li>\n  <li>(c) Making meaningful contributions to the execution of complex software projects.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>For reference, here is a list of some technologies we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>JavaScript: React / Angular /&nbsp;Typescript / GraphQL</li>\n  <li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node</li>\n  <li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li>\n  <li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li>\n  <li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li>\n  <li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li>\n  <li>Other technologies we are currently building with: AWS, GCP, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Yocto, Salesforce platform, iOS, ARKit</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Your primary responsibility will be to assist in guiding new projects through sales, planning, development, and deployment. This will be accomplished through a combination of client interactions, technical writing, and participation in formal sales, program management, and engineering related processes. Your contributions will naturally be slightly front-loaded towards the sales and planning phases, however you will remain deeply connected to each project through the entire lifecycle in order to ensure conceptual integrity is maintained from design to final implementation.</p>\n <p>This is a remote position but is only open to candidates living in the US or Canada. We’re flexible about location and hours. We’re a really great match for candidate who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p>\n <p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>\n <p>“Must have” requirements:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>5+ years relevant hands-on experience as a full stack Software Engineer, DevOps engineer, or Site Reliability Engineer, ideally within a commercial startup environment.</li>\n  <li>Fluency around current modern best practices around software development and DevOps.</li>\n  <li>Soft skills necessary to navigate and negotiate with multiple teams, both internal and external to Analytics Fire.</li>\n  <li>Ability and willingness to familiarize yourself with our technical stack.</li>\n  <li>Superior organization and detail orientation.</li>\n  <li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</li>\n  <li>Willingness to design, document, and evangelize new engineering processes to meet evolving organizational requirements.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>“Nice to have” requirements:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Hands-on technical experience writing code in&nbsp;Ruby, Python, or JavaScript</li>\n  <li>Previous experience as a technical Program Manager.</li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/206643?reset=False&amp;ra=17iHypx1pUju&amp;oqs=a%3D17iHypx1pUju' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a>\n</div>\n<div> \n</div> \n<h4>About Analytics Fire</h4> \n<div>\n <p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p>\n <p>“We founded Analytics Fire to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. To us that means being able to spend our time working on interesting technical problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Remote</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible Schedule</span> </li> \n</ul>",

You are happy to travel 5-10% per year</li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>We (and our customers) are currently mostly distributed around Europe (around UTC), thus, your main timezone should be somewhere between -2UTC to +2UTC to ensure better communication.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong><strong>Why we think this position is worth applying for (challenge us!)</strong></strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Impact, Impact, Impact!

We encourage you to do your work wherever (some of us travel almost half the year and work from remote islands) and whenever you want (keeping in mind that there are some meetings we would like you to attend). We expect passion and encourage sustainability. If you need rest, take it. If you take up a task, own it. If you see a problem, solve it.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>Teamwork</strong></strong></p>\n <p>We are a growing company with team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible.

If you realise you want to expand your knowledge in a specific area, we support you with conferences, books etc.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>Basics</strong></strong></p>\n <p>We offer fair (transparent and open) salaries with benefits like choosing your own laptop, your choice to work at home or in a coworking space, flexible hours, minimal meetings, transparent communication, etc..
