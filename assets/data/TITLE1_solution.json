Most people have never used a lawyer (other than perhaps for conveyancing) and we want to change that. It is similar to the Babylon health app but for lawyers instead of doctors.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>70This is a fantastic opportunity to make a difference and work with a dynamic and forward thinking startup team. We encourage teamwork and open discussion, especially for problem solving, and we have a real passion for bringing the provision of legal services up to date using tech. In fact, Monaco Solicitors was recently shortlisted in the Law Society Excellence Awards for innovation in technology.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>The product team currently consists of 1 front end dev and 2 designers plus a product owner.

We are a growing team (from 15+ European countries) and every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.</li></ul><ul><li>“It's better to ask forgiveness than permission” (Paolini) - sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things like in the guidebook. Hell, our customers choose us because we are building how the guidebook should look in this day and age. You can try things out.</li></ul><ul><li>We play a key role in our customer's digital transformation. We have partnered up with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to provide our solution on their cloud platforms - more will follow.</li></ul><ul><li>We serve some of Europe's leading organisations and are talking to many more.</li></ul>                </div>                        <h4>About Giant Swarm GmbH</h4>            <div><p><strong><strong>What is it like to work at Giant Swarm?</strong></strong></p><p>We would like to give you a glimpse on how working with <a href='http://giantswarm.io/' rel='nofollow'>Giant Swarm</a> (we are a fully remote team) is like:</p><p><strong><strong>Self-organization</strong></strong></p><p>Creative work needs freedom and openness. We encourage you to do your work wherever (some of us travel almost half the year and work from remote islands) and whenever you want (keeping in mind that there are some meetings we would like you to attend). We expect passion and encourage sustainability. If you need rest, take it. If you take up a task, own it. If you see a problem, solve it.</p><p><strong><strong>Teamwork</strong></strong></p><p>We are a growing company with team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible. Always question the status quo and find new ways of collaboration and team work.</p><p><strong><strong>Learning</strong></strong></p><p>Learning is mandatory and fun at the same time. If you realise you want to expand your knowledge in a specific area, we support you with conferences, books etc.</p><p><strong><strong>Basics</strong></strong></p><p>We offer fair (transparent and open) salaries with benefits like choosing your own laptop, your choice to work at home or in a coworking space, flexible hours, minimal meetings, transparent communication, etc.. And you will participate in our stock options program. Currently our team members have more children than we are employees. So family friendliness is a must.</p><p>We don't hire job descriptions. We hire humans. :)</p><p>We welcome applications from everybody, regardless ethnic or national origin, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or age.</p><p>Interested? Questions?
