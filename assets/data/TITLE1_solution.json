We're looking to add build features, upgrade and maintain our existing systems, as well as plan for a transition where pieces of these systems are either migrated to Drupal 8 or other new solutions over the course of the next couple years. All of this work is intimately connected to the rest of our cloud hosting and devops tooling product -- interest in the &quot;devops&quot; problem space and solving problems for our cloud customers is key. Our team stands at the forefront of user experience, as well as new features being offered to our customers and partners. Being comfortable tackling programming problems from the architecture level all the way down to proper code implementation is a big plus -- the team is small, the to-do list long, and engineers generally have a great deal of autonomy to implement features and drive the product forward. &nbsp;Your contribution matters.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Must Have</strong></p><p>- Senior-level experience with Drupal back-end development (both 7 and 8 ideally) -- custom modules and product/feature builds in Drupal</p><p>- Desire to tackle feature implementation and user experience design challenges from a high-level user story view through final implementation</p><p>- Solid experience with web development patterns and the needs of engineers using a web app development and hosting tool</p><p><strong>Nice to have</strong></p><p>- Familiarity with the other languages in our stack (Javascript, Go, Python)</p><p>- Experience or interest in the &quot;cloud computing&quot; stuff that makes up our back end, anything from distributed computing to networking to devops and the big box that is &quot;make a bunch of Linux containers play nicely together&quot;</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://grnh.se/7ecddeb52' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Platform.sh</h3>            <div><p>Platform.sh is a next-generation hosting and development tool for a wide variety of web applications. Our platform-as-a-service model is designed to take an application from the developer's app codebase to a working set of cloud environments with as few traditional &quot;devops&quot; challenges as possible. This involves a lot of really cool software (mostly written in a mix of Python and Go, and with user-facing tools in PHP and Javascript) that helps us make magical features at all layers of the traditional hosting stack: distributed and redundant storage, automated container orchestration, highly-available applications and services, fast creation and replication of environments, etc.</p><p>The company is entirely distributed with an HQ in Paris that 10-15% of the company works out of. Various team meetups or occasional get togethers both there and around the world are common.</p><p>Travel to various developer-oriented events available to developers who are interested in conferences both, for marketing and educational purposes.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from home, wherever you are</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Safe and friendly working environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options for everyone</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Rest and recovery are essential to health and happiness; we get that</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good.
