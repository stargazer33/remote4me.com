Perhaps being bought out by Autodesk was a smart move, as we are now doubling down on recruiting thanks BigCo cash reserves. I'm not worried at all about the economy affecting Autodesk, and we all just got our raises and bonuses last week. We also have a really good remote culture (~40% remote people) so that's a real plus for this COVID-19 crisis.
