We’re looking for a collaborative but hands-on Solutions Architect to help us scale our execution to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p><p>Analytics Fire is a deeply technical engineering organization. Most of us are software engineers and spend the majority of our time on heads down engineering activities like coding. Our goal in creating this position is to expand our small client-facing team with a unique person that has both the personality and the technical skill set to collaborate directly with clients and senior members of the technical team in order to help steer technical decision making and requirements gathering, especially early in the project lifecycle.</p><p>This position is similar to that of a technical Program Manager, but you will be much more involved in the technical details and hurdles around software architecture than a traditional Project Manager would be. Our ideal candidate is a current or former full stack Software Engineer that is willing to be trained in formal Program Management processes (or has already been trained in formal Program Management processes).</p><p>As a small company, Analytics Fire is able to tailor roles around the strengths of our individual team members. We will tailor this role to your specific technical background. However, it is a hard requirement that you are able to support the following 3 types of responsibilities:</p><ul><li>(a) Represent Analytics Fire software engineering teams in client-facing interactions (and sometimes interactions with potential clients)</li><li>(b) Technical writing responsibilities such as documenting requirements, project plans, system architecture, etc.</li><li>(c) Making meaningful contributions to the execution of complex software projects.</li></ul><p>For reference, here is a list of some technologies we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p><ul><li>JavaScript: React / Angular /&nbsp;Typescript / GraphQL</li><li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node</li><li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li><li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li><li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li><li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li><li>Other technologies we are currently building with: AWS, GCP, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Yocto, Salesforce platform, iOS, ARKit</li></ul><p>Your primary responsibility will be to assist in guiding new projects through sales, planning, development, and deployment. This will be accomplished through a combination of client interactions, technical writing, and participation in formal sales, program management, and engineering related processes. Your contributions will naturally be slightly front-loaded towards the sales and planning phases, however you will remain deeply connected to each project through the entire lifecycle in order to ensure conceptual integrity is maintained from design to final implementation.</p><p>This is a remote position but is only open to candidates living in the US or Canada. We’re flexible about location and hours. We’re a really great match for candidate who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>“Must have” requirements:</p><ul><li>5+ years relevant hands-on experience as a full stack Software Engineer, DevOps engineer, or Site Reliability Engineer, ideally within a commercial startup environment.</li><li>Fluency around current modern best practices around software development and DevOps.</li><li>Soft skills necessary to navigate and negotiate with multiple teams, both internal and external to Analytics Fire.</li><li>Ability and willingness to familiarize yourself with our technical stack.</li><li>Superior organization and detail orientation.</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</li><li>Willingness to design, document, and evangelize new engineering processes to meet evolving organizational requirements.</li></ul><p>“Nice to have” requirements:</p><ul><li>Hands-on technical experience writing code in&nbsp;Ruby, Python, or JavaScript</li><li>Previous experience as a technical Program Manager.</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/206643?reset=False&amp;ra=17iHypx1pUju&amp;oqs=a%3D17iHypx1pUju' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Analytics Fire</h3>            <div><p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p><p>“We founded Analytics Fire to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

You build and maintain helm charts that might start out as a special project for one customer and end up being a managed service run by all our customers.</li></ul><ul><li>You hold trainings and workshops at conferences, for our existing customers, as well as with Giant Swarm’s potential customers. . &nbsp;Do note that the role requires minimum travel as most of our interactions as a fully remote company are via video conferencing.<br><br></li><li>Learn from customer's problems with moving to microservices architectures, get your hands dirty and find out what Cloud Native project's entrails look like. The more successful our customers are with the Cloud Native journey, the more successful we are.</li></ul><ul><li>Ultimately, you are also responsible for documentation, helping the product teams implement fixes, prioritizing features and making sure we only need to answer questions once.<br><br></li><li>First impressions are important!

Your communication skills (especially written form) are excellent. Very good English skills are a must-have. German skills are a bonus.</li></ul><ul><li>You are open to attend conferences with our team and hold talks in front of customers. You are happy to travel 5-10% per year</li></ul><ul><li>We (and our customers) are currently mostly distributed around Europe (around UTC), thus, your main timezone should be somewhere between -2UTC to +2UTC to ensure better communication.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Why we think this position is worth applying for (challenge us!)</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Impact, Impact, Impact! We are a growing team (from 15+ European countries) and every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.</li></ul><ul><li>“It's better to ask forgiveness than permission” (Paolini) - sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things like in the guidebook. Hell, our customers choose us because we are building how the guidebook should look in this day and age. You can try things out.</li></ul><ul><li>We play a key role in our customer's digital transformation. We have partnered up with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to provide our solution on their cloud platforms - more will follow.</li></ul><ul><li>We serve some of Europe's leading organisations and are talking to many more.</li></ul>                </div>                        <h3>About Giant Swarm GmbH</h3>            <div><p><strong><strong>What is it like to work at Giant Swarm?</strong></strong></p><p>We would like to give you a glimpse on how working with <a href='http://giantswarm.io/' rel='nofollow'>Giant Swarm</a> (we are a fully remote team) is like:</p><p><strong><strong>Self-organization</strong></strong></p><p>Creative work needs freedom and openness.

If you see a problem, solve it.</p><p><strong><strong>Teamwork</strong></strong></p><p>We are a growing company with team members distributed all over Europe and plans on expanding to the US. Our ambitious goals are only achievable as a team. Everybody’s input is highly welcome and appreciated. Although sometimes rules and processes are necessary, we try to keep them as lean as possible.

This is a hybrid role between senior sales lead and a solutions architect. In this role at Modern Tribe you will help the company identify leads, develop relationships and close deals in line with our company values.</div><div><br></div><div>The ideal candidate for this role is someone who has been writing proposals, selling large scale projects and maintaining key relationships for a successful digital agency for 3+ years and has been technically involved in online projects for 5+ years.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ve been running projects for years: you’ve done your own sales, have a proven track record writing proposals that close deals, know how to work with WordPress, and understand the nuances of the WordPress business world. You’ve sold projects in the $75 – $250k+ range, and aren’t afraid to go bigger.</div><div><br></div><div>Above all else, your daily attitude + output embody Modern Tribe’s company ethos of “live well and do good work”: you thrive on keeping the team happy and healthy. Matchmaking — not hitting sales numbers — is your jam. You hustle hard, enjoy the game and relish a genuine success. We pride ourselves on solving real problems for people rather than clutter the interwebs with more shit. If you jive with the mission of setting your team up for success, giving them the right flow and the right kind of projects, even if it means rejecting a potentially-lucrative gig…we’d love to hear from you.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Note that this is not an account management role and scoping + strategy experience are a must-have for this role. Modern Tribe is ONLY looking for technical sales candidates at this time.</span><span></span></div><div><h3><span><span><b>Inclusion Statement</b></span></span></h3></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Modern Tribe is committed to a culture that embraces diversity and inclusion.

To put it simply, they are an award-winning organisation, market leaders in their field with an excellent reputation for providing high-quality and scalable solutions for their customers.</p><p>They are well known in numerous technology channels (e.g. Microsoft, Salesforce, Big Data, Cloud, Java) and their goal is to provide a consistently high level of service to a diverse set of customers, working collaboratively at all times to ensure smooth and pain-free transformations. They have offices all over the UK and offer an excellent benefits package, alongside the opportunity to work on cutting-edge projects in both the public and private sectors.</p><p><strong>The journey continues</strong> with the role, part of a huge recruitment drive planned for early 2019 and part of the organisation’s ‘Architectural Strategy’ function. This function focuses on bespoke application development and Cloud transformations, with the main crux of the work being Agile software integrations on an enterprise scale.</p><p>As a Senior Solutions Architect, you will be primarily focused on developing and delivering solutions for both internal and external clients. </p><p>You will combine deep understanding and experience of shaping integration solutions with the personal skills and credibility to lead and guide some of the best technical teams in the business to successful delivery. You will take accountability for ensuring that the end-to-end integration solutions they create for their customers fulfil their expectations of high quality and cost-effectiveness. </p><p>Additionally, you will be able to demonstrate CXO-facing experience in shaping IT integration technology deployment and governance. You will also have a keen understanding of commercial cost models and the business benefit value derived from their customer’s investment in integration technology.</p><p><em>The role will require flexibility around mobility and UK-wide travel, with you essentially working on customer site x3 days per week with x2 day per week home based. They will endeavour to ensure that you are based within the M25 Corridor area 80% of the time, but this cannot always be 100% guaranteed for obvious reasons so this is something you need to be aware of.</em></p><p><strong>The journey draws to a close</strong> with the requirements… which are pretty diverse! So in order to truly get the most out of this role, you’ll bring some of the following skills to the table:</p><p><strong><em>E2E Architecture</em> – </strong>you should have a fundamental understanding of Enterprise Architecture, Solutions Architecture and E2E Solutions Design. You should be able to work across various designs/methods (N-Tier, SOA, Microservices etc.), with any industry certifications (e.g. TOGAF) being a huge bonus.</p><p><em><strong>Integration Experience</strong></em> – you must also have proven experience delivering integration projects, including working with tools such as Mulesoft, Apache, Del Boomi, Tibco etc.</p><p><em><strong>Stakeholder Management</strong></em> – due to the nature of this organisation (e.g. a customer-facing consultancy), you should have a proven track record both managing and influencing c-level stakeholders throughout the delivery lifecycle.</p><p><em><strong>Software Development Background</strong> </em>– it is crucial that you have a background in Software Development and Software Architecture due to the nature of this role, so this wouldn’t suit Infrastructure Architects or Data Architects. You should have an understanding of the full Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), ideally with previous exposure to Microsoft/Open Source development, APIs and Cloud (AWS, Azure) technology.</p><p>Finally, the journey ends with you… i.e. how you decide to proceed.</p><p>If you decide you want to proceed to a chat, then give me a shout. You can call me on either <strong></strong> or <strong></strong>.</p><p>Alternatively, send me an email to <strong></strong> or drop me a LinkedIn message by searching for <strong>‘Liam Haghighat’.</strong></p><p>However, if you feel this role isn’t right for you then I wish you the best of luck with the remainder of your job search!</p><p><em><strong>Anything discussed in relation to this advert will remain confidential and fully compliant with GDPR.</strong></em></p><p></p></div><p></p><strong>Salary :</strong> <p>Minimum:<br>Maximum:<br>Currency: British Pound .

Our goal is to deliver contemporary web applications to an industry mired in late 90’s technology.
