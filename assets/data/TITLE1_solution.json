SDVI Rally provides SaaS-based, dynamic management of a media company’s supply chain infrastructure, including compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as third-party media applications such as transcoding and QC analysis tools and the resources they require. Our solution architects are responsible for working directly with our customers and technical account management team to ensure customers are able to gain maximum benefit from our platform.</p><p>As part of an internationally distributed team, headquartered in Sunnyvale but working from home and in the field, you are assertive, energetic, an excellent communicator and a highly effective collaborator.

As a solutions architect, your focus is supporting the technical account management (TAM) team during the process of initial customer engagements, via POC design and implementation, as well as the ongoing expansion of existing deployments. Additionally, some aspects of technical support and training are required, ensuring the success of our customers as they become self-sufficient in the use of the SDVI Rally platform.</p><p>Your technical capabilities will allow you to quickly learn the Rally platform inside and out.

A great sense of humor is highly valued around here - that’s what keeps our energy up and makes us look forward to working together each day.</p><p>And we do work closely together every day, even though we don’t share an office. As a completely distributed company, we each work in the place that makes the most sense for us, whether at home, on the road, in a shared business workspace… the possibilities are really up to you.
