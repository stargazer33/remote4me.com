Examples of projects you might work on include: researching how browser fingerprinting is happening in the wild and developing solutions to protect our users against it, running experiments to measure and improve the usability of privacy features across our products, and taking ownership of the technology that powers our privacy solutions (e.g. a crawler that identifies trackers on the web or the cross-platform implementation of tracker blocking in our apps and extensions).&nbsp;</p><p>We are a remote company, we empower our team to work wherever they want around the world. That means you have to be self-directed and self-motivated to succeed. If that seems awesome and you like the idea of our core values -- Build trust, Question assumptions, and Validate direction -- you'll fit right in.</p><strong>What you will do:</strong><ul><li>Lead projects from proposal through postmortem, assessing vague problems, proposing high impact solutions, and executing them against a set of success criteria.</li><li>Contribute to and demonstrate ownership over major components of our privacy technology, taking responsibility for their maintenance and improvement over time.</li><li>Represent DuckDuckGo externally as part of industry privacy working groups, conferences or standards body discussions.</li><li>Step up to resolve product issues that impact our users – large and small.</li><li>Play a key role in improving our software architecture (in both our user-facing products, and internal processes) with the goal of increasing quality and throughput.</li><li>Mentor peers through remote collaboration opportunities, including: product brainstorms, technical design discussions, pair programming sessions and code reviews.</li><li>Write pragmatic, testable code that works consistently across devices.</li></ul><strong>What we are looking for:</strong><ul><li>Experience working on privacy solutions in an engineering capacity (e.g. tracker blocker, password manager, or similar technology).</li><li>Deep understanding of web technologies, how they can be exploited and how they can be used to prevent against exploits.</li><li>Deep technical understanding of online privacy threats and the existing solution space to protect against them.</li><li>Proficiency in JavaScript.</li><li>Effective project management skills.</li><li>Creative problem solvers and risk takers. You like to take initiative to push projects forward but know when to involve others.</li><li>Excellent communication skills. You can validate your decisions and communicate them clearly.</li></ul><strong>Other things to know:</strong><ul><li>While we leverage specific job titles for hiring purposes, we do not use them internally. Instead, we follow our own professional levels, with expectations for each level clearly defined across several dimensions.</li><li>We are a small, remote team distributed across time zones, and we rely on a variety of communication tools throughout the day</li><li>Sometimes we meet up! Expect to travel at least two times a year: once for our all-hands meetup and again for a team retreat (each ~4-5 days).</li><li>We believe in a focused approach to collaboration, where individual team members work on a single top priority at a time, each supporting larger, company-wide objectives. This philosophy serves to impact our vision to raise the standard of trust online.</li><li>Our work philosophy centers on empowered project management. All team members have opportunities to run projects.</li><li>Transparency supports individual and team success at DuckDuckGo.

Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast&nbsp;software and are the basis for&nbsp;our company culture.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3. Together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone. These principles govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. We strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><ol><li>Quality: Strive to deliver software that is reliable, stable, and free of defects.</li><li>Positivity: Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</li><li>Scalable Thinking: Make things work well as they scale up or down.</li><li>Bias Towards Simplicity: Try to make things as simple as possible.</li><li>Humility: Assume others are smart. Give credit to others for their&nbsp;ideas and work.</li><li>Honesty: Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</li><li>Ownership: Own your projects. Deliver on time. Coordinate with others. Escalate when stuck.</li><li>Community Focus: Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers,&nbsp;and users.</li><li>Commitment: Participate in the decision process. Once a decision is made, work to make it a success, even if you disagreed.</li></ol><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;feels good to team members, customers, partners, investors, and open source users of Hazelcast. If we find that it does not feel good, we need to improve our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
