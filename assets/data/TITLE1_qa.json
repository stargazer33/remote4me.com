You will assess risk and help define the required process to build quality in for everything that we ship.</span></p>\n <p><span>We strongly believe that the path to high-quality software is through an engineering-focused process that is supported by test engineering and quality assurance. As a team we have worked hard not to cultivate a &quot;toss it over the wall&quot; mentality of sharing work between engineering and test. Instead, we believe in a collaborative approach to defining the necessary steps to build quality into the engineering and release process.</span></p>\n <p><span>Our application will be developed using Scala, Spark, Hadoop, and SQL.

    "content": "<div>\n In-Home Usage Tester (Product Tester from home) Part-time\n <br>\n <br>Presently we're recruiting Product Testers (from home) in several US cities to expand our private network of In-Home Usage Testers (IHUT) to fulfill upcoming contracts with national and international companies. We guarantee 15-20 hours per week with an hourly pay of between $25/hr. and $45/hr., depending on the In-Home Usage Test project. No experience required. \n <br>American Consumer Panels is a consulting firm that specializes in product testing and product development work. We design and conduct In-Home Usage Testing (IHUT) locally and nationally to provide actual user feedback to companies and market research firms to evaluate products, packaging, related product instructions and more. \n <br>We leverage our network of private panels (In-Home Usage Testers) to provide product testers to companies for evaluating the in-home experience with a wide variety of products to ensure proper product certification and greater market access. \n <br>Please note that although this job can be done from home 95% of the time, very occasionally In-Home Product Testers may be asked to visit the client's office, laboratory, store, warehouse or factory for training or meetings (visits are local and scheduled at no more than 20 minutes drive from the In-Home Usage Tester address). These optional visits are also paid by the hour. \n <br>During your application process, we will determine your consumer profile and establish what products would be suitable for you to test according to your demographics, lifestyle, consumer behavior, skills, hobbies and ability. Research questionnaires are used to identify and target certain types of consumers, to ensure the right participants are engaged and to achieve the representative sample needed. Job candidates for In-Home Usage Testing are also screened to meet the client s needs for the project to ensure that the product is one that they qualify to test and that they have a balance of demographics and attitudes. \n <br>Participation in these product testing and consumer panels is always free, secure and private. In-Home Usage Testing is a quick, easy and fun way to make extra cash by telling big brands what you think about their upcoming products and services in the American market.\n <br>\n <br>Main duties: \n <br>Sign and return non-disclosure agreements before the product to be tested is shipped. Individuals who complete the required documents will have the products sent to their homes.\n <br>Once the product is received for In-Home Usage Test (IHUT), the Product Tester must take care of the product being tested and use it responsibly.\n <br>Read and strictly follow the In-Home Usage Test Daily Schedule provided with each product testing project. In-Home Usage Test Daily Schedules may include tasks to do such as: unpacking, reading instructions, journal entries, online or mobile feedback, usage of product for certain amount of time, writing reviews, taking pictures, etc.\n <br>Properly document In-Home Usage Test as instructed in the In-Home Usage Test Daily Schedule. Types of documentation commonly used for In-Home Usage Tests are snapshots, audio recordings, videos and Product Journals. \n <br>Attend Skype meetings or conference call meetings with Account Managers, Brand Managers, Research Managers, Product Managers or small business owners to offer ongoing product usage feedback. These short virtual meetings may take place 2-3 times per week and are paid by the hour also.\n <br>Some In-Home Usage Tests projects may require participants to use MFour s Mobile In-Home Use Test Technology (cutting edge smartphone technology to capture Point-of-Emotion insights to gain unparalleled depth of responses).\n <br>Paid Product Testing is done from home 95% of the time, but very occasionally paid Product Testers may be asked to visit the client's office, laboratory, store, warehouse or factory for training or meetings. These visits are paid by the hour also.\n <br>There are times when the product testing may be discussed in a private chat room that is opened by the market research group.\n <br>Write reviews as requested in the In-Home Usage Test Daily Schedule for each project. \n <br>Review requirements can vary, however, the standard requirement is a written review, photos of the reviewer with the product and a video review. \n <br>\n <br>Requirements:\n <br>Great ability to follow precise instructions\n <br>Be open to write short reviews, record audio or short video (doesn't have to be perfect), no experience needed\n <br>Great attention to detail and curious spirit\n <br>Be able to work 15-20 hours per week and commit to a certain routine\n <br>Have access to a computer and a reliable internet connection\n <br>Have access to a digital camera or cellphone that takes pictures\n <br>Be honest and reliable\n <br>Good communication skills is an asset\n <br>No experience required\n <br>High School Diploma\n <br>18 years or older\n <br>\n <br>A paid Product Tester position is perfect for those looking for an entry level opportunity or for seasonal work, temporary work or part-time work.

We’re passionate about helping companies transform their static digital content into engaging experiences. From custom interactive microcontent, to immersive event microsites, you can build it with Ceros. Publish and update live content instantly, and embed it into your site instantly. Join us in ending the endless creation of static content and be part of the movement towards meaningful content experiences.</p>\n <p>We are well-funded and venture-backed by prominent investors including Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Team</strong></p>\n <p>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not easy. We require the best-of-the-best developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop design software to the web, often pushing browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</p>\n <p>As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working in a small, cross-functional group with the most talented people you’ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute. Every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.</p>\n <p>We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it’s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO’s atrocious spelling.</p>\n <p>This position is 100% remote, but we are primarily in US Eastern time zone and prefer candidates who can have an overlapping work schedule with the rest of the team.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Job</strong></p>\n <p>Affectionately referred to internally as “The Day-Ruiners”, our QA specialists work side by side with developers and designers to ensure product excellence.&nbsp;We’re looking for a QE Lead to drive the definition and evolution of QE processes, as well as automation, to optimize efficiency and quality while meeting the demands of rapid growth. The perfect candidate should have strong, quality engineering experience in agile environments, and team leadership skills.</p>\n <p>Day to day responsibilities include ensuring that our QA team runs as efficient as possible, testing new features, writing and maintaining automated tests, working with our support team to triage and document defects found in production, and assisting with releases. You should have previous experience testing web applications and know where things can break down. Proficiency using browser developer tools and being comfortable with the command line is also a must.

Its complicated administrative processes contribute largely to its struggle to keep up with rapidly advancing technology, resulting in bad experiences for both patients and healthcare professionals alike.</p> \n <p>As the first digital hospital, we are rebuilding the healthcare experience from scratch. This is what allows us to provide patients with an outstanding level of care that we would love to experience ourselves.</p> \n <p>Backed by renowned international investors, we are helping an ever-growing number of patients receive the highest quality of medical procedures the UK has to offer. To help us maintain this level of care, we need to expand our XXX team with highly motivated and passionate people who thrive in a fast-paced and dynamic work environment.</p> \n <p>—-</p> \n <p><strong>What you will do:</strong></p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Production and management of medical content for both patients and our team</li> \n  <li>Researching and developing a strong understanding of a variety of different medical and surgical procedures across a range of specialties</li> \n  <li>Training new and existing staff on those procedures</li> \n  <li>Management and upkeep of the company knowledge database</li> \n  <li>Organisation and management of patient care packages</li> \n  <li>Communication and troubleshooting across a number of different departments</li> \n  <li>Communication with and management of the remote medical team.</li> \n </ul> \n <p><strong>What you bring to the table:</strong></p> \n <ul> \n  <li>Are fluent in both written and spoken English (no German skills required)</li> \n  <li>Have completed a degree (preferably in the field of healthcare)</li> \n  <li>Have previous experience with teaching small groups</li> \n  <li>Have previous experience with researching and writing medical content</li> \n  <li>Have outstanding organisational skills and can juggle a lot of projects at the same time</li> \n  <li>Are a fast learner, want to quickly assume responsibility and gain ownership of your own projects</li> \n  <li>Enjoy continually working with a number of people from different departments within the company including Patient Care, Marketing and Product and a remote team.</li> \n  <li>Work experience in the startup environment is a plus</li> \n </ul> \n <p>—-</p> \n <p><strong>What the crew is like and why I love working here:</strong></p> \n <p>Our Medbelle family is a small and truly international team (75%+ internationals). We pride ourselves on our company culture that’s focused on building a great service with a professional emphasis on numbers and growth.</p> \n <p>As a typical Berlin startup, we, of course, have the usual fun stuff: free coffee &amp; British tea, fruits, pancake Tuesdays, an amazing Villa in Kreuzberg, Friday memes and team events we probably shouldn’t talk about here. But what I love most about working for Medbelle is the honest desire to help improve the experiences of our patients – that’s what keeps us motivated and driven.</p> \n <p>We move quickly. If you are a great match, we can cover the initial phone interviews, an on-site interview with me and a chat with the founders all within two weeks. I look forward to hearing from you!</p> \n <p>Sarah</p> \n <p>Head of Patient Care</p> \n</div>\n<a href='https://medbelle.breezy.hr/p/09e505d2e40d01-medical-quality-manager' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this position</a>",

Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast&nbsp;software and are the basis for&nbsp;our company culture.</p>\n <p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3. Together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone. These principles govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. We strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p>\n <p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p>\n <ol>\n  <li>Quality: Strive to deliver software that is reliable, stable, and free of defects.</li>\n  <li>Positivity: Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</li>\n  <li>Scalable Thinking: Make things work well as they scale up or down.</li>\n  <li>Bias Towards Simplicity: Try to make things as simple as possible.</li>\n  <li>Humility: Assume others are smart. Give credit to others for their&nbsp;ideas and work.</li>\n  <li>Honesty: Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</li>\n  <li>Ownership: Own your projects. Deliver on time. Coordinate with others. Escalate when stuck.</li>\n  <li>Community Focus: Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers,&nbsp;and users.</li>\n  <li>Commitment: Participate in the decision process. Once a decision is made, work to make it a success, even if you disagreed.</li>\n </ol>\n <p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p>\n <p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;feels good to team members, customers, partners, investors, and open source users of Hazelcast. If we find that it does not feel good, we need to improve our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Commuter Benefits</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span> </li> \n</ul>",

We believe in change through accountability, debate, ambition and respect for the communities and individuals that make up our networked universe(s).&nbsp;</p>\n <p>Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to control a large group of people from the top down, which is why military organizations, industrial corporations and nation-states have relied on it so heavily. But hierarchies carry their own institutional costs, which means that a regulatory bureaucracy can focus only on a few issues at a time – generally those most important to the people at the top or to the dominant groups in the ruling coalition.</p>\n <p>But what if we can organize this company to embody the very structures of those network communication technologies and digital platforms we hope to build? What if this can enable us to take on all those dinosaur hierarchies as equals - and more than equals? What if self-regulation and social cooperation can be amplified and intensified in this way to empower all of us to care for our selves and ourselves without any authority?</p>\n <p>That’s why Mav Farm is&nbsp;stigmergic. Like the products we build, stigmergy is a form of self-organization social network. It's the principle that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergic networks are superior to hierarchies, in that they are not slowed down by bureaucratic permission-seeking, communication asymmetries and problems associated with top-down coordination. Instead stigmergy allows individual contributors or cells to freely work within a shared platform, contributing to a shared goal as they see fit.</p>\n <p>With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project. The innovations of individual contributors can freely travel throughout the chain when others wish to adopt them. Think of stigmergy as a heuristic approach to improving everything, allowing all of us to be agile and flexible.</p>\n <p>This is our shorthand way of saying that we don’t have any management, and nobody “reports to” anybody else. We do have Founders, but even they aren't your manager. This company is yours to steer—toward opportunities and away from risks, toward high performance and quick creative fixes. You have the power to green-light projects. You have the power to ship products.</p>\n <p>In this stigmergic structure every organizational barrier is removed between your work and the customer enjoying that work. Every company will tell you that “the customer is boss,” but here that statement has weight. There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what our customers want, and then giving it to them.</p>\n <p>So far, our team has designed, architected and built things like: motion tracking in video, object recognition in video, machine learning recommender systems, real-time graphics shaders, AR shopping experiences, business intelligence dashboards, marketplace apps, video streaming apps and more. Our sights are set high! Where will you take us?</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Full medical, dental and vision</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Retirement/401K Plan</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Unlimited PTO</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible schedules</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Life &amp; Disability coverage</span> </li> \n</ul>",
