We got there because we have a killer open-source culture. We have over fifty open-source repos, hundreds of downloads a week, and we attend meetups all over the world to help developers.</p><p>We are looking for an experienced coder to curate, innovate, and lead development on our JS/TS, Python, Java, Swift, Go, C++, C# and Rust OS projects. Even more than writing code, the one essential skill set we are looking for is <strong>solid open-source governance skills</strong>. Ideally, you are a maintainer or contributor to several OSS projects (including potentially ones you've created) and you've learned along the way to empathize with developers from all walks of life, especially when the going gets tough.</p><p><strong>We ❤️ Open Source</strong></p><p>Meeshkan started as an open-source project - we were building a giant, distributed Machine Learning compiler. We quickly realized the business case for open-source: by making innovative and useful tools for developers, you gain their trust and win more business.</p><p>This way of thinking led us to unmock.io, the world's first and only Javascript API Fuzz testing library. Unmock is the beating heart of our company: all of our business comes from it, and we have met a passionate and diverse group of engineers along the way, from users to enthusiastic influencers to partnerships with companies like CircleCI to conversations with some of the largest tech companies in the world.</p><p>We are looking for a talented engineer to join our team and help curate and grow our world-class open source projects.</p><p><strong>Your Role in Meeshkan</strong></p><p>At Meeshkan, you would help grow, prune, and channel our open source projects towards the needs of the world's developers. This would mostly be through code contributions, repository design and articles. We are looking for a polyglot that feels comfortable writing idiomatic, beautiful code in many different languages. At our heart, we are a functional-programming company, and we are especially interested in candidates that are passionate about languages like Scala, Haskell, PureScript, OCaml, ReasonML, Coq, Clojure, Scheme, F#, and projects like fp-ts and fp-core.rs.</p><p>Open-source projects only work if they grow out of a collective desire to do something great. Your job starts with having your ear to that need by attending conferences, working with developers from other companies, and working with our other amazing open-source engineers to make a dent in the world. From there, we expect you to have the autonomy and drive to create compelling features, make bold and opinionated stylistic choices, onboard contributors, and defend your ideas and choices in writing. To give you a taste of some of our current activities, check out <a href='https://github.com/unmock/unmock-js/pulls' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/unmock/unmock-js/pulls</a> and <a href='https://gitter.im/unmock/community' rel='nofollow'>https://gitter.im/unmock/community</a>.</p><p>We don't shy away from the business case for open source. We embrace it. This means that, unlike many open source projects, we look for ways to convert the most value-additive aspects of our open source code bases into services that companies pay for on a recurring basis. We expect all employees working with our open source projects to have bold ideas about which elements of our open source projects can be viable services and take risks to build prototypes of these services.</p><p><strong>Your Git Commits</strong></p><p>We are looking for candidates for this position that have a strong track record of git commits to open source projects, reporting issues to open source projects, writing documentation for open source projects and/or code review for open source projects. When you apply, please point to a place we can learn about these things.</p><p><strong>Company Culture</strong></p><p>Your day-to-day work would be fairly independent, but the entire team is always available for collaboration as a sounding board. We are low on formalities and high on substance, and in addition to our operational team, we have a broad network of advisors and investors that are always willing to help out in ideation and introductions. We have a generous office hours and vacation policy, but we are one of the most high-intensity and high-output companies in town due to the fast pace of our industry. Because of this, we are also hyper-sensitive to stress and wellbeing, and offer employees ample opportunities to recharge and feel good.</p><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><p>We are committed to fostering a diverse workplace, and we make it a special point to welcome candidates from underrepresented groups in tech companies. We know that, if you are part of one of these groups, you may have suffered from systemic industry-wide biases that make it more difficult for you to shine than other folks. We don't like that, and we are committed to evaluating every candidate on their own merits given their unique experiences.</p><p><strong>Parting Shot</strong></p><p>We put open source at the heart of everything we do. We have over thirty years of combined experience contributing to and leading open source projects. If you share the same love and appetite for a challenge, come work with us!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/300873?reset=False&amp;ra=1CU0WQtH7WCc&amp;oqs=a%3D1CU0WQtH7WCc%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About Meeshkan</h4>            <div><p>We are Meeshkan, and we build fake stuff for developers.

Even if you're working remotely for Meeshkan, the TCP packets carrying your messages will <strong>love</strong> traveling to and from Helsinki. Additionally, here are some of the things we value.</p><p><strong>Open-source</strong></p><p>We believe that business comes from trust and relationships, not proprietary code. We have open-sourced over 90% of our code base, and most of our projects are open-source from day one. When you work at Meeshkan, most of your work will be spent on code that is or can become open-source. This can either be on the company's GitHub or, if you'd like to be a maintainer, on whatever social code sharing account you fancy, including of course your own GitHub account. Our most ambitious project <a href='https://www.unmock.io' rel='nofollow'>unmock.io</a>, an API-(un)mocking library, has hundreds of downloads a week and an active community of developers hailing from over the world.</p><p><strong>Polyglots</strong></p><p>While all of us have our specialties, we regularly change stuff up and make contributions to projects that are outside our comfort zone. We love working with people that enjoy this type of challenge, and we do lots of peer programming and code review to make sure that <em>everyone</em> feels comfortable doing new things.</p><p><strong>Meetups</strong></p><p>We love offline events, especially meetups. Members of our team organize meetups like <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-JS/' rel='nofollow'>BerlinJS</a>, <a href='https://queerjs.com/' rel='nofollow'>QueerJS</a> and <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Helsinki-Functional-Programming' rel='nofollow'>Helsinki Functional Programming</a>. Employees use company time to attend meetups and prep talks and workshops ranging from <a href='https://pycon.ee' rel='nofollow'>PyCon Estonia</a> to <a href='https://www.reactindia.io' rel='nofollow'>React India</a>.</p><p><strong>Experimentation and learning</strong></p><p>We regularly take time to hone our skills through classes and experiments, from <a href='https://theshortcut.org' rel='nofollow'>Azure Certifications</a> right in our building to authoring <a href='https://wall-lang.netlify.com' rel='nofollow'>new programming languages</a>.</p><p><strong>Your day-to-day at Meeshkan</strong></p><p>Just look at some of our <a href='https://github.com/unmock' rel='nofollow'>Git repos</a> or our <a href='https://gitter.im/unmock/community' rel='nofollow'>Gitter</a> to see! Most of our communication is done openly for the world to audit, comment on, and join if so inclined. We are big on retros, prototyping, and constant collaboration. We have flexible hours, are high on substance, love deleting code, and follow the ancient mirror-making wisdom &quot;it is faster to build a four-inch mirror followed by a six-inch mirror than to build a six-inch mirror.&quot;</p><p><strong>The team</strong></p><p>We're small. The company has four full time employees and, with part-timers, ten depending how you count. We are a lean, well-funded, highly motivated bunch that's build a fake version of the whole darn internet. And we would love for you to join us and build part of our Meeshkan.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Amazing developer experience </span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours </span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock option plan </span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health care </span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote friendly </span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Conferences and education </span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</p><p>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal!</p><p><strong><em>*Our positions are fully remote and to ensure compliance with all applicable labor laws, are open to U.S.-based applicants only. In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, New York, or New Jersey as it is difficult for distributed companies like ours to hire in those locations.*</em></strong></p><p><strong>Our Culture</strong></p><ul><li><strong>We’re a remote company.</strong>&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is partially funded by the company.</li><li><strong>We work hard and move fast.&nbsp;</strong>We’re working on a lot of different websites with varying underlying technologies. You’ll see a lot of pages and forms and there’s not a lot of automation. Maintaining quality while working on so much requires more than just checking boxes, you’ll need to think critically.</li><li><strong>Again, we’re a remote company.</strong>&nbsp;That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “pull tickets and check in code” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li></ul><p><strong>What we’re looking for</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Consistency / Reliability.</strong>&nbsp;T<strong>his is a remote position.&nbsp;</strong>You’ll be responsible for keeping the trains moving.</li><li><strong>Strong Communication.&nbsp;</strong>Written communication must be clear.</li><li><strong>Professionalism.&nbsp;</strong>See This is Professionalism article above.</li><li><strong>Gmail / Spreadsheet Proficiency.</strong></li><li><strong>Nice to haves:</strong>&nbsp;Technical focus in schooling<strong>&nbsp;(e.g., Code School, CS, or MIS Degree).</strong></li></ul><p><strong>About the Position</strong></p><ul><li><strong>No prior QA experience is required.</strong>&nbsp;Our QA is a manual process and does not require an enterprise QA skill set.</li><li><strong>Full-time or contracting positions.</strong>&nbsp;At the outset, your schedule should be flexible as work ebbs and flows.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://crometrics.com/qa-analyst/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast&nbsp;software and are the basis for&nbsp;our company culture.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3. Together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone. These principles govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. We strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><ol><li>Quality: Strive to deliver software that is reliable, stable, and free of defects.</li><li>Positivity: Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</li><li>Scalable Thinking: Make things work well as they scale up or down.</li><li>Bias Towards Simplicity: Try to make things as simple as possible.</li><li>Humility: Assume others are smart. Give credit to others for their&nbsp;ideas and work.</li><li>Honesty: Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</li><li>Ownership: Own your projects. Deliver on time. Coordinate with others. Escalate when stuck.</li><li>Community Focus: Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers,&nbsp;and users.</li><li>Commitment: Participate in the decision process. Once a decision is made, work to make it a success, even if you disagreed.</li></ol><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;feels good to team members, customers, partners, investors, and open source users of Hazelcast. If we find that it does not feel good, we need to improve our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

If you have strong technical skills and a passion for all things compiler, then this role could be the one for you.</p><p>As a compiler engineer you'll work as part of the compiler team to design and implement the new Luna compiler and runtime, work that is at the very core of the next phase of Luna's development. You'll have the opportunity to collaborate with a world-class team of engineers, community managers, and business developers (with experience at Bloomberg, GitHub, and PayPal, to name a few), and make your indelible mark on the future of Luna.</p><p><strong>What You'll Do</strong></p><p>As a senior compiler developer, you'll be working on the design and development of the new Luna compiler and runtime, to help support the Language's evolution. This will involve:</p><ul><li>Working to design and implement the new Luna interpreter, including the typechecker, optimiser, and foreign-language interoperability.</li><li>Theoretical and practical treatments of the theory behind Luna's type-system, and the implementation of the type inference and type checking engines for the same.</li><li>Practical work improving both the performance and capabilities of the new interpreter.</li><li>Practical work implementing front-end optimisations for Luna that improve the code that is executed by the interpreter.</li></ul><p><strong>The Skills We're Looking For</strong></p><p>We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:</p><ul><li>Practical and rich experience writing code in both Scala and Java, including experience with type-level programming techniques in the former (3+ years).</li><li>A deep understanding of the JVM, its execution model, and garbage collection behaviours, born of practical experience.</li><li>Experience using the JVM's profiling and debugging tools to solve problems on large-scale projects.</li><li>Practical experience building large and complex software systems.</li><li>Experience in building compilers and/or the design of type systems.</li></ul><p>It would be a big bonus if you had:</p><ul><li>Experience with GraalVM and the Truffle framework for programming language development.</li><li>Experience with dependent type systems, row types, type-checking algorithms, and type-inference.</li></ul><p><strong>About Luna</strong></p><p>Luna is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities are limitless.</p><p>At Luna, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.</p><p>We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see Luna succeed.</p><p><strong>Who You'll Work With</strong></p><p>You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and communication, and input is always welcomed.</p><p>We firmly believe that only by working <em>together</em>, rather than putting our team members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Luna that can be.</p><p><strong>The Details</strong></p><p>As part of the Luna team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules, or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like. We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility of equity as time goes on.</p><p><strong>How To Apply?</strong></p><p>Send us an email at <code><a href='mailto:jobs@luna-lang.org' rel='nofollow'>jobs@luna-lang.org</a></code>, and tell us a little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role! You can also tell us about:</p><ul><li>Some of your past work or projects.</li><li>Why you'd like to work on Luna, and where you imagine Luna being in 5 years.</li><li>The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.</li><li>Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently with your team.</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/289017?reset=False&amp;ra=1yVuGCjMifOo&amp;oqs=a%3D1yVuGCjMifOo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team built around the Humility, Respect, and Trust ideology.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours, possible part / full time remote work.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work in a small team of world-class engineers and make impact on Luna.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive compensation + possibility of equity as time goes on.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equality, diversity &amp; inclusion.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We've got standing desks in our office (no one uses them though :P).</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Currently, our testing group is expanding. So we’re looking for someone who loves playing with (and breaking!) software, and who also enjoys computers and technology.

We’re looking for someone to work part-time (around 20 hours/week), during weekdays and daytime hours. There is the possibility of increasing hours as needs increase in the future.

If you’re the kind of person who re-reads sent emails looking for typos, discovers continuity errors in movies and has no qualms about repeatedly experimenting with a 50-ingredient chili recipe, this job may be for you.</p><p>This role will report directly to the Manager of Quality Assurance.</p><p><strong>About us</strong></p><p>TeamSnap is an award-winning communication and management service for recreational and competitive sports teams, tournaments and organizations. With over 20 million enthusiastic customers in 195 countries, TeamSnap is indispensable for teams, clubs and leagues worldwide.</p><p>We value trust, communication and fun more than big company policies and rules, and we thrive on empowering our people instead of controlling them. TeamSnap has been named to Outside Magazine’s list of Best Places to Work three consecutive years.</p><p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></p><p>As a QA Tester you will work closely with our product teams throughout the feature development cycle. Using your critical thinking skills and clear communication, your ultimate goal will be to prevent bugs and usability issues from being introduced early, enabling faster and easier testing and development later, as well as documenting concerns and inconsistencies as they arise. You must have painstaking attention to detail, patience for repetitive work and a sleuth-like capacity for uncovering non-obvious problems.</p><p>You will create test coverage outlines, bug reports and additional supporting documentation. Often you will be in uncharted waters and it will be up to you to find the rocky shoals that lie just beneath the surface. We play fast and loose with metaphors around here and we expect you to do the same.</p><p>You are not expected to have software development skills or experience with automated test tooling but would be a bonus.</p><p><strong>Some things that are important:</strong></p><ul><li>3-4 years of relevant QA experience as the primary QA tester on a project or team</li><li>Strong knowledge of the principles, practices and procedures of quality assurance testing and the ability to apply this knowledge and skills.</li><li>Possess a solid understanding of process flow and development; strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.</li><li>Strong decision-making skills, with the ability to prioritize and know where to focus.</li><li>Ability to think from a user’s perspective.</li><li>Excellent communication.</li><li>Ability to write clearly and concisely.</li><li>Attention to detail.</li><li>Keen organizational skills.</li><li>A relentless desire to investigate and explore all the nooks and crannies</li><li>A nice demeanor, but not a pushover. Sometimes you have to give developers bad news that their software broke, but in a friendly way.</li><li>Basic interest and knowledge about team sports.</li><li>A no-compromises attitude towards quality.</li><li>Ability to work as part of a geographically-distributed development team</li><li>Flexibility, teamwork, sense of humor and the willingness to do what’s necessary to help a relatively small company grow quickly</li></ul><p><strong>Other things that would be nice to have:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with Jira or similar.</li><li>Experience with Ghost Inspector or similar.</li><li>Experience in both Windows/Mac and Android/iOS.</li><li>Ability to read through all of the bullet points.</li><li>Tons of old iPhone and Android phones just lying around your house.</li><li>Be a parent, coach or participant in a recreational sport</li><li>Be a TeamSnap user (sign up for a free trial to see what we’re about)</li><li>Ability to talk to animals, Doctor Doolittle-style</li></ul><p><strong>Loctaion</strong></p><p><strong>We are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, but this job is remote (unless you happen to live near Boulder, in which case you’re welcome to come to the office). </strong>TeamSnap is a mostly-distributed company, so you must be very comfortable working with people who aren’t in the same physical location as you or each other. While we love all parts of the world, we can only hire US-based citizens at this time.</p><p><strong>Why TeamSnap?</strong></p><ul><li>Work on a product that people use and love</li><li>While we’re still relatively small, we’re not a fly-by-night startup; we’re the leader in a massive market</li><li>We have a proven revenue model, an experienced executive team, solid funding, and a strong strategic plan</li><li>We have fantastic benefits, and you’ll have a stake in the company</li></ul><p>If you’re looking for an opportunity to show off the very best of your skills, in an environment of trust, respect and flexibility, this might very well be the best job you’ll ever have. We’re passionate about helping our customers spend less time organizing and more time playing.</p><p><strong>Benefits and Perks</strong></p><p>We offer competitive salary and benefits, lots of opportunity to develop professionally, and the ability to demonstrate what you can achieve. TeamSnap is still small enough that your actions will help drive our success. Benefits include:</p><ul><li>Competitive salary</li><li>Medical/dental/vision for you and your family</li><li>Education reimbursement up to $1,500/yr</li><li>Wellness stipend of $50/mo</li><li>401K</li><li>Free TeamSnap service for your family and friends</li><li>Free TeamSnap swag.</li><li>Flexible PTO and vacation policy</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://teamsnap.applytojob.com/apply/NjV794YcVL/Quality-Assurance-Tester' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
