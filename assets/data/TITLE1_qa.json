We guarantee 15-20 hours per week with an hourly pay of between $25/hr. and $45/hr., depending on the In-Home Usage Test project. No experience required. <br><br>American Consumer Panels is a consulting firm that specializes in product testing and product development work. We design and conduct In-Home Usage Testing (IHUT) locally and nationally to provide actual user feedback to companies and market research firms to evaluate products, packaging, related product instructions and more. <br><br>We leverage our network of private panels (In-Home Usage Testers) to provide product testers to companies for evaluating the in-home experience with a wide variety of products to ensure proper product certification and greater market access. <br><br>Please note that although this job can be done from home 95% of the time, very occasionally In-Home Product Testers may be asked to visit the client's office, laboratory, store, warehouse or factory for training or meetings (visits are local and scheduled at no more than 20 minutes drive from the In-Home Usage Tester address). These optional visits are also paid by the hour. <br><br>During your application process, we will determine your consumer profile and establish what products would be suitable for you to test according to your demographics, lifestyle, consumer behavior, skills, hobbies and ability.

Detailed, specialized work is the major focus.</p><p>The position will provide security in a stable work environment, allowing you to plan for, focus on and complete tasks on hand. When changes in the nature of the work occur, you will receive direction, training and support.

We’re a 17 person team growing quickly. We’re at the precipice of the classic SaaS hockey stick growth chart and are now starting to scale, so those who produce will be able to define their own path.

Over time, you’ll work on our other apps. Start with one, become an expert, swap to another! You’ll work with everyone on the team in solutioning new features, testing with our success team, and will occasionally join customer calls for trickier testing and feature delivery.</p><p><strong>What the job will bring you</strong></p><p>We always try to use the latest features that Salesforce deploys (i.e. the metadata API, Lightning Flow components, etc.), write APIs to compound more advanced features, optimize how our processes operate across multiple packaged namespaces, and the opportunity to work with peers who each have massive Salesforce experience. This will give you the chance to continuously learn, be challenged, and deliver functionality to customers who crave it. Generally speaking, we deliver what’s most popularly requested to fill needs not filled by other apps in the marketplace, in a way that we think will provide the best UX.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Unambiguous work direction</li><li>Complete tasks from start to finish</li><li>Look to management for direction in areas outside of expertise</li><li>Strong follow-through on delegated tasks and assignments</li><li>Following established policies and procedures and expects other to do the same Leads by example: is the technical expert in the area and does work required of subordinates</li><li>Review and analyze requirements, UX, specifications, and technical design documents, providing timely feedback</li><li>Play the role of test engineer: Design, develop, and execute automated tests</li><li>Identify and report issues found, then verify fixes and perform regression tests</li><li>Create detailed, comprehensive and well-structured test plans and test cases</li><li>Estimate, prioritize, plan and coordinate testing activities</li><li>Liaise with internal teams to identify system requirements</li><li>Investigate the causes of non-conforming software and train users to implement solutions</li><li>Track quality assurance metrics, like defect densities and open defect counts</li></ul><p><strong>Core Skills</strong></p><ul><li>3+ years in a QA role</li><li>Proven work experience in software development and quality assurance</li><li>Strong knowledge of software QA methodologies, tools and processes</li><li>Experience in writing clear, concise and comprehensive test plans and test cases</li><li>Experience working in an Agile/Scrum development process</li><li>Experience with performance and/or security testing is a plus</li></ul><p><strong>Personal Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Keen eye for detail and a commitment to excellence</li><li>Be willing to help your teammates, share your knowledge with them, and learn from them</li><li>Be open to receiving constructive feedback and turning it into process improvements</li><li>Excellent English written and oral communication</li><li>Detailed and organized</li><li><strong>Happy working from home</strong></li><li>Self-learner</li><li>Happy in a fast-paced environment</li><li>Concern for getting work done on time and correctly</li><li>Extremely task-oriented.

We got there because we have a killer open-source culture. We have over fifty open-source repos, hundreds of downloads a week, and we attend meetups all over the world to help developers.</p><p>We are looking for an experienced coder to curate, innovate, and lead development on our JS/TS, Python, Java, Swift, Go, C++, C# and Rust OS projects. Even more than writing code, the one essential skill set we are looking for is <strong>solid open-source governance skills</strong>. Ideally, you are a maintainer or contributor to several OSS projects (including potentially ones you've created) and you've learned along the way to empathize with developers from all walks of life, especially when the going gets tough.</p><p><strong>We ❤️ Open Source</strong></p><p>Meeshkan started as an open-source project - we were building a giant, distributed Machine Learning compiler. We quickly realized the business case for open-source: by making innovative and useful tools for developers, you gain their trust and win more business.</p><p>This way of thinking led us to unmock.io, the world's first and only Javascript API Fuzz testing library. Unmock is the beating heart of our company: all of our business comes from it, and we have met a passionate and diverse group of engineers along the way, from users to enthusiastic influencers to partnerships with companies like CircleCI to conversations with some of the largest tech companies in the world.</p><p>We are looking for a talented engineer to join our team and help curate and grow our world-class open source projects.</p><p><strong>Your Role in Meeshkan</strong></p><p>At Meeshkan, you would help grow, prune, and channel our open source projects towards the needs of the world's developers. This would mostly be through code contributions, repository design and articles. We are looking for a polyglot that feels comfortable writing idiomatic, beautiful code in many different languages. At our heart, we are a functional-programming company, and we are especially interested in candidates that are passionate about languages like Scala, Haskell, PureScript, OCaml, ReasonML, Coq, Clojure, Scheme, F#, and projects like fp-ts and fp-core.rs.</p><p>Open-source projects only work if they grow out of a collective desire to do something great. Your job starts with having your ear to that need by attending conferences, working with developers from other companies, and working with our other amazing open-source engineers to make a dent in the world. From there, we expect you to have the autonomy and drive to create compelling features, make bold and opinionated stylistic choices, onboard contributors, and defend your ideas and choices in writing. To give you a taste of some of our current activities, check out <a href='https://github.com/unmock/unmock-js/pulls' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/unmock/unmock-js/pulls</a> and <a href='https://gitter.im/unmock/community' rel='nofollow'>https://gitter.im/unmock/community</a>.</p><p>We don't shy away from the business case for open source. We embrace it. This means that, unlike many open source projects, we look for ways to convert the most value-additive aspects of our open source code bases into services that companies pay for on a recurring basis. We expect all employees working with our open source projects to have bold ideas about which elements of our open source projects can be viable services and take risks to build prototypes of these services.</p><p><strong>Your Git Commits</strong></p><p>We are looking for candidates for this position that have a strong track record of git commits to open source projects, reporting issues to open source projects, writing documentation for open source projects and/or code review for open source projects. When you apply, please point to a place we can learn about these things.</p><p><strong>Company Culture</strong></p><p>Your day-to-day work would be fairly independent, but the entire team is always available for collaboration as a sounding board. We are low on formalities and high on substance, and in addition to our operational team, we have a broad network of advisors and investors that are always willing to help out in ideation and introductions. We have a generous office hours and vacation policy, but we are one of the most high-intensity and high-output companies in town due to the fast pace of our industry. Because of this, we are also hyper-sensitive to stress and wellbeing, and offer employees ample opportunities to recharge and feel good.</p><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><p>We are committed to fostering a diverse workplace, and we make it a special point to welcome candidates from underrepresented groups in tech companies. We know that, if you are part of one of these groups, you may have suffered from systemic industry-wide biases that make it more difficult for you to shine than other folks. We don't like that, and we are committed to evaluating every candidate on their own merits given their unique experiences.</p><p><strong>Parting Shot</strong></p><p>We put open source at the heart of everything we do. We have over thirty years of combined experience contributing to and leading open source projects. If you share the same love and appetite for a challenge, come work with us!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/300873?reset=False&amp;ra=1CU0WQtH7WCc&amp;oqs=a%3D1CU0WQtH7WCc%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About Meeshkan</h4>            <div><p>We are Meeshkan, and we build fake stuff for developers. Fake APIs, fake databases, fake streams - if they can make it, we can fake it. We do not make fake money (yet), fake Louis Vuitton bags, or <a title=&quot;Fake Books&quot; href='https://archive.org/details/fakebooks' rel='nofollow'>Fake Books</a>, but we'll fake basically anything else that needs faking.</p><p>So who needs fake stuff, you ask?</p><ul><li><strong>Banks</strong> use our mock APIs to create uncannily realistic developer sandboxes.</li><li><strong>Retail stores</strong> ship daily builds of mobile APIs to agencies working on their apps, speeding up development.</li><li><strong>Microservice-oriented companies</strong> use our mocking technology in their CI pipelines, eliminating the need for staging environments and speeding up integration testing.</li><li><strong>IoT</strong> providers ship a virtual twin of their devices to would-be integrators using our patent-pending technologies.</li></ul><p>Chosen by Wired as one of <a href='https://www.wired.co.uk/article/best-startups-in-helsinki-2019#meeshkan' rel='nofollow'>Helsinki's hottest startups of 2019</a> and winners of the <a title=&quot;Slush 100&quot; href='https://news.slush.org/news/the-winner-of-slush-100-is-meeshkan/' rel='nofollow'>Slush 100</a> competition, we've worked with the likes of Netflix, Slack, Twilio, and PayPal on designing world-class fake versions of their world-class services.</p><p><strong>Working at Meeshkan</strong></p><p>People love to work at Meeshkan most because of its great company culture, not to mention the fantastic city of Helsinki in which we're based. Even if you're working remotely for Meeshkan, the TCP packets carrying your messages will <strong>love</strong> traveling to and from Helsinki. Additionally, here are some of the things we value.</p><p><strong>Open-source</strong></p><p>We believe that business comes from trust and relationships, not proprietary code. We have open-sourced over 90% of our code base, and most of our projects are open-source from day one. When you work at Meeshkan, most of your work will be spent on code that is or can become open-source. This can either be on the company's GitHub or, if you'd like to be a maintainer, on whatever social code sharing account you fancy, including of course your own GitHub account. Our most ambitious project <a href='https://www.unmock.io' rel='nofollow'>unmock.io</a>, an API-(un)mocking library, has hundreds of downloads a week and an active community of developers hailing from over the world.</p><p><strong>Polyglots</strong></p><p>While all of us have our specialties, we regularly change stuff up and make contributions to projects that are outside our comfort zone. We love working with people that enjoy this type of challenge, and we do lots of peer programming and code review to make sure that <em>everyone</em> feels comfortable doing new things.</p><p><strong>Meetups</strong></p><p>We love offline events, especially meetups. Members of our team organize meetups like <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-JS/' rel='nofollow'>BerlinJS</a>, <a href='https://queerjs.com/' rel='nofollow'>QueerJS</a> and <a href='https://www.meetup.com/Helsinki-Functional-Programming' rel='nofollow'>Helsinki Functional Programming</a>. Employees use company time to attend meetups and prep talks and workshops ranging from <a href='https://pycon.ee' rel='nofollow'>PyCon Estonia</a> to <a href='https://www.reactindia.io' rel='nofollow'>React India</a>.</p><p><strong>Experimentation and learning</strong></p><p>We regularly take time to hone our skills through classes and experiments, from <a href='https://theshortcut.org' rel='nofollow'>Azure Certifications</a> right in our building to authoring <a href='https://wall-lang.netlify.com' rel='nofollow'>new programming languages</a>.</p><p><strong>Your day-to-day at Meeshkan</strong></p><p>Just look at some of our <a href='https://github.com/unmock' rel='nofollow'>Git repos</a> or our <a href='https://gitter.im/unmock/community' rel='nofollow'>Gitter</a> to see! Most of our communication is done openly for the world to audit, comment on, and join if so inclined. We are big on retros, prototyping, and constant collaboration.

We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</p><p>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal!</p><p><strong><em>*Our positions are fully remote and to ensure compliance with all applicable labor laws, are open to U.S.-based applicants only. In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, New York, or New Jersey as it is difficult for distributed companies like ours to hire in those locations.*</em></strong></p><p><strong>Our Culture</strong></p><ul><li><strong>We’re a remote company.</strong>&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is partially funded by the company.</li><li><strong>We work hard and move fast.&nbsp;</strong>We’re working on a lot of different websites with varying underlying technologies. You’ll see a lot of pages and forms and there’s not a lot of automation. Maintaining quality while working on so much requires more than just checking boxes, you’ll need to think critically.</li><li><strong>Again, we’re a remote company.</strong>&nbsp;That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “pull tickets and check in code” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li></ul><p><strong>What we’re looking for</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Consistency / Reliability.</strong>&nbsp;T<strong>his is a remote position.&nbsp;</strong>You’ll be responsible for keeping the trains moving.</li><li><strong>Strong Communication.&nbsp;</strong>Written communication must be clear.</li><li><strong>Professionalism.&nbsp;</strong>See This is Professionalism article above.</li><li><strong>Gmail / Spreadsheet Proficiency.</strong></li><li><strong>Nice to haves:</strong>&nbsp;Technical focus in schooling<strong>&nbsp;(e.g., Code School, CS, or MIS Degree).</strong></li></ul><p><strong>About the Position</strong></p><ul><li><strong>No prior QA experience is required.</strong>&nbsp;Our QA is a manual process and does not require an enterprise QA skill set.</li><li><strong>Full-time or contracting positions.</strong>&nbsp;At the outset, your schedule should be flexible as work ebbs and flows.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://crometrics.com/qa-analyst/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast&nbsp;software and are the basis for&nbsp;our company culture.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3. Together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone. These principles govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. We strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><ol><li>Quality: Strive to deliver software that is reliable, stable, and free of defects.</li><li>Positivity: Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</li><li>Scalable Thinking: Make things work well as they scale up or down.</li><li>Bias Towards Simplicity: Try to make things as simple as possible.</li><li>Humility: Assume others are smart. Give credit to others for their&nbsp;ideas and work.</li><li>Honesty: Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</li><li>Ownership: Own your projects. Deliver on time. Coordinate with others. Escalate when stuck.</li><li>Community Focus: Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers,&nbsp;and users.</li><li>Commitment: Participate in the decision process. Once a decision is made, work to make it a success, even if you disagreed.</li></ol><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;feels good to team members, customers, partners, investors, and open source users of Hazelcast. If we find that it does not feel good, we need to improve our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
