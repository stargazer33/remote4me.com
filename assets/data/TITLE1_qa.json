Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast&nbsp;software and are the basis for&nbsp;our company culture.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3. Together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone. These principles govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. We strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><ol><li>Quality: Strive to deliver software that is reliable, stable, and free of defects.</li><li>Positivity: Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</li><li>Scalable Thinking: Make things work well as they scale up or down.</li><li>Bias Towards Simplicity: Try to make things as simple as possible.</li><li>Humility: Assume others are smart. Give credit to others for their&nbsp;ideas and work.</li><li>Honesty: Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</li><li>Ownership: Own your projects. Deliver on time. Coordinate with others. Escalate when stuck.</li><li>Community Focus: Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers,&nbsp;and users.</li><li>Commitment: Participate in the decision process. Once a decision is made, work to make it a success, even if you disagreed.</li></ol><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;feels good to team members, customers, partners, investors, and open source users of Hazelcast. If we find that it does not feel good, we need to improve our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

These optional visits are also paid by the hour.&nbsp;</p><p>During your application process, we will determine your consumer profile and establish what products would be suitable for you to test according to your demographics, lifestyle, consumer behavior, skills, hobbies and ability. Research questionnaires are used to identify and target certain types of consumers, to ensure the right participants are engaged and to achieve the representative sample needed. Job candidates for In-Home Usage Testing are also screened to meet the client’s needs for the project to ensure that the product is one that they qualify to test and that they have a balance of demographics and attitudes.&nbsp;</p><p>Participation in these product testing and consumer panels is always free, secure and private.

You might just be the perfect fit for our new QA Automation Engineer opportunity here at Drops!\\n\\n**About us**\\n\\nOur goal at Drops is to ensure effective language learning through a delightful, seamless, gamified experience. We strive to be the #1 app for vocabulary learning and we’re very much on the way there! Our app has been live on the App Store for over 3 years, covering 37 languages, serving 20 million users across the globe and has been featured on both the App Store and Play Store multiple times. We were super chuffed to be awarded ‘App of the Year 2018’ by Google on the Play Store and have been featured by TechCrunch, FastCo, Forbes, CNN, Bloomberg, VentureBeat and many more. In short, we’re a small, efficient team spread mostly across Europe, achieving great things the remote way!

We optimise for impact, not headcount.\\n* We carefully consider tradeoffs in technology and processes that could lead to increased complexity.\\n* We live the TypeScript life. We strive for code quality over quantity and stick to a simple development process, spending more time creating and less time in admin.\\n* We use React Native on the frontend, sharing around 98% of the code between Android, iOS and Web. We use Typescript on the backend too!\\n* We’re believers in functional programming. We concentrate state, minimise side effects and abstract when necessary.\\n* We automate where there is a logical business case to do so..\\n* Our biggest challenge is managing the complexity of sharing code across a suite of apps.\\n* We don’t believe in hierarchy. Autonomy, ownership and passion are the secret ingredients behind Drops. Clear, honest communication is the linchpin of our culture, success and independence.\\n\\n**Benefits**\\n\\n*  All the perks of remote working\\n*  An awesomely compact 19 person team\\n*  Yearly educational allowance\\n*  Fitness allowance\\n*  High-end Apple hardware and ergonomic accessories\\n*  30 days of holiday per year (including Christmas and other holidays)\\n* ✈️ Quarterly team gathering somewhere in the world (Amsterdam, Iceland, Lisbon and Budapest were previous locations)\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n **What are we looking for?**\\n\\nWe’re looking to expand our QA team with an inquisitive, forward thinking automation engineer to support our development team across a suite of Drops apps. You’ll be responsible for automating tests in key areas of the applications. From golden path to intrinsic gameplay functionality, you’ll be looking to guarantee quality and keep regression at bay!\\n\\nYou should have a strong foundation in testing, experienced and knowledgeable in both automation and manual practices. You can prioritise workload and are skilled at finding bugs others have difficulty spotting, writing automation test scripts from a blank canvas where appropriate. \\n\\n# Requirements\\n* You can see a problem from the product, development, and user’ perspective.\\n* You have great hard skills but even better soft skills.\\n* You’re competent in contemporary JS based QA technologies and toolsets (Cypress, Cucumber/Behave feature files, AWS; S3, Lambda, RDS, Cognito).\\n* You’ve got hands on experience with CI tooling (Jenkins, BuildKite, Bitrise, etc).\\n* You’ve got experience in api, load and security testing.\\n* You’ve worked within an agile development team.\\n* You know when to manually test and when to automate.\\n* You’re Proficient in testing practices such as BDD, TDD and competent in declarative testing.\\n* You’re able to identify priorities and application hotspots for testing.\\n* You have introspective tendencies and are looking for a position where you can grow, fast. \\n\\n#Location\\n- EU-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

We believe that online merchants should have an easy-to-implement solution that offers customers an alternative to instant payment, hence giving customers a chance to evaluate the purchase before actual payment. The last 4 years, ViaBill has grown from our first office in an art gallery to multiple offices throughout the world and from a handful of customers to handling transactions worth more than $150M per year.&nbsp;</p><p>At ViaBill, we know that becoming the best at something is not easy. It takes skill, hard work, and an unmatched level of ambition. We believe in these ideals and offer a job with great potential for career development, freedom to unfold skills and competencies, and an environment that values different perspectives. Continuous improvement, learning, and growth are encouraged and even rewarded. From engineers to sales, we’re on the hunt for exceptional talent to help us scale our business and get ViaBill into the hands of millions of people.</p><p>The developer team consists of highly-motivated individuals who work remotely. We collaborate much like open source projects with core maintainers for our services. Each developer has a high level of freedom working in a flat hierarchy with a streamlined process where the domain experts are easily available.</p><p>We are constantly developing and striving to not only scale, but to improve our software solutions through automating processes and removing inefficiencies wherever possible. We value people who challenge the status quo.</p><p>We work with a very rapid release schedule - often releasing multiple times per day - giving us a quick and motivating feed-back loop. This allows us to experiment and adopt new trends/frameworks quickly. This also makes it very easy for a developer to see their effect on business!</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Remote = No commute</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work/life balance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Working with cool, modern technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Meetups</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Clean code</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Agile</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We design and conduct In-Home Usage Testing (IHUT) locally and nationally to provide actual user feedback to companies and market research firms to evaluate products, packaging, related product instructions and more.&nbsp;</p><p>We leverage our network of private panels (In-Home Usage Testers) to provide product testers to companies for evaluating the in-home experience with a wide variety of products to ensure proper product certification and greater market access.&nbsp;</p><p>Please note that although this job can be done from home&nbsp;95% of the time, very occasionally In-Home Product Testers may be asked to visit the client's office, laboratory, store, warehouse or factory for training or meetings (visits are local and scheduled at no more than 20 minutes drive from the In-Home Usage Tester address). These optional visits are also paid by the hour.&nbsp;</p><p>During your application process, we will determine your consumer profile and establish what products would be suitable for you to test according to your demographics, lifestyle, consumer behavior, skills, hobbies and ability. Research questionnaires are used to identify and target certain types of consumers, to ensure the right participants are engaged and to achieve the representative sample needed. Job candidates for In-Home Usage Testing are also screened to meet the client’s needs for the project to ensure that the product is one that they qualify to test and that they have a balance of demographics and attitudes.&nbsp;</p><p>Participation in these product testing and consumer panels is always free, secure and private. In-Home Usage Testing is a quick, easy and fun way to make extra cash by telling big brands what you think about their upcoming products and services in the&nbsp;American&nbsp;market.</p><p><br><strong>Main duties:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Sign and return non-disclosure agreements before the product to be&nbsp;tested is shipped.
