Its complicated administrative processes contribute largely to its struggle to keep up with rapidly advancing technology, resulting in bad experiences for both patients and healthcare professionals alike.</p>  <p>As the first digital hospital, we are rebuilding the healthcare experience from scratch. This is what allows us to provide patients with an outstanding level of care that we would love to experience ourselves.</p>  <p>Backed by renowned international investors, we are helping an ever-growing number of patients receive the highest quality of medical procedures the UK has to offer. To help us maintain this level of care, we need to expand our XXX team with highly motivated and passionate people who thrive in a fast-paced and dynamic work environment.</p>  <p>—-</p>  <p><strong>What you will do:</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Production and management of medical content for both patients and our team</li>   <li>Researching and developing a strong understanding of a variety of different medical and surgical procedures across a range of specialties</li>   <li>Training new and existing staff on those procedures</li>   <li>Management and upkeep of the company knowledge database</li>   <li>Organisation and management of patient care packages</li>   <li>Communication and troubleshooting across a number of different departments</li>   <li>Communication with and management of the remote medical team.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>What you bring to the table:</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Are fluent in both written and spoken English (no German skills required)</li>   <li>Have completed a degree (preferably in the field of healthcare)</li>   <li>Have previous experience with teaching small groups</li>   <li>Have previous experience with researching and writing medical content</li>   <li>Have outstanding organisational skills and can juggle a lot of projects at the same time</li>   <li>Are a fast learner, want to quickly assume responsibility and gain ownership of your own projects</li>   <li>Enjoy continually working with a number of people from different departments within the company including Patient Care, Marketing and Product and a remote team.</li>   <li>Work experience in the startup environment is a plus</li>  </ul>  <p>—-</p>  <p><strong>What the crew is like and why I love working here:</strong></p>  <p>Our Medbelle family is a small and truly international team (75%+ internationals). We pride ourselves on our company culture that’s focused on building a great service with a professional emphasis on numbers and growth.</p>  <p>As a typical Berlin startup, we, of course, have the usual fun stuff: free coffee &amp; British tea, fruits, pancake Tuesdays, an amazing Villa in Kreuzberg, Friday memes and team events we probably shouldn’t talk about here. But what I love most about working for Medbelle is the honest desire to help improve the experiences of our patients – that’s what keeps us motivated and driven.</p>  <p>We move quickly. If you are a great match, we can cover the initial phone interviews, an on-site interview with me and a chat with the founders all within two weeks. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>  <p>Sarah</p>  <p>Head of Patient Care</p> </div><a href='https://medbelle.breezy.hr/p/09e505d2e40d01-medical-quality-manager' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this position</a>",

Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast&nbsp;software and are the basis for&nbsp;our company culture.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3. Together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone. These principles govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. We strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><ol><li>Quality: Strive to deliver software that is reliable, stable, and free of defects.</li><li>Positivity: Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</li><li>Scalable Thinking: Make things work well as they scale up or down.</li><li>Bias Towards Simplicity: Try to make things as simple as possible.</li><li>Humility: Assume others are smart. Give credit to others for their&nbsp;ideas and work.</li><li>Honesty: Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</li><li>Ownership: Own your projects. Deliver on time. Coordinate with others. Escalate when stuck.</li><li>Community Focus: Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers,&nbsp;and users.</li><li>Commitment: Participate in the decision process. Once a decision is made, work to make it a success, even if you disagreed.</li></ol><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;feels good to team members, customers, partners, investors, and open source users of Hazelcast. If we find that it does not feel good, we need to improve our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We believe in change through accountability, debate, ambition and respect for the communities and individuals that make up our networked universe(s).&nbsp;</p><p>Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to control a large group of people from the top down, which is why military organizations, industrial corporations and nation-states have relied on it so heavily. But hierarchies carry their own institutional costs, which means that a regulatory bureaucracy can focus only on a few issues at a time – generally those most important to the people at the top or to the dominant groups in the ruling coalition.</p><p>But what if we can organize this company to embody the very structures of those network communication technologies and digital platforms we hope to build? What if this can enable us to take on all those dinosaur hierarchies as equals - and more than equals? What if self-regulation and social cooperation can be amplified and intensified in this way to empower all of us to care for our selves and ourselves without any authority?</p><p>That’s why Mav Farm is&nbsp;stigmergic. Like the products we build, stigmergy is a form of self-organization social network. It's the principle that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergic networks are superior to hierarchies, in that they are not slowed down by bureaucratic permission-seeking, communication asymmetries and problems associated with top-down coordination. Instead stigmergy allows individual contributors or cells to freely work within a shared platform, contributing to a shared goal as they see fit.</p><p>With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project. The innovations of individual contributors can freely travel throughout the chain when others wish to adopt them. Think of stigmergy as a heuristic approach to improving everything, allowing all of us to be agile and flexible.</p><p>This is our shorthand way of saying that we don’t have any management, and nobody “reports to” anybody else. We do have Founders, but even they aren't your manager. This company is yours to steer—toward opportunities and away from risks, toward high performance and quick creative fixes. You have the power to green-light projects. You have the power to ship products.</p><p>In this stigmergic structure every organizational barrier is removed between your work and the customer enjoying that work. Every company will tell you that “the customer is boss,” but here that statement has weight. There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what our customers want, and then giving it to them.</p><p>So far, our team has designed, architected and built things like: motion tracking in video, object recognition in video, machine learning recommender systems, real-time graphics shaders, AR shopping experiences, business intelligence dashboards, marketplace apps, video streaming apps and more. Our sights are set high! Where will you take us?</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full medical, dental and vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Retirement/401K Plan</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited PTO</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible schedules</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life &amp; Disability coverage</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data.</p><h4><strong>Our Hiring Process</strong></h4><p>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</p><p>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal!</p><p><strong><em>*Our positions are fully remote and to ensure compliance with all applicable labor laws, are open to U.S.-based applicants only. In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, New York, or New Jersey as it is difficult for distributed companies like ours to hire in those locations.*</em></strong></p><h4><strong>Our Culture</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>We’re a remote company.</strong> We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and workcations, including one annual trip that is partially funded by the company.</li><li><strong>We work hard and move fast. </strong>We’re working on a lot of different websites with varying underlying technologies. You’ll see a lot of pages and forms and there’s not a lot of automation. Maintaining quality while working on so much requires more than just checking boxes, you’ll need to think critically.</li><li><strong>Again, we’re a remote company.</strong> That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension — <em>extremely</em> important. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “pull tickets and check in code” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes, <em>improving</em> processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</li></ul><h4><strong>What we’re looking for</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Consistency / Reliability.</strong> T<strong>his is a remote position. </strong>You’ll be responsible for keeping the trains moving.</li><li><strong>Strong Communication. </strong>Written communication must be clear.</li><li><strong>Professionalism. </strong>See This is Professionalism article above.</li><li><strong>Gmail / Spreadsheet Proficiency.</strong></li><li><strong>Nice to haves:</strong> Technical focus in schooling<strong> (e.g., Code School, CS, or MIS Degree).</strong></li></ul><h4><strong>About the Position</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>No prior QA experience is required.</strong> Our QA is a manual process and does not require an enterprise QA skill set.</li><li><strong>Full-time or contracting positions.</strong> At the outset, your schedule should be flexible as work ebbs and flows.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://crometrics.com/qa-analyst/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Like any other industry, executives within CRE need to be informed and connected to do their jobs well. And in CRE, doing your job well means doing smarter deals and more of them.</p><p>Our mission is to inform, connect and advance the commercial real estate community to do more business.</p><p>We aspire to be the most data-driven and humanizing digital media, live events and intelligence platform in the galaxy and through this effort, drive the industry to do smarter business. From events and news to branded content and video, our singular voice, attitude and perspective reaches 18 million all-digital readers and more than 100,000 industry insiders who attend our 300+ Bisnow events each year. Operating in more than 50 cities across North America and Europe, we tend to think globally, but strive to connect people hyper-locally.</p><p>We are seeking a Senior Quality Assurance Engineer to join our engineering team and help institute industry standard QA processes to help accelerate code acceptance, general functional testing, regression testing and to aid in deployment of our systems and services. This person will own the entire testing lifecycle and implement best practices to help take our software quality to the next level. As our team is still small, this is an excellent opportunity for someone ambitious to join and help establish guidelines and procedures for how we should test our software and what automated testing systems we should be investing in.</p><p><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong></p><ul><li>Review product specifications and work with product stakeholders to validate expected behavior of all products</li><li>Plan and build out procedures for testing various software setups including RESTful APIs and browser based web applications.</li><li>Review new code and develop plans with the engineering owner to review and validate PRs.</li><li>Execute test cases (manual or automated) and analyze results.</li><li>Identify and log bugs accurately and quickly in Jira.</li><li>Perform regression testing in an automated fashion to ensure daily operations are not impacted.</li><li>Help troubleshoot issues and work with customer service to surface issues to engineering.</li></ul><p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS</strong></p><ul><li>3-5 years of QA testing experience in a dynamic engineering environment.</li><li>Knowledge of general software QA methodologies, tools and processes.</li><li>Experience with automated testing tools and suites.</li><li>Experience planning and executing software tests.</li><li>Some Javascript experience, PHP experience is not required but would be great to have!</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS?</strong></p><ul><li>We have a highly competitive compensation structure that rewards those who win, incredibly well</li><li>Vacation is important and we want you to take it. We’re also not into bureaucracy so tracking vacation sounds insane and that’s why we decided to offer unlimited vacation</li><li>Health, dental, vision, commuter, short term disability and 401k benefits are included for all our employees</li><li>You’ll get to work with smart, passionate, driven, ambitious, kind, caring and mindful people and will rarely experience an overload of policies, bureaucracy or toxicity (the latter, we do not tolerate. Period)</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT ARE THE DRAWBACKS?</strong></p><p>At Bisnow, we believe the interview process is a two way street. We ask that you interview us during this process as much as we plan to interview you. Most companies wouldn’t dream to include drawbacks on a job description – but we know were not perfect and don’t pretend to be. So here are the most common drawbacks voiced by people who did not find Bisnow to be a good fit.</p><ul><li>Lack of structure. we’ve gone from a handful of entrepreneurs to a company with 100 employees relatively quickly and our management team are mostly in their thirties which means we don’t have decades of experience. Were figuring things out as we go, so if you’re someone who needs structure in place, were probably not the place for you but if you consider yourself an entrepreneur and want to help figure things out with a smart team of like-minded go getters, this could be your dream career.</li><li>Chaotic at times, Bisnow should put proper policies in place. Mario Andretti once said that if things seem under control, you’re probably not going fast enough. We don’t encourage chaos but we do see a healthy amount of it as a result of exciting growth and were also not big fans of bureaucracy and find the more policies we implement the more bureaucratic things become.</li><li>Long hours, not a lot of time off, unlimited vacation means no vacation. We encourage taking long vacations and time off and we truly believe that those sorts of trips can lead to more productivity when people come back and feel more inspired by new ideas. We do work long hours and for some people that’s not ideal. As entrepreneurs, we have to love what we do or else we wouldnt be particularly good at it and when you love what you do, you dont really separate work and play but rather integrate the two.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://careers.bisnow.com/o/senior-quality-assurance-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
