We like to build stuff… sometimes complicated stuff… and sometimes it breaks! So we’re looking for a confident and ambitious Senior QA Test Engineer to join our distributed team.</p><p>We do things a little differently, basing all our solutions on open source products, having flexible working hours and real team mentality. Our work covers web design, CRM, app development and branding for Charities and non-profit organisations across the country. Our clients include Charities such as Wikimedia and Farm Africa, galleries such as the Photographers Gallery and Craft Central but also companies, trade associations and government bodies. We are also developing several open source products that are used by non-profit organisations worldwide and the role will be uniquely rewarding as you will have the opportunity to influence and support these valuable projects. The ideal candidate will be an experienced QA engineer who has worked on many complex web applications in the past.</p><p>The role will involve a mixture of writing and executing manual test scripts, feeding back to developers on bugs or issues noted. There may also be some future work on automation testing although the primary focus for this role will be manual testing. The ideal candidate would have some existing CRM and CMS experience (ideally Drupal), be an expert in developing comprehensive test plans and submitting bug reports. SQL knowledge and the ability to setup a basic development environment with Git would be a major advantage but are not essential for the role. What we're looking for is someone who can grasp concepts quickly, has great attention to detail, and loves picking holes in (other people’s!) logic. In short, we’re a team of self confessed geeks who love tinkering and tweaking until something is just right, and we’re looking for someone who thinks and acts like us to join our growing team.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is a remote contractor position.</strong></p><p><strong>The ideal candidate will have:</strong></p><ul><li>5+ years experience developing test plans for complex web applications</li><li>Experience with implementing solid testing methodologies and processes within an existing organisation</li><li>SQL skills a plus</li><li>Basic git skills and an understanding of git workflows a plus</li><li>A keen interest in developing open source technologies for non-profit organisations</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://www.compucorp.co.uk/content/application-form-qa-engineer-remote' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Compucorp Ltd.</h3>            <div><p>We&nbsp;like&nbsp;to&nbsp;build&nbsp;stuff,&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;complicated&nbsp;stuff,&nbsp;for&nbsp;people&nbsp;who&nbsp;like&nbsp;to&nbsp;make&nbsp;a&nbsp;difference.</p><p>We&nbsp;do&nbsp;things&nbsp;a&nbsp;little&nbsp;differently,&nbsp;basing&nbsp;all&nbsp;our&nbsp;solutions&nbsp;on&nbsp;open&nbsp;source&nbsp;products,&nbsp;having&nbsp;flexible&nbsp;working hours&nbsp;and&nbsp;a&nbsp;real&nbsp;team&nbsp;mentality.</p><p>We're&nbsp;passionate&nbsp;about&nbsp;the&nbsp;platforms&nbsp;we&nbsp;work&nbsp;with&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;communities&nbsp;which&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;part&nbsp;of.

Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data.</div><div><br></div><div>A/B Test Engineers leverage knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS to build out experimentation and personalization for conversion rate optimization. Additionally, they have familiarity with CRO platforms like Optimizely, VWO, and Google Optimize. They must also be comfortable working to validate concepts by choosing the cheapest route to MVP versus over-engineering.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in checking out the swell people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a></div><div><br></div><div><h3>Our Hiring Process</h3></div><div>We’re glad you’re interested in working with us. We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</div><div><br></div><div>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal!</div><div><br></div><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>. Please read it and if you’re willing to work this way, read on!</div><div><br></div><div><em>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:matthew.gossage@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>matthew.gossage@crometrics.com</a>&nbsp;or</em><em>&nbsp;<a href='mailto:mike@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>mike@crometrics.com</a>.&nbsp;</em></div><div><br></div><div><span><em>Our positions are fully remote and to ensure compliance with all applicable labor laws, are open to U.S.-based applicants only. In general, we are not hiring in Washington state, Oregon state, San Francisco, New York, or New Jersey as it is difficult for distributed companies like ours to hire in those locations.</em></span></div><div><br></div><div><h3>Our Culture</h3></div><ul><li><span>We’re a remote company.</span>&nbsp;We are spread out all over the country and enjoy the flexibility remote working affords. Want to go on a mountain bike ride in the middle of the day? Cool, don’t forget your helmet! Need to pick the kids up from school? Nice, you’ve got parent of the year in the bag. We stay connected through Slack and&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/culture/workcations/' rel='nofollow'>workcations</a>, including one annual trip that is partially funded by the company.</li><li><span>We value elegant code as much as you do, but we move fast.</span>&nbsp;We’re writing code that runs&nbsp;<em>on top of</em>&nbsp;existing websites. Some tests only run for a few days before disappearing (though&nbsp;some do so well they become a permanent part of the client’s site). There will be polling patterns and liberal use of&nbsp;<code>!important</code>.</li><li><span><span>Again, we’re a remote company.</span>&nbsp;That makes communication — including writing and reading comprehension —&nbsp;<em>extremely</em>&nbsp;important. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers and writers. This is not a simple “pull tickets and check in code” gig. Successful applicants enjoy the process of defining and clarifying specs, documenting processes,&nbsp;<em>improving</em>&nbsp;processes, and uploading custom emoji to Slack.</span></li></ul>            </div><div>How to apply:<br>Interested in working with us?

We like to build stuff… sometimes complicated stuff… and sometimes it breaks! So we’re looking for a confident and ambitious Senior QA Test Engineer to join our distributed team.<br /><br />We do things a little differently, basing all our solutions on open source products, having flexible working hours and real team mentality. Our work covers web design, CRM, app development and branding for Charities and non-profit organisations across the country. Our clients include Charities such as Wikimedia and Farm Africa, galleries such as the Photographers Gallery and Craft Central but also companies, trade associations and government bodies. We are also developing several open source products that are used by non-profit organisations worldwide and the role will be uniquely rewarding as you will have the opportunity to influence and support these valuable projects. The ideal candidate will be an experienced QA engineer who has worked on many complex web applications in the past.<br /><br />The role will involve a mixture of writing and executing manual test scripts, feeding back to developers on bugs or issues noted. There may also be some future work on automation testing although the primary focus for this role will be manual testing. The ideal candidate would have some existing CRM and CMS experience (ideally Drupal), be an expert in developing comprehensive test plans and submitting bug reports. SQL knowledge and the ability to setup a basic development environment with Git would be a major advantage but are not essential for the role. What we're looking for is someone who can grasp concepts quickly, has great attention to detail, and loves picking holes in (other people’s!) logic. In short, we’re a team of self confessed geeks who love tinkering and tweaking until something is just right, and we’re looking for someone who thinks and acts like us to join our growing team.<br /><br />How to apply<br /><br />Click the link below to start your application:<br /><br />https://www.compucorp.co.uk/content/application-form-qa-engineer-remote<br />",

This time, we're overhauling our desktop and mobile offerings and preparing to launch Lonely Planet into the 21st—nay, the 27th century. The ultimate goal is to create a kind of hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy for travelers: a way of accessing rich, powerful, and contextual information about people, places, and things, whether you're on your computer in SOMA or on your smartphone in Kandahar.</p><p>Based on that description, you may be tempted to say that we're building an encyclopedia. Not so fast. Instead of a general reference tool, we're building a targeted searchlight for road warriors, a cicerone for globetrotters, a traveling companion that quickly and intelligently reports on everything from popular phrases to wall outlets to lethal animals. Because you have better things to do than getting eaten by a Komodo dragon on your honeymoon. What you see right now—our current website and apps—are the preface to a much grander vision that we hope to implement in the very near future. To that end, we're hiring the best and brightest from all over the globe with the intention of forming a world-class technology team. In other words: don't think of us as a company that only prints books. We're a technology company, and we're pretty stoked about it.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexi-time</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>15 - 25 days</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Choose your own machine</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Conferences and training</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Casual work environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work alongside a talented, driven team</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
