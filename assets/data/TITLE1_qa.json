Is finding issues and inconsistencies one of your strengths? Well don’t look any further, because we actually want someone who points out our flaws! To be more precise: the flaws in our A/B-tests.</p><p>We want to enlist your skills in the fight against broken and buggy A/B tests. Broken tests not only mean invalid test results, but also a poor user experience on our clients’ sites. Help break’ our tests so we can continue making the web better and more user friendly!</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be Doing</strong></p><p>As a&nbsp;<strong>QA Analyst&nbsp;</strong>you will be responsible for one of the most important parts (if not THE most important part of A/B-testing): making sure the A/B tests we develop actually work the way they should. Many sites are running broken A/B tests, we want you to help us avoid that.</p><ul><li>You’ll be using Browserstack (or other tools) for checking the A/B-test on different devices and browsers to try and break’ our A/B tests. We want to be 120% sure our A/B tests work on all devices and browsers the way they should.</li><li>You’ll think of all the possible scenarios a user can encounter and use the A/B test variation and will walk through those scenarios.</li><li>You’ll stay up-to-date about the newest devices, browser updates, and operating systems (OS).</li><li>You will report bugs, issues, inconsistencies, etc. in a detailed, clear and constructive way to the Developer. You will not only point out what is not working as it should, but you will also try to troubleshoot and point out why it is not working.</li><li>You will keep everyone involved in the A/B test in the loop.</li><li>You will improve our QA process by thinking of and trying out new ways of working and implementing them in the team. You’re our resident QA scientist!</li></ul><p><strong>About Dexter Agency</strong></p><p>We wanna help create a great life for our team, for our clients and for the world.</p><p>The way we do it is through creating a better internet experience for everyone through Conversion Optimization and Google Ads optimization.

One of the projects we are involved in is teaching University Students from the Cambodian Children’s Fund how to get a well-paid job online.</li><li><strong>Fully remote team</strong></li></ul><p><strong>At Dexter we believe that people should be able to design their own life. Our team is able to work from wherever they want. As remote workers we work from co-working spaces, beaches (just remember to wear clothes during video calls), the mountains or from home.</strong></p><p>Our goal is to be world-class at what we do. We believe in focusing on a few things and doing them well. That is why we only do Conversion Optimization and Google Ads Optimization.</p><p><strong>What we offer</strong></p><p>This is the deck of cards you’ll get to play with at Dexter:</p><ol><li>Work on what you love</li><li><strong>Work from wherever you want – Or at our offices in Malta, Stockholm or Bangkok</strong></li><li><strong>You’ll get cash to set up your office the way you want it (Comfy chair, nice desk, maybe even another monitor, anything to help you be happy in your workspace)</strong></li><li>Competitive salary</li><li>Bonuses</li><li>A supportive team and leadership that will help you evolve (We like to think we’re also pretty fun to work with as well  )</li><li>Get educated by the top Conversion Optimization and Internet Marketing experts in the world</li><li>Gym membership (Or spend it for other activities.

You actually enjoy making things perfect.</li><li>This means that OK’ is not good enough for you; an A/B test has to be exactly right.</li><li>You don’t mind repeating the same actions multiple times in order to make sure a test works.</li><li>You are persistent and someone who always carries through.</li><li>You have excellent knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li><li>You honestly and respectfully point out issues and mistakes, but aren’t too shy to be direct when necessary.</li><li><strong>You are an excellent communicator. This is a remote position, so good, frequent and clear communication is essential. That means emails, Slack messages, and the occasional video chat (pants optional).</strong></li><li>It’s not a must, but if you have experience with A/B-testing, that will be considered a plus.</li><li><strong>You are fluent in English. You are a good communicator, patient, friendly and honest.</strong></li><li><strong>You are flexible with your schedule. If you work remotely, you may be in a timezone different from that of your co-workers or clients. Therefore, occasional calls early in the morning or late at night may be unavoidable.

We like to build stuff… sometimes complicated stuff… and sometimes it breaks! So we’re looking for a confident and ambitious Senior QA Test Engineer to join our distributed team.</p><p>We do things a little differently, basing all our solutions on open source products, having flexible working hours and real team mentality. Our work covers web design, CRM, app development and branding for Charities and non-profit organisations across the country. Our clients include Charities such as Wikimedia and Farm Africa, galleries such as the Photographers Gallery and Craft Central but also companies, trade associations and government bodies. We are also developing several open source products that are used by non-profit organisations worldwide and the role will be uniquely rewarding as you will have the opportunity to influence and support these valuable projects. The ideal candidate will be an experienced QA engineer who has worked on many complex web applications in the past.</p><p>The role will involve a mixture of writing and executing manual test scripts, feeding back to developers on bugs or issues noted. There may also be some future work on automation testing although the primary focus for this role will be manual testing. The ideal candidate would have some existing CRM and CMS experience (ideally Drupal), be an expert in developing comprehensive test plans and submitting bug reports. SQL knowledge and the ability to setup a basic development environment with Git would be a major advantage but are not essential for the role. What we’re looking for is someone who can grasp concepts quickly, has great attention to detail, and loves picking holes in (other people’s!) logic. In short, we’re a team of self confessed geeks who love tinkering and tweaking until something is just right, and we’re looking for someone who thinks and acts like us to join our growing team.</p><p><strong>Please note that this is a remote contractor position.</strong></p><h2><strong>The idea candidate will have:</strong></h2><ul><li>– 5+ years experience developing test plans for complex web applications</li><li>– Experience with implementing solid testing methodologies and processes within an existing organisation</li><li>– SQL skills a plus</li><li>– Basic git skills and an understanding of git workflows a plus</li><li>– A keen interest in developing open source technologies for non-profit organisations</li></ul><p></p><div> <a href='https://www.compucorp.co.uk/content/application-form-qa-engineer-remote' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a></div></div>",

This time, we're overhauling our desktop and mobile offerings and preparing to launch Lonely Planet into the 21st—nay, the 27th century. The ultimate goal is to create a kind of hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy for travelers: a way of accessing rich, powerful, and contextual information about people, places, and things, whether you're on your computer in SOMA or on your smartphone in Kandahar.</p><p>Based on that description, you may be tempted to say that we're building an encyclopedia. Not so fast. Instead of a general reference tool, we're building a targeted searchlight for road warriors, a cicerone for globetrotters, a traveling companion that quickly and intelligently reports on everything from popular phrases to wall outlets to lethal animals. Because you have better things to do than getting eaten by a Komodo dragon on your honeymoon. What you see right now—our current website and apps—are the preface to a much grander vision that we hope to implement in the very near future. To that end, we're hiring the best and brightest from all over the globe with the intention of forming a world-class technology team. In other words: don't think of us as a company that only prints books. We're a technology company, and we're pretty stoked about it.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexi-time</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>15 - 25 days</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Choose your own machine</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Conferences and training</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Casual work environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work alongside a talented, driven team</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
