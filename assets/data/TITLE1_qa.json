    "content": "About the role<br /><br />Are you the QA engineer to help us implement a robust QA process for our open source platforms developed for non-profit organisations? We like to build stuff… sometimes complicated stuff… and sometimes it breaks! So we’re looking for a confident and ambitious Senior QA Test Engineer to join our distributed team.<br /><br />We do things a little differently, basing all our solutions on open source products, having flexible working hours and real team mentality. Our work covers web design, CRM, app development and branding for Charities and non-profit organisations across the country. Our clients include Charities such as Wikimedia and Farm Africa, galleries such as the Photographers Gallery and Craft Central but also companies, trade associations and government bodies. We are also developing several open source products that are used by non-profit organisations worldwide and the role will be uniquely rewarding as you will have the opportunity to influence and support these valuable projects. The ideal candidate will be an experienced QA engineer who has worked on many complex web applications in the past.<br /><br />The role will involve a mixture of writing and executing manual test scripts, feeding back to developers on bugs or issues noted. There may also be some future work on automation testing although the primary focus for this role will be manual testing. The ideal candidate would have some existing CRM and CMS experience (ideally Drupal), be an expert in developing comprehensive test plans and submitting bug reports. SQL knowledge and the ability to setup a basic development environment with Git would be a major advantage but are not essential for the role. What we're looking for is someone who can grasp concepts quickly, has great attention to detail, and loves picking holes in (other people’s!) logic. In short, we’re a team of self confessed geeks who love tinkering and tweaking until something is just right, and we’re looking for someone who thinks and acts like us to join our growing team.<br /><br />Please note that this is a remote contractor position.<br /><br />The ideal candidate will have:<br />- 5+ years experience developing test plans for complex web applications<br />- Experience with implementing solid testing methodologies and processes within an existing organisation<br />- SQL skills a plus<br />- Basic git skills and an understanding of git workflows a plus<br />- A keen interest in developing open source technologies for non-profit organisations<br /><br />How to apply<br /><br />Click the link below to start your application:<br /><br />https://www.compucorp.co.uk/content/application-form-qa-engineer-remote",

This time, we're overhauling our desktop and mobile offerings and preparing to launch Lonely Planet into the 21st—nay, the 27th century. The ultimate goal is to create a kind of hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy for travelers: a way of accessing rich, powerful, and contextual information about people, places, and things, whether you're on your computer in SOMA or on your smartphone in Kandahar.</p><p>Based on that description, you may be tempted to say that we're building an encyclopedia. Not so fast. Instead of a general reference tool, we're building a targeted searchlight for road warriors, a cicerone for globetrotters, a traveling companion that quickly and intelligently reports on everything from popular phrases to wall outlets to lethal animals. Because you have better things to do than getting eaten by a Komodo dragon on your honeymoon. What you see right now—our current website and apps—are the preface to a much grander vision that we hope to implement in the very near future. To that end, we're hiring the best and brightest from all over the globe with the intention of forming a world-class technology team. In other words: don't think of us as a company that only prints books. We're a technology company, and we're pretty stoked about it.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexi-time</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>15 - 25 days</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Choose your own machine</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Conferences and training</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Casual work environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work alongside a talented, driven team</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
