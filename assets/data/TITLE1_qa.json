We empower designers and marketers to create beautiful, interactive content experiences, all without the need to write a code or test in all those pesky browsers.\\n\\nOur customers include some of the world’s leading brands, such as Mashable, GE, Red Bull, United Airlines, and IBM.\\n\\nWe are well-funded and venture-backed by prominent investors including Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.\\n\\nAbout the Product\\n\\nDesigning and building the Ceros platform is no easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and Quality Engineers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.\\n\\nAbout the Team\\n\\nAs part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward. We find a way.\\n\\nWe have a very dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it’s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO’s atrocious spelling.\\n\\nThis position is 100% remote, but we are primarily in U.S. Eastern time zone and prefer candidates who can have an overlapping work schedule with the rest of the team.\\n\\nAbout the Opportunity\\n\\nAffectionately referred to internally as the “Day-Ruiners”, our Quality Engineers work hand in hand with developers, aiming to ensure releases are bug-free. Day to day responsibilities include writing automated tests, manually testing new features, creating and maintaining test-cases in TestRail, working with our support team to triage and document defects found in production, and assisting with releases.&nbsp;\\n\\nYou should be proficient with at least one programming language (our automated test suite is written in Javascript, so Javascript experience is a big plus). You should understand how web applications work and where things can break down. Proficiency using browser developer tools and being comfortable with the command line is also a must. Most importantly, you need to care deeply about our customers and their experience working with us.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* 2+ years experience manually testing with an agile software team\\n\\n* 2+ years experience writing automated tests\\n\\n* Comfortable in at least one programming language (Bonus if it’s javascript)\\n\\n* Comfortable with the linux command line&nbsp;\\n\\n* Understanding of CI/CD pipelines and tooling\\n\\n* Understanding of the different types of software testing\\n\\n* Strong attention to detail\\n\\n* Excellent written and oral communication skills\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBonus\\n\\n\\n* Experience load testing web applications\\n\\n* Experience performance testing javascript based applications in the browser\\n\\n* Experience testing web application security\\n\\n* Experience testing a visual design application of some kind\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext Steps\\n\\nIf you want to be part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us. We’re a company of passionate, honest, and sometimes silly people, so don’t be afraid to express yourself.\\n\\nKey Things to Know\\n\\n\\n* This is a remote role\\n\\n* We want you to start ASAP\\n\\n* This is a full-time position\\n\\n* Unlimited vacation days\\n\\n* Competitive salary\\n\\n* Stock options\\n\\n* Premium health insurance\\n\\n* Ceros does not provide sponsorship for this role\\n\\n\\n  </div> </div>",

We believe that online merchants should have an easy-to-implement solution that offers customers an alternative to instant payment, hence giving customers a chance to evaluate the purchase before actual payment. The last 4 years, ViaBill has grown from our first office in an art gallery to multiple offices throughout the world and from a handful of customers to handling transactions worth more than $150M per year.&nbsp;</p><p>At ViaBill, we know that becoming the best at something is not easy. It takes skill, hard work, and an unmatched level of ambition. We believe in these ideals and offer a job with great potential for career development, freedom to unfold skills and competencies, and an environment that values different perspectives. Continuous improvement, learning, and growth are encouraged and even rewarded. From engineers to sales, we’re on the hunt for exceptional talent to help us scale our business and get ViaBill into the hands of millions of people.</p><p>The developer team consists of highly-motivated individuals who work remotely. We collaborate much like open source projects with core maintainers for our services. Each developer has a high level of freedom working in a flat hierarchy with a streamlined process where the domain experts are easily available.</p><p>We are constantly developing and striving to not only scale, but to improve our software solutions through automating processes and removing inefficiencies wherever possible. We value people who challenge the status quo.</p><p>We work with a very rapid release schedule - often releasing multiple times per day - giving us a quick and motivating feed-back loop. This allows us to experiment and adopt new trends/frameworks quickly.
