We have a fairly unusual hiring process, but it has proven to work well both for us and for potential new hires. We have found that demonstrating basic competency is the best predictor of initial qualification for working with us, followed by actual work.</div><div><br></div><div>Our process reflects that: below, we outline our values and how we work, and then ask you to complete a small task. Assuming we like your response, we will hire you for a “paid interview” where you start working with us for a small number of hours each week. If both parties like working together, we expand the relationship. If not, we go our separate ways and both sides “won” in the deal!</div><div><br></div><div>This short essay sums up the philosophy we operate by:&nbsp;<a href='http://arches.io/2014/03/this-is-professionalism/' rel='nofollow'>This is Professionalism</a>.

Of those who pass, 1 in 5 crash in the first 6 months. That’s unacceptable.</p><p>Our technology helps learners find top-rated instructors and access pay-as-you-go insurance, so they can pass-first time and ultimately become safer drivers.</p><p>Since launch, over 300,000 young people in the UK have used our apps, data and tech to gain their independence. We are growing quickly and are now available in over 100 towns and cities in the UK, expanding to a new one each week.</p><p>Founded in 2013, Midrive has raised over £7.5m to date from a respected group of well-connected and supportive investors ‒ including Holiday Extras and Initial Capital. You may have heard about our recent crowdfunding round which was the 4th largest equity fund-raise target in Crowdcube's history.</p><p>We’ve recently been named #19 in the Startup 100, the annual ranking of the most game-changing and exciting new businesses launched in the last three years.

They will also have a chance to get involved in user research and contribute their own product ideas.</p><p>This role would be perfect for someone with a background in science (experience running experiments, patience to rigorously test, and skill at reporting data results from a variety of sources) who likes to break things and wants to gain experience in product management and quality assurance. Previous experience is not a must for this role, as training will be given.</p><p>What your role will involve:</p><ul><li>Designing and implementing tests.</li><li>Reviewing system requirements and tracking quality assurance metrics.</li><li>Assisting with project management, ensuring all stories have good and well understood acceptance criteria.</li><li>Conducting tests before product launches to ensure software runs smoothly and meets client needs, while being cost-effective.</li><li>Documenting these quality processes in line with the relevant guidelines.</li><li>Working with engineering leads to define a roadmap for automating quality and compliance activities.</li><li>Taking responsibility for releases (you will be managing the release process rather than a team).</li><li>Ultimately, monitoring all stages of software development to identify and resolve system malfunctions to meet quality standards.</li></ul><p>What we're looking for:</p><ul><li>An ability to understand and anticipate end users’ expectations in order to experience the products as they would.</li><li>Curiosity, initiative, and an analytical nature.</li><li>Good written and verbal communication skills.</li><li>An ability to interpret collect and interpret data, and clearly present findings.</li><li>Good numeracy.</li><li>Experience working as part of a multidisciplinary team.</li></ul>  <h4>BENEFITS</h4><p>At Midrive, we work hard, so that's why we make sure that we have best facilities to play harder! We have a host of perks: Free coffee and snacks, Wednesdays treats, Happy Hour Thursdays, team yoga sessions, and training/sharing sessions.

Of those who pass, 1 in 5 crash in the first 6 months. That’s unacceptable.<br /><br />Our technology helps learners find top-rated instructors and access pay-as-you-go insurance, so they can pass-first time and ultimately become safer drivers.<br /><br />Since launch, over 300,000 young people in the UK have used our apps, data and tech to gain their independence. We are growing quickly and are now available in over 100 towns and cities in the UK, expanding to a new one each week.<br /><br />Founded in 2013, Midrive has raised over £7.5m to date from a respected group of well-connected and supportive investors ‒ including Holiday Extras and Initial Capital. You may have heard about our recent crowdfunding round which was the 4th largest equity fund-raise target in Crowdcube's history.<br /><br />We’ve recently been named #19 in the Startup 100, the annual ranking of the most game-changing and exciting new businesses launched in the last three years. We were also named ‘Digital Business of the Year’ by the Federation of Small Businesses in 2017.<br /><br />Want to help us build the future of learner driving and insurance? Then join us!<br /><br /><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />Midrive are looking for a curious self starter with a keen eye for detail to help us clarify product requirements, and rigorously test and report on usability of our range of web and mobile products.<br /><br />This person will make a real difference to the business by making sure that features and functionality meet and exceed users’ expectations. They will also have a chance to get involved in user research and contribute their own product ideas.<br /><br />This role would be perfect for someone with a background in science (experience running experiments, patience to rigorously test, and skill at reporting data results from a variety of sources) who likes to break things and wants to gain experience in product management and quality assurance. Previous experience is not a must for this role, as training will be given.<br /><br />What your role will involve:<br /><br />*Designing and implementing tests.<br />*Reviewing system requirements and tracking quality assurance metrics.<br />*Assisting with project management, ensuring all stories have good and well understood acceptance criteria.<br />*Conducting tests before product launches to ensure software runs smoothly and meets client needs, while being cost-effective.<br />*Documenting these quality processes in line with the relevant guidelines.<br />*Working with engineering leads to define a roadmap for automating quality and compliance activities.<br />*Taking responsibility for releases (you will be managing the release process rather than a team).<br />*Ultimately, monitoring all stages of software development to identify and resolve system malfunctions to meet quality standards.<br /><br />What we're looking for:<br /><br />*An ability to understand and anticipate end users’ expectations in order to experience the products as they would.<br />*Curiosity, initiative, and an analytical nature.<br />*Good written and verbal communication skills.<br />*An ability to interpret collect and interpret data, and clearly present findings.<br />*Good numeracy.<br />*Experience working as part of a multidisciplinary team.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />At Midrive, we work hard, so that's why we make sure that we have best facilities to play harder! We have a host of perks: Free coffee and snacks, Wednesdays treats, Happy Hour Thursdays, team yoga sessions, and training/sharing sessions. We also have regular fun social events - recent adventures have included a glamping trip, escape rooms, comedy clubs, and silent discos.<br /><br />Midrive is simply a great place to work. We have a fantastic team of talented people working on an interesting product they are passionate about, and a friendly, social atmosphere. We're also a dog friendly office! Add to that competitive salaries, pension plan, and other perks, it's clear why we're a top choice.<br /><br />DIVERSITY<br /><br />Diversity and inclusion are essential values at Midrive. We know we'll do our best and most impactful work when we feel we're represented and we belong. We're proud to actively recruit and hire talented people from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status."

While the goal may seem audacious, it’s what drives us. We believe that the current state of software development is not good enough and we’re looking for others to help join our cause and improve the lives of software developers, business owners, and users who are saddled with hard-to-maintain code, cost overruns, and buggy apps.</p><p>Developers at Test Double are primarily focused on writing high quality software to solve our customer’s problems. Focus should be paid towards implementing solutions that are well-tested, easily maintained, and built with empathy for its users' needs. Many of our engagements allow us to work alongside our clients' development staff as well. Building software in close collaboration with our clients' people gives us the opportunity to learn from one another as we share our knowledge and experience as a broader team.</p><p>Knowledge sharing and continuous improvement are among our <a href='http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2016-02-24-testdouble-values' rel='nofollow'>core values</a>, so we encourage our people to share what they're learning with others. We're proud to support our Double Agents when they speak at meet ups &amp; conferences, blog, screencast, contribute to open source, and organize in their local software community. These activities are one way we can have an impact on the world beyond our day-to-day client service, so our team members support one another with encouragement, mentorship, and feedback.</p><p>Test Double is still a small and adaptable agency so we are actively enlisting the help of all of our developers to guide and improve our business. Those opportunities may entail participating in our candidate evaluation process, improving our candidate outreach, helping with account management and sales, or even improving upon our ability to keep other employees engaged and fulfilled within their careers.

This time, we're overhauling our desktop and mobile offerings and preparing to launch Lonely Planet into the 21st—nay, the 27th century. The ultimate goal is to create a kind of hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy for travelers: a way of accessing rich, powerful, and contextual information about people, places, and things, whether you're on your computer in SOMA or on your smartphone in Kandahar.</p><p>Based on that description, you may be tempted to say that we're building an encyclopedia. Not so fast. Instead of a general reference tool, we're building a targeted searchlight for road warriors, a cicerone for globetrotters, a traveling companion that quickly and intelligently reports on everything from popular phrases to wall outlets to lethal animals. Because you have better things to do than getting eaten by a Komodo dragon on your honeymoon. What you see right now—our current website and apps—are the preface to a much grander vision that we hope to implement in the very near future.
