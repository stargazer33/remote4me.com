Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast&nbsp;software and are the basis for&nbsp;our company culture.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3. Together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone. These principles govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. We strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><ol><li>Quality: Strive to deliver software that is reliable, stable, and free of defects.</li><li>Positivity: Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</li><li>Scalable Thinking: Make things work well as they scale up or down.</li><li>Bias Towards Simplicity: Try to make things as simple as possible.</li><li>Humility: Assume others are smart. Give credit to others for their&nbsp;ideas and work.</li><li>Honesty: Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</li><li>Ownership: Own your projects. Deliver on time. Coordinate with others. Escalate when stuck.</li><li>Community Focus: Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers,&nbsp;and users.</li><li>Commitment: Participate in the decision process. Once a decision is made, work to make it a success, even if you disagreed.</li></ol><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;feels good to team members, customers, partners, investors, and open source users of Hazelcast. If we find that it does not feel good, we need to improve our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

If you have strong technical skills and a passion for all things compiler, then this role could be the one for you.</p><p>As a compiler engineer you'll work as part of the compiler team to design and implement the new Luna compiler and runtime, work that is at the very core of the next phase of Luna's development. You'll have the opportunity to collaborate with a world-class team of engineers, community managers, and business developers (with experience at Bloomberg, GitHub, and PayPal, to name a few), and make your indelible mark on the future of Luna.</p><p><strong>What You'll Do</strong></p><p>As a senior compiler developer, you'll be working on the design and development of the new Luna compiler and runtime, to help support the Language's evolution. This will involve:</p><ul><li>Working to design and implement the new Luna interpreter, including the typechecker, optimiser, and foreign-language interoperability.</li><li>Theoretical and practical treatments of the theory behind Luna's type-system, and the implementation of the type inference and type checking engines for the same.</li><li>Practical work improving both the performance and capabilities of the new interpreter.</li><li>Practical work implementing front-end optimisations for Luna that improve the code that is executed by the interpreter.</li></ul><p><strong>The Skills We're Looking For</strong></p><p>We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:</p><ul><li>Practical and rich experience writing code in both Scala and Java, including experience with type-level programming techniques in the former (3+ years).</li><li>A deep understanding of the JVM, its execution model, and garbage collection behaviours, born of practical experience.</li><li>Experience using the JVM's profiling and debugging tools to solve problems on large-scale projects.</li><li>Practical experience building large and complex software systems.</li><li>Experience in building compilers and/or the design of type systems.</li></ul><p>It would be a big bonus if you had:</p><ul><li>Experience with GraalVM and the Truffle framework for programming language development.</li><li>Experience with dependent type systems, row types, type-checking algorithms, and type-inference.</li></ul><p><strong>About Luna</strong></p><p>Luna is an award-winning general-purpose programming language and data-science platform, selected by NASA and Singularity University as a technology with the potential to impact the lives of one-billion people worldwide. It spans the entire stack, from high-level visualisation and communication, to the nitty-gritty of running backend services in a single language. With inbuilt capabilities for visualisation and a dual-syntax architecture, the possibilities are limitless.</p><p>At Luna, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.</p><p>We welcome anybody to our team, as long as you have the desire and drive to see Luna succeed.</p><p><strong>Who You'll Work With</strong></p><p>You'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and communication, and input is always welcomed.</p><p>We firmly believe that only by working <em>together</em>, rather than putting our team members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Luna that can be.</p><p><strong>The Details</strong></p><p>As part of the Luna team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules, or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like. We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility of equity as time goes on.</p><p><strong>How To Apply?</strong></p><p>Send us an email at <code><a href='mailto:jobs@luna-lang.org' rel='nofollow'>jobs@luna-lang.org</a></code>, and tell us a little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role! You can also tell us about:</p><ul><li>Some of your past work or projects.</li><li>Why you'd like to work on Luna, and where you imagine Luna being in 5 years.</li><li>The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.</li><li>Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently with your team.</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/289017?reset=False&amp;ra=1yVuGCjMifOo&amp;oqs=a%3D1yVuGCjMifOo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team built around the Humility, Respect, and Trust ideology.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours, possible part / full time remote work.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work in a small team of world-class engineers and make impact on Luna.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive compensation + possibility of equity as time goes on.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equality, diversity &amp; inclusion.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We've got standing desks in our office (no one uses them though :P).</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Currently, our testing group is expanding. So we’re looking for someone who loves playing with (and breaking!) software, and who also enjoys computers and technology.

We’re looking for someone to work part-time (around 20 hours/week), during weekdays and daytime hours. There is the possibility of increasing hours as needs increase in the future.

If you’re the kind of person who re-reads sent emails looking for typos, discovers continuity errors in movies and has no qualms about repeatedly experimenting with a 50-ingredient chili recipe, this job may be for you.</p><p>This role will report directly to the Manager of Quality Assurance.</p><p><strong>About us</strong></p><p>TeamSnap is an award-winning communication and management service for recreational and competitive sports teams, tournaments and organizations. With over 20 million enthusiastic customers in 195 countries, TeamSnap is indispensable for teams, clubs and leagues worldwide.</p><p>We value trust, communication and fun more than big company policies and rules, and we thrive on empowering our people instead of controlling them. TeamSnap has been named to Outside Magazine’s list of Best Places to Work three consecutive years.</p><p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></p><p>As a QA Tester you will work closely with our product teams throughout the feature development cycle. Using your critical thinking skills and clear communication, your ultimate goal will be to prevent bugs and usability issues from being introduced early, enabling faster and easier testing and development later, as well as documenting concerns and inconsistencies as they arise. You must have painstaking attention to detail, patience for repetitive work and a sleuth-like capacity for uncovering non-obvious problems.</p><p>You will create test coverage outlines, bug reports and additional supporting documentation. Often you will be in uncharted waters and it will be up to you to find the rocky shoals that lie just beneath the surface. We play fast and loose with metaphors around here and we expect you to do the same.</p><p>You are not expected to have software development skills or experience with automated test tooling but would be a bonus.</p><p><strong>Some things that are important:</strong></p><ul><li>3-4 years of relevant QA experience as the primary QA tester on a project or team</li><li>Strong knowledge of the principles, practices and procedures of quality assurance testing and the ability to apply this knowledge and skills.</li><li>Possess a solid understanding of process flow and development; strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.</li><li>Strong decision-making skills, with the ability to prioritize and know where to focus.</li><li>Ability to think from a user’s perspective.</li><li>Excellent communication.</li><li>Ability to write clearly and concisely.</li><li>Attention to detail.</li><li>Keen organizational skills.</li><li>A relentless desire to investigate and explore all the nooks and crannies</li><li>A nice demeanor, but not a pushover. Sometimes you have to give developers bad news that their software broke, but in a friendly way.</li><li>Basic interest and knowledge about team sports.</li><li>A no-compromises attitude towards quality.</li><li>Ability to work as part of a geographically-distributed development team</li><li>Flexibility, teamwork, sense of humor and the willingness to do what’s necessary to help a relatively small company grow quickly</li></ul><p><strong>Other things that would be nice to have:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with Jira or similar.</li><li>Experience with Ghost Inspector or similar.</li><li>Experience in both Windows/Mac and Android/iOS.</li><li>Ability to read through all of the bullet points.</li><li>Tons of old iPhone and Android phones just lying around your house.</li><li>Be a parent, coach or participant in a recreational sport</li><li>Be a TeamSnap user (sign up for a free trial to see what we’re about)</li><li>Ability to talk to animals, Doctor Doolittle-style</li></ul><p><strong>Loctaion</strong></p><p><strong>We are headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, but this job is remote (unless you happen to live near Boulder, in which case you’re welcome to come to the office). </strong>TeamSnap is a mostly-distributed company, so you must be very comfortable working with people who aren’t in the same physical location as you or each other. While we love all parts of the world, we can only hire US-based citizens at this time.</p><p><strong>Why TeamSnap?</strong></p><ul><li>Work on a product that people use and love</li><li>While we’re still relatively small, we’re not a fly-by-night startup; we’re the leader in a massive market</li><li>We have a proven revenue model, an experienced executive team, solid funding, and a strong strategic plan</li><li>We have fantastic benefits, and you’ll have a stake in the company</li></ul><p>If you’re looking for an opportunity to show off the very best of your skills, in an environment of trust, respect and flexibility, this might very well be the best job you’ll ever have. We’re passionate about helping our customers spend less time organizing and more time playing.</p><p><strong>Benefits and Perks</strong></p><p>We offer competitive salary and benefits, lots of opportunity to develop professionally, and the ability to demonstrate what you can achieve. TeamSnap is still small enough that your actions will help drive our success. Benefits include:</p><ul><li>Competitive salary</li><li>Medical/dental/vision for you and your family</li><li>Education reimbursement up to $1,500/yr</li><li>Wellness stipend of $50/mo</li><li>401K</li><li>Free TeamSnap service for your family and friends</li><li>Free TeamSnap swag.</li><li>Flexible PTO and vacation policy</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://teamsnap.applytojob.com/apply/NjV794YcVL/Quality-Assurance-Tester' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We are currently focused on empowering young people to improve their mental health with engaging and effective digital solutions. We use an evidence-led, user-centred approach. That&rsquo;s a fancy way of saying we spend time getting to know a social issue really well and building empathy and understanding for the people we hope to reach. We&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work with the Wellcome Trust, ViiV Healthcare (GSK) and the NHS.</p><br /><p>Our previous game is <a href='https://www.championsoftheshengha.com/'>Champions of the Shengha</a>, a real-time card battling game that helps young people regulate their emotions through biofeedback, clinically proven through an RCT.</p><br /><h4><strong>About the Project</strong></h4><br /><p>Now, we are creating a game to support young people with low to medium anxiety.</p><br /><p>From our research, we know that there are an estimated 400,000 young people aged 7-12 in the UK with disordered anxiety, but 50-70% of these do not access support. Exposure therapy, the 'active ingredient' of CBT, is the most effective treatment for childhood anxiety disorders, but it is difficult for young people to access and costly for the NHS to provide. And when receiving treatment, an estimated 23-47% of young people drop off during the treatment period.</p><br /><p>At the same time, young people actively engage with games: 92% of boys and 96% of girls play games regularly, and 8-11 year olds in the UK spend on average 10 hours a week playing games.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our aim is to provide clinically effective, low-cost, accessible early support to young people aged 8-12 with low to medium anxiety by facilitating exposure therapy through our high quality, engaging and&nbsp; immersive digital game.</p><br /><h4><strong>The Roles</strong></h4><br /><p>Essential Skills &amp; Experience</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience in running test cycles on shipped iOS and Android titles.</li><br /><li>Familiarity with a range of development software.</li><br /><li>Skilled in test plan creation and following through with these test plans.</li><br /><li>Ability to work autonomously with remote development and external QA teams.</li><br /><li>Excellent written communication skills.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Desirable Skills &amp; Experience</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Familiarity with BSI British Standards for medical devices, ISO 62366 and usability standards for medical devices. Not necessary knowledge, opportunity to learn in-role.</li><br /><li>Familiarity with JIRA Cloud and Confluence for task management, bug tracking and compliance management.</li><br /><li>Analytics and backend server database testing knowledge a big plus.</li><br /><li>A range of current iOS and Android mobiles and tablets for compatibility testing.</li><br /><li>Able to travel into Manchester occasionally for testing on-site with the development team.</li><br /><li>Working with external QA teams for compatibility testing.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Please apply with a CV and covering letter.</strong></p>",

We design and conduct In-Home Usage Testing (IHUT) locally and nationally to provide actual user feedback to companies and market research firms to evaluate products, packaging, related product instructions and more. \n <br>We leverage our network of private panels (In-Home Usage Testers) to provide product testers to companies for evaluating the in-home experience with a wide variety of products to ensure proper product certification and greater market access. \n <br>Please note that although this job can be done from home 95% of the time, very occasionally In-Home Product Testers may be asked to visit the client's office, laboratory, store, warehouse or factory for training or meetings (visits are local and scheduled at no more than 20 minutes drive from the In-Home Usage Tester address). These optional visits are also paid by the hour. \n <br>During your application process, we will determine your consumer profile and establish what products would be suitable for you to test according to your demographics, lifestyle, consumer behavior, skills, hobbies and ability. Research questionnaires are used to identify and target certain types of consumers, to ensure the right participants are engaged and to achieve the representative sample needed. Job candidates for In-Home Usage Testing are also screened to meet the client s needs for the project to ensure that the product is one that they qualify to test and that they have a balance of demographics and attitudes. \n <br>Participation in these product testing and consumer panels is always free, secure and private. In-Home Usage Testing is a quick, easy and fun way to make extra cash by telling big brands what you think about their upcoming products and services in the American market.\n <br>\n <br>Main duties: \n <br>Sign and return non-disclosure agreements before the product to be tested is shipped. Individuals who complete the required documents will have the products sent to their homes.\n <br>Once the product is received for In-Home Usage Test (IHUT), the Product Tester must take care of the product being tested and use it responsibly.\n <br>Read and strictly follow the In-Home Usage Test Daily Schedule provided with each product testing project. In-Home Usage Test Daily Schedules may include tasks to do such as: unpacking, reading instructions, journal entries, online or mobile feedback, usage of product for certain amount of time, writing reviews, taking pictures, etc.\n <br>Properly document In-Home Usage Test as instructed in the In-Home Usage Test Daily Schedule. Types of documentation commonly used for In-Home Usage Tests are snapshots, audio recordings, videos and Product Journals. \n <br>Attend Skype meetings or conference call meetings with Account Managers, Brand Managers, Research Managers, Product Managers or small business owners to offer ongoing product usage feedback. These short virtual meetings may take place 2-3 times per week and are paid by the hour also.\n <br>Some In-Home Usage Tests projects may require participants to use MFour s Mobile In-Home Use Test Technology (cutting edge smartphone technology to capture Point-of-Emotion insights to gain unparalleled depth of responses).\n <br>Paid Product Testing is done from home 95% of the time, but very occasionally paid Product Testers may be asked to visit the client's office, laboratory, store, warehouse or factory for training or meetings.
