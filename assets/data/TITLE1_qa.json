We’ve raised over £20million in venture capital funding and were recently named as the second-fastest growing tech company in the UK by Deloitte.

Many current scientific instruments are controlled by 1993-era software. When compared to current technology, chromatography instruments do not store and share data well. Studies reveal scientists spending the majority of their applied time extracting, converting, and loading data as part of their workflow. This is not a research science problem, or a chromatographic problem. This requires a software technology solution.</p><p>Practichem believes scientific instrument software should be as intuitive to use as a smart phone app. We’re setting a new standard for the laboratory by creating browser based software that runs our scientific instruments. Help us drive innovation to the laboratory for greater discovery and collaboration.</p><p><strong>Who we are</strong></p><p>Practichem is a different kind of company and we like it that way.

    "content": "<p>We created Waggel because we believe technology can make pet ownership easier and more joyful for dog and cat owners.</p><br /><p>Our industry leading and fully-digital pet insurance product was launched in December 2018 and has been featured on TechCrunch amongst others. We've since experienced rapid month-on-month growth taking us to our first thousand customers within our first year of trading, resulting in plenty of 5* reviews!</p><br /><p>Over the next year we'll be focusing on our members app, the purpose of which is to enrich the lives of our predominantly London-based millennial members and their pets through an aspirational and personalised app that encourages and rewards healthy behaviours akin to Vitality.</p><br /><p>In order to improve the robustness of our insurance product and the members app, we are looking for a QA engineer who can join our product team based just down the road from Shoreditch, though remote working from anywhere in the UK is an option.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>The Role</strong></p><br /><p>You'll be championing high quality deliverables by facilitating continuous browser and device testing of new features and bugs. This will be done in two parts:</p><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Automated testing</strong> - Written in TypeScript, you&rsquo;ll be using tools such as Playwright, Node.JS, GraphQL and Jest to write automated unit, integration and end to end tests across our micro-service architecture.</li><br /><li><strong>Manual testing</strong> - Before features and bug fixes are shipped to production you&rsquo;ll be responsible for testing the functionality and design requirements. This will be for both desktop and mobile browsers and mobile apps.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>About You</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Strong work experience in JavaScript and/or Typescript.</strong> If your experience is mainly as a developer that&rsquo;s absolutely fine.</li><br /><li><strong>Quick</strong> - You&rsquo;re going to be the QA for 3 developers, so you need to be able to write code quickly and testing things manually at a fast pace, without sacrificing quality. You should thrive under pressure!</li><br /><li><strong>Enthusiastic and proactive</strong> - Bring ideas to the table, over step your boundaries and challenge those around you.</li><br /><li><strong>Confident communicator</strong> - Experience adapting communication to suit a variety of stakeholders including engineering, creative and marketing teams.</li><br /><li><strong>Comfortable with MVP and iterative development</strong> - Pragmatism is king when you're punching above your weight in a big industry so you should be comfortable with an MVP philosophy.</li><br /><li><strong>Design driven</strong> - You have an eye for design and compromise makes you sick.</li><br /><li><strong>Customer centric</strong> - You will put the customer experience first at all times.</li><br /><li><strong>Dog friendly</strong> - You love and are not allergic to dogs (we have several in the office).</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Your Responsibilities</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Determining when and where to write automated tests for different features and bug fixes. We use continuous integration so it&rsquo;s very important to know that the product is working as expected.</li><br /><li>Briefing in work to the wider product team in sprint planning sessions.</li><br /><li>Derive insight from our customer services team to better inform our understanding of our product and our members.</li><br /><li>Acting as the main point of sign off for any work going to production. You&rsquo;ll need to be able to demonstrate new features and bug fixes to any relevant stakeholders if further sign off is required.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>3-5 years work experience in a JavaScript and/or TypeScript development or automated testing role.</li><br /><li>Any experience with automated testing would be ideal.</li><br /><li>Familiar with requirements gathering and documentation techniques.</li><br /><li>Experience working in the same room as designers and engineers.</li><br /><li>Competent understanding of product testing practices.</li><br /><li>Great interpersonal skills.</li><br /><li>Team mentality - we work together, take risks together, celebrate together and stay humble together.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Your Portfolio Should</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Clearly demonstrate a passion for web development and testing.</li><br /><li>Evidence your ability to write high quality JavaScript and/or TypeScript.</li><br /><li>Show your ability at having an eye for detail and improving upon things.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience working as a JavaScript/TypesScript developer.</li><br /><li>Experience writing automated tests.</li><br /><li>Experience working in pet and/or finance.</li><br /><li>Experience performing manual testing across mobile and web based products.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Salary</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>&pound;30,000 per annum</li><br /></ul>",

We are a completely distributed company, with staff based around the globe, looking to grow our team of A-level developers. <strong>Are you ready to join us? </strong></p><p><strong>What we’re about</strong></p><p>SDVI is engaged in an exciting challenge: bringing the benefits of cloud-enabled technology to world-class Media &amp; Entertainment companies. The media industry is in the midst of a radical shift: content is streamed to individuals around the globe - in their living room, in their lap, or in the palm of their hand. SDVI is at the center of that transformation.</p><p>SDVI is the market leader in its space and, with 100% business growth year-on-year, we’re pursuing an aggressive company growth strategy. We’re partnered with global industry leaders, including Discovery, Fox, Sky, Turner, and others.

You can thrive in an Agile environment where engineers talk directly to their users and immediately see how your work is making a real difference. You appreciate commitment to best-practices – solving problems the <em>right </em>way, not just <em>any</em> way.</p><p>You want to be part of a team that respects individuals and their work. You can work independently and maintain focus. You enjoy working on enterprise-scale projects, or you are ready to take on that challenge. You consider the big picture and your contribution to it.</p><p><strong>What we’re like</strong></p><p>If we do say so ourselves, we are smart, competitive, responsible, creative and fun. We enjoy big challenges and excellence in our work. We value a supportive team culture, and we expect our staff to maintain strong work/life balance, because good people are the difference between a satisfactory job and a great job. We’ve found that the sharpest and most creative people also tend to be the most fun. A great sense of humor is highly valued around here - that’s what keeps our energy up and makes us look forward to working together each day.</p><p>And we do work closely together every day, even though we don’t share an office. As a completely distributed company, we each work in the place that makes the most sense for us, whether at home, on the road, in a shared business workspace… the possibilities are really up to you. We’ve created an infrastructure that makes the distributed work environment <em><strong>work</strong></em> for our teams.</p><ul><li>Video chat tools for easy face2face interaction</li><li>Daily, focused standups to stay on-target and connected</li><li>Technology stipends to support your productive work environment</li></ul><p>We also <strong>bring our staff together</strong> for quarterly in-person meetings that include team dinners and activities.

We optimise for impact, not headcount.\\n* We carefully consider tradeoffs in technology and processes that could lead to increased complexity.\\n* We live the TypeScript life. We strive for code quality over quantity and stick to a simple development process, spending more time creating and less time in admin.\\n* We use React Native on the frontend, sharing around 98% of the code between Android, iOS and Web. We use Typescript on the backend too!\\n* We’re believers in functional programming. We concentrate state, minimise side effects and abstract when necessary.\\n* We automate where there is a logical business case to do so..\\n* Our biggest challenge is managing the complexity of sharing code across a suite of apps.\\n* We don’t believe in hierarchy. Autonomy, ownership and passion are the secret ingredients behind Drops. Clear, honest communication is the linchpin of our culture, success and independence.\\n\\n**Benefits**\\n\\n*  All the perks of remote working\\n*  An awesomely compact 19 person team\\n*  Yearly educational allowance\\n*  Fitness allowance\\n*  High-end Apple hardware and ergonomic accessories\\n*  30 days of holiday per year (including Christmas and other holidays)\\n* ✈️ Quarterly team gathering somewhere in the world (Amsterdam, Iceland, Lisbon and Budapest were previous locations)\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n **What are we looking for?**\\n\\nWe’re looking to expand our QA team with an inquisitive, forward thinking automation engineer to support our development team across a suite of Drops apps. You’ll be responsible for automating tests in key areas of the applications. From golden path to intrinsic gameplay functionality, you’ll be looking to guarantee quality and keep regression at bay!\\n\\nYou should have a strong foundation in testing, experienced and knowledgeable in both automation and manual practices. You can prioritise workload and are skilled at finding bugs others have difficulty spotting, writing automation test scripts from a blank canvas where appropriate. \\n\\n# Requirements\\n* You can see a problem from the product, development, and user’ perspective.\\n* You have great hard skills but even better soft skills.\\n* You’re competent in contemporary JS based QA technologies and toolsets (Cypress, Cucumber/Behave feature files, AWS; S3, Lambda, RDS, Cognito).\\n* You’ve got hands on experience with CI tooling (Jenkins, BuildKite, Bitrise, etc).\\n* You’ve got experience in api, load and security testing.\\n* You’ve worked within an agile development team.\\n* You know when to manually test and when to automate.\\n* You’re Proficient in testing practices such as BDD, TDD and competent in declarative testing.\\n* You’re able to identify priorities and application hotspots for testing.\\n* You have introspective tendencies and are looking for a position where you can grow, fast. \\n\\n#Location\\n- EU-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

We believe that online merchants should have an easy-to-implement solution that offers customers an alternative to instant payment, hence giving customers a chance to evaluate the purchase before actual payment. The last 4 years, ViaBill has grown from our first office in an art gallery to multiple offices throughout the world and from a handful of customers to handling transactions worth more than $150M per year.&nbsp;</p><p>At ViaBill, we know that becoming the best at something is not easy. It takes skill, hard work, and an unmatched level of ambition. We believe in these ideals and offer a job with great potential for career development, freedom to unfold skills and competencies, and an environment that values different perspectives. Continuous improvement, learning, and growth are encouraged and even rewarded. From engineers to sales, we’re on the hunt for exceptional talent to help us scale our business and get ViaBill into the hands of millions of people.</p><p>The developer team consists of highly-motivated individuals who work remotely. We collaborate much like open source projects with core maintainers for our services. Each developer has a high level of freedom working in a flat hierarchy with a streamlined process where the domain experts are easily available.</p><p>We are constantly developing and striving to not only scale, but to improve our software solutions through automating processes and removing inefficiencies wherever possible. We value people who challenge the status quo.</p><p>We work with a very rapid release schedule - often releasing multiple times per day - giving us a quick and motivating feed-back loop. This allows us to experiment and adopt new trends/frameworks quickly. This also makes it very easy for a developer to see their effect on business!</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Remote = No commute</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work/life balance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Working with cool, modern technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Meetups</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Clean code</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Agile</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
