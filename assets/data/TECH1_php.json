To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</p><p>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</p><p>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</p><p>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4><strong>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</strong></h4><ol><li><h4><strong> Solve Interesting Problems</strong></h4></li></ol><p>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</p><p>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</p><p>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</p><p>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</p><ol start=&quot;2&quot;><li><h4><strong> Work With A Clean Codebase</strong></h4></li></ol><p>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</p><p>We don’t work like that.</p><p>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</p><p>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</p><ol start=&quot;3&quot;><li><h4><strong> Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong></h4></li></ol><p>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</p><p>We get how important growth is for developers.</p><p>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.</p><p>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</p><ol start=&quot;4&quot;><li><h4><strong> Get Expert Guidance</strong></h4></li></ol><p>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</p><p>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</p><p>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</p><p>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</p><ol start=&quot;5&quot;><li><h4><strong> Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong></h4></li></ol><p>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</p><p>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</p><p>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</p><p>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</p><ol start=&quot;6&quot;><li><h4><strong> Work From Anywhere In The World</strong></h4></li></ol><p>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!</p><p>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</p><ol start=&quot;7&quot;><li><h4><strong> Stability You Can Count On</strong></h4></li></ol><p>Most startups have huge ambitions – and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</p><p>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</p><p>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.</p><ol start=&quot;8&quot;><li><h4><strong> Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong></h4></li></ol><p>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</p><p>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</p><p>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4><strong>Here’s What We Expect From You…</strong></h4><ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’re excellent at PHP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have an excellent attention to detail</li></ul><p>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><h2><span><br></span></h2></div><div><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong> 1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We don’t work like that.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><span>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</span></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><span></span></span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</span><span></span></div><div><h2><span><br></span></h2></div><div><h2><span>Here’s What We Expect From You…</span></h2></div><ul><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’re excellent at PHP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have an excellent attention to detail</span></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span></p><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>1. Solve Interesting Problems</span></p><p><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</span></p><p><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We don’t work like that.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</span></p><p><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>4. Get Expert Guidance</span></p><p><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</span></p><p><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</span></p><p><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>7. Stability You Can Count On</span></p><p><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</span></p><p><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</span></p><h2><span>Here’s What We Expect From You…</span></h2><ul><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’re excellent at PHP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have an excellent attention to detail</span></li></ul><p><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria. Other applications will not be considered. </span></p><h2><a href='https://iphonephotographyschool.com/developer/?utm_source=authenticjobs' rel='nofollow'><span>Click Here To Apply</span></a></h2><p><span>If you delay submitting your application, someone else will be hired before you.</span></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>"

They are self-motivated, proactive, and have a strong team spirit. If you're tired of the traditional freelancing platforms, you'll be happy to hear that we’re so much more. X-Team is a community of like-minded individuals, carefully chosen to ensure that they can become part of the community of the most motivated people in the world who come together to unleash their potential. What we've created is truly special and not merely a faceless platform. X-Team is where developers go to feel truly at home together while becoming more motivated than they've ever been.</p><p><strong>How long does your vetting/interview process take?</strong></p><p>It varies depending on our immediate needs and how quickly you respond to our questions and requests. On average, it takes 1-3 weeks.</p><p>More importantly though, after a decade of interviewing developers, we've learned how important it is to respect people's time. We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p>"

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</div><div><br></div><div>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</div><div><br></div><div>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</div><div><br></div><div>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.<br></div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</h2></div><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</div><div><br></div><div>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</div><div><br></div><div>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</div><div><br></div><div>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</div><div><br></div><div>We don’t work like that.</div><div><br></div><div>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</div><div><br></div><div>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</div><div><br></div><div>We get how important growth is for developers.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</div><div><br></div><div>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</div><div><br></div><div>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</div><div><br></div><div>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</div><div><br></div><div>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</div><div><br></div><div>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</div><div><br></div><div>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</strong><br></div><div>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</div><div><br></div><div>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</div><div><br></div><div>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</div><div><br></div><div>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>Here’s What We Expect From You…</h2></div><ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’re excellent at PHP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have an excellent attention to detail</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria. Other applications will not be considered.&nbsp;<br></div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>Apply Here: https://iPhonePhotographySchool.com/developer?utm_source=WhereverJobs</h2></div><div>If you delay submitting your application, someone else will be hired before you.</div>            </div><div>Apply here: <a href='https://iPhonePhotographySchool.com/developer?utm_sourceWhereverJobs' rel='nofollow'>iPhonePhotographySchool.com/developer</a></div>"

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</div><div><br></div><div>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</div><div><br></div><div>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</div><div><br></div><div>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.<br></div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</h2></div><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</div><div><br></div><div>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</div><div><br></div><div>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</div><div><br></div><div>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</div><div><br></div><div>We don’t work like that.</div><div><br></div><div>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</div><div><br></div><div>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</div><div><br></div><div>We get how important growth is for developers.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</div><div><br></div><div>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</div><div><br></div><div>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</div><div><br></div><div>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</div><div><br></div><div>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</div><div><br></div><div>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</div><div><br></div><div>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</strong><br></div><div>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</div><div><br></div><div>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</div><div><br></div><div>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</div><div><br></div><div>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>Here’s What We Expect From You…</h2></div><ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’re excellent at PHP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have an excellent attention to detail</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</div><div><br></div><div>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</div><div><br></div><div>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</div><div><br></div><div>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.<br></div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</h2></div><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</div><div><br></div><div>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</div><div><br></div><div>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</div><div><br></div><div>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</div><div><br></div><div>We don’t work like that.</div><div><br></div><div>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</div><div><br></div><div>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</div><div><br></div><div>We get how important growth is for developers.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions?

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in.

<div><p><strong>The No-Bullshit-iest Way We Can Describe This Job In The Least Amount Of Words In A Run-On Sentence: </strong></p><p>We build a lot of different kinds of stuff for a lot of different kinds of folks (<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/work/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/work/</a>) at a shop that is big enough to bite off important, meaningful work and small enough to have fun doing it and we’re looking for an engineer who is equally at ease talking to clients, designers, producers, and developers about things like scope, resource allocation, solutions to engineering problems, creative ideas for how to build things, ways to articulate technical complexity to normal business humans...and occasionally...cut some code.</p><p><strong>Here’s What We Think You Probably Need to Be Successful At This Job: </strong></p><ul><li>Have agency experience, leading a development team spread across multiple projects and clients.</li><li>Hands on developer and leader</li><li>Are comfortable reviewing project specifications, collaborating with company leadership to develop project estimates and technical specs</li><li>Experienced in code reviews to adhere to best practices and internal standards, providing feedback and following up on remediation</li><li>You have an ear to the ground for new tech, whether it comes from hacker news or a programming subreddit, and a desire to dive in and try it out.</li><li>Experience in architecting and building bespoke custom WordPress themes using Advanced Custom Fields, Gravity Forms, Yoast with custom integrations to third party systems.</li><li>Experience in client and server-side debugging, performance profiling and optimization techniques with an uncanny intuition for finding the cause and solution</li><li>Experience with integration of analytics, a/b testing, and advertising platforms using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Planning out projects in coordination with Project Manager/Producer and Developer team members, participating in project check-ins providing feedback to the team</li><li>Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals</li><li>Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA</li><li>Comfortable working with small projects (1 dev) and medium projects (2-3 devs)</li><li>Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation</li><li>Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI</li><li>Comfortable in architecting and implementation of APIs in PHP/Laravel, NodeJS/Express and other similar stacks.</li><li>Attention to detail and a seamless user experience. &nbsp;This means making the product look like the design and working with your team to make it smooth and perfect.</li><li>You have real-world experience with React. &nbsp;AngularJS knowledge might be transferable, but React is what we're looking for.</li><li>jQuery is &quot;nice to have&quot; but NOT necessary in your arsenal. &nbsp;You respect the finer points of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear.

Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We don’t work like that.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code.

Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span><span></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team.

Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance.

Work From Anywhere In The World</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms.

Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue.

Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life.
