Our team is 100% remote, with 32 people distributed all over the world. Our most popular products are:</p><ul><li>Jilt an email marketing platform built for eCommerce that helps stores engage and delight their customers with emails that drives sales.</li><li>WooCommerce Memberships a fullfeatured membership site solution for stores running WooCommerce.</li></ul><p>We’re looking for a full stack WordPress engineer to join our team and lead development on our websites, both internal and publicfacing, which collectively receive thousands of visits per day.</p><p><strong>The Role</strong></p><p>You’ll work closely with your teammates on the engineering, marketing, and product teams to iterate on our websites, all built on WordPress. You’ll focus on projects to enhance performance, stability, conversion optimization (through A/B testing), and security.</p><p>While the majority of your time will be spent on new features and improvements, you’ll also work on refactors to reduce technical debt and internal projects to improve the development &amp; deployment process.</p><p>As the first engineering team member focused on our websites, you’ll have a significant amount of ownership over projects. You’ll help design best practices, decide on libraries &amp; tooling, and champion technical solutions to site challenges. The right person for this role is someone who is excited to tackle both new projects as well as contribute to existing ones, and wants to contribute to multiple areas of the company.</p><p>You’ll join an existing team of engineers and marketers, but will manage several projects independently. You’ll be responsible for taking ideas from inception to execution, and keeping our team and users informed. You’ll also be responsible for moving your projects forward, communicating milestones with others, and clearly documenting your work. As a remotefirst, 100% distributed team, great communication and internal documentation are a key part of our success.</p><p><strong>Here are some things you may do on a given day:</strong></p><ul><li>Refactor a custom plugin that collects and records analytics data</li><li>Work with our design team to implement a new design for a landing page</li><li>Research and write a pitch to implement continuous integration/deployment for the website</li><li>Construct a migration to move from a WordPress multisite network to a single site</li><li>Refactor a frontend component to make it reusable across multiple areas of a site</li><li>Collaborate with freelancers and agencies on design and development</li><li>Triage the Sentry queue for exceptions that need investigation and resolution</li><li>Deploy a new A/B test to improve signup conversions</li><li>Analyze a slow area of our website and identify ways to substantially improve the performance</li><li>Design automated tests to catch regressions to key conversion funnels on the website</li></ul><p><strong>On the first day you will:</strong></p><ul><li>Meet your team and get familiar with how we work</li><li>Setup your local environment and tooling</li><li>Commit a small tweak to the Jilt.com codebase and ship it to production</li></ul><p><strong>In the first week you will:</strong></p><ul><li>Develop, QA, review, and ship a small improvement</li><li>Participate in code review for a teammate’s code</li><li>Help a team member with fixing a bug</li></ul><p><strong>In the first month you will:</strong></p><ul><li>Work closely with your teammates on the engineering and marketing teams to ship a large improvement to Jilt.com</li><li>Publish a retrospective on your first large project to share successes &amp; planned improvements for the next project</li></ul><p><strong>Who you’ll work with:</strong></p><ul><li>Justin Stern, CTO You’ll work with Justin to learn how our engineering team works together, and understand how various systems operate.</li><li>Max Rice, CEO Max leads our marketing team and you’ll work closely with him to architect and implement solutions.</li><li>Josh Catone, Head of Content You’ll work with Josh to help leverage content throughout our marketing.</li></ul><p>You’ll also work with the rest of the product (Jules, Beka, Lindsey) &amp; engineering (Chase, Jared, Fulvio, Deiva, Will, Lucas, Jonathan, Wes, Artan, Jackie, Alex) teams to review one another’s work and collaborate on projects.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>To succeed in this position, you should have:</strong></p><ul><li>Deep experience with WordPress, especially with custom themes and plugins</li><li>Experience with JavaScript, and familiar with frontend frameworks like React</li><li>Experience creating delightful user experiences with semantic HTML/CSS</li></ul><p>You love writing code that’s clear, selfdocumenting (but you know that selfdocumenting&nbsp;<em>doesn’t</em>&nbsp;mean zero comments), and standardscompliant. You’re most comfortable working in the frontend, but as a fullstack developer, you enjoy working on the backend needed.</p><p>You value building wellarchitected sites that are responsive and accessible. You enjoy keeping uptodate with the latest best practices and tools, and are constantly tweaking and improving the way you work. You know how to operate a hydraulic press, or at least watched a YouTube video about them and think they’re totally rad.</p><p>You’re excited to solve engineering challenges in the most pragmatic way possible, and most importantly, you keep the end user in mind and love getting feedback from customers and teammates to help improve our products and tooling.</p><p>Finally, you can’t wait to join a growing team that loves their work as much as you do, affords the opportunity to work on challenging &amp; interesting projects, continuously learn and improve, and constantly ship your work. You’re a great writer and can communicate effectively whether drafting up a bug report, chatting in Slack, editing a wiki page, or creating a retrospective. You know that code is about communication and explaining your thought process clearly goes handinhand. You can communicate fluently in English, or at least as close as anyone can come to fluent English, because really, it’s English.</p><p>Our team is fullyremote and we communicate primarily through Slack, Clubhouse, Google Docs, Basecamp, and a few short meetings via Zoom — we believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time that’s free of distractions.</p><p>As a remote team, we believe that regular meetups are invaluable for getting to know each other better, so you should be available for 12 companypaid team trips per year. Curious about what those are like? Check out our recap of our last team retreat (SkyTrip), which brought the entire team to a Scottish estate for a week. It’s a plus if you think (like we do) that bears are absolutely the coolest animals in the forest. Want to know more? Read what the team has to say about working with us.</p><p>This is a fulltime, salaried position, but the hours are flexible. We know your work will speak for itself with pull requests, code reviews, and wiki edits.</p><p><strong>PROCESS</strong></p><p>After an initial screening, you’ll get an email with a few questions to answer. Following that, you’ll have an initial 30 minute interview. Successful candidates will be invited to complete a short project to help you get a sense of the type of things you’d work on in the position, and help us learn more about how you think. Finally, we’ll schedule a few followup interviews with our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have. We’ll select the most qualified candidate to be offered a fulltime position, and then the real fun begins!</p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p>Here are some benefits we’re happy to offer to our team members:</p><p>Competitive salary</p><ul><li>27 days of paid timeoff, in addition to 2 company holidays (SkyVerge Day in March, Founders Day in June )</li><li>Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance for US and Canadian residents and their families (reimbursements for comparable care for nonUS/Canadian residents)</li><li>401k/RRSP Retirement plan with 4% company match for US/Canadian residents (contributions to comparable plans for nonUS/Canadian residents)</li><li>8 weeks paid parental leave for new mothers and fathers</li><li>Work flexible hours from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection</li><li>Tools (hardware/software) to help you be productive</li><li>Allowance for professional growth (books, courses, conferences)</li><li>Home office or coworking allowance</li><li>A Kindle to help you keep learning</li></ul><p><em>We support workplace diversity and do not discriminate on any protected class. We believe when we work together as a team of different views, experiences, and ideas, we can build amazing things.</em></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://apply.workable.com/skyverge/j/8361728B4D/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Do you have a passion for enabling small businesses to work to the best of their potential? Does the prospect of a pivotal role in a dynamic, young company excite you?</p><br /><h2>About us</h2><br /><p>We are a leading education provider who specialises in character education courses for children in the UK and Internationally (Saudi Arabia, Singapore, China, Mexico, Switzerland to name just a few). We are just closing a round of angel funding and now need someone to help grow the technology that drives our business and realise our ambition to become the market leader in the character education space.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;ve also recently been lucky enough to be judged as one of the top 100 best companies to escape to in 2019.</p><br /><h2>Why we exist</h2><br /><p>We want to inspire a generation of children to become the very best they can be through their relationships, their well-being and their own sense of purpose.</p><br /><p>We want to do this by teaching at least a million children over the next few years in how to communicate well, collaborate effectively, think critically, solve problems creatively and lead brilliantly so that they can shape their future and those around them.</p><br /><h2>The Role</h2><br /><p>This opportunity will suit someone who has a few years of technical experience, although we are much more interested in you, your raw talent and problem-solving skills, than in CV points.</p><br /><p>Our business is human-centred and began with providing specialised child-care and grew to providing face-to-face Life Skills courses. With growth, especially international growth, technology has grown to be a key supporting pillar to what we do. We have invested heavily in our Podio CRM over the past year and will be rebuilding our Wordpress-based web site this quarter. It will be fully integrated with Podio and some of the marketing systems we use to reach customers.</p><br /><p>Our aim is to increase Life Skills Course bookings across the world by 200%+ over the next year and that means we will be investing heavily in digital-marketing and technology. You will report to our CTO and work closely with our operational and digital-marketing teams as well as outside agencies. We have recently raised a round of angel funding to support that growth.</p><br /><p>We have begun to provide online courses and we expect much of our growth to be supported or even driven by technology. It is important that we build-up technology knowledge and skills that stay with our business. That means that this role, although contractor to start with, must be medium or long-term. We want you to stay with and grow with the business, ensuring that code is well-commented and systems well-documented. With the right skills and performance, you could grow to be a project manager, even tech manager within the growing business.</p><br /><p>You should be passionate about driving growth, working towards big goals and being a pivotal part of a fast-moving team.</p><br /><h2>Reporting to the CTO, you will:</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Build and support our website, CRM and related systems</li><br /><li>Write code that is clean, organised and well-commented</li><br /><li>Work to the tech priorities agreed with the CTO and business team</li><br /><li>Fix bugs and help the team with the systems they use</li><br /><li>On occasions, liaise and work with outside agencies</li><br /><li>Support the growth of our digital-marketing efforts</li><br /><li>Ensure that our systems are resilient, secure and always available</li><br /><li>More rarely, you will be on call late or out-of-hours if systems require</li><br /><li>Be part of a strong hard-working environment; we have quarterly team events and a great internal vibe</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Technical Skills</h2><br /><p>We are not hung up on a laundry list of required technical experience. We&rsquo;re much more interested in raw talent, intelligence and hunger but some things that would be useful are listed below. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with them now, then we would expect you to become increasingly expert with them over the next few months. You should have the motivation, brains and learning skills to do so:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>PHP - Good or some experience &ndash; PHP 7</li><br /><li>Understanding of MariaDB / MySQL, backups and basic SQL</li><br /><li>Interest and experience working with HTML5 and CSS3</li><br /><li>Some experience with Javascript, JSON and REST</li><br /><li>Interest in UX and UI design</li><br /><li>Knowledge of WordPress and WooCommerce would be ideal</li><br /><li>Some knowledge of CRM systems, ideal - Podio CRM</li><br /><li>Some Bootstrap, Adobe Creative Suite</li><br /><li>Git, version control and some project management</li><br /><li>Basic Linux system admin, Bash, scripting, Vim, Centos / Red Hat</li><br /><li>Bug-tracking and basic project-management</li><br /><li>Some knowledge of network protocols, DNS, CDN, SSL</li><br /><li>Some knowledge of payment systems &ndash; Stripe</li><br /><li>Some interest in SEO and digital marketing</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Traits we&rsquo;re looking for</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>The ability to problem-solve, research and generate ideas and solutions</li><br /><li>Energy and people skills</li><br /><li>Raw intelligence and intellectual curiosity</li><br /><li>Technical aptitude and interest in technical developments</li><br /><li>Interest in good design, presentation, photography and video</li><br /><li>The ability to work with non-technical colleagues, communicate and prioritise</li><br /><li>Independent and entrepreneurial working style &ndash; asking for help when needed</li><br /><li>Fearless pursuit of testing, analysing and learning</li><br /><li>A fun and friendly team player</li><br /><li>Happy to get your hands dirty supporting the business wherever needed including battling with the printer or helping customers</li><br /><li>Passionate about character education</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>The nitty gritty</h2><br /><p>We are looking for someone who can ideally start in&nbsp;<strong>December 2019</strong>, or before<strong>. </strong>We expect you to work from our offices on Stormont Road, Battersea, SW11 5EN as required although much of the actual tech can be done remotely. We work from home on a Wednesday and expect you to have the self-discipline and work-ethic to do the same.</p><br /><p>Your fees will be approximately&nbsp;<strong>&pound;250-350 per day, </strong>depending on experience.</p><br /><p>As a contractor, your holiday, benefits and tax are yours to take care of but there may be the opportunity to grow into a permanent role.</p><br /><p>Role Models is only 5 years-old so the team is relatively small but well-formed and great fun!&nbsp; We have 6 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees.&nbsp; As a result, you would have the opportunity to make a huge difference to the trajectory of this growing business and would be given significant responsibility.</p><br /><p>We have a relaxed dress code although we would expect that you would be able to dress more smartly when meeting customers or suppliers.</p><br /><p>To explore this exciting opportunity please send a covering letter and CV by <strong>Friday 15<sup>th</sup> November 2019</strong> or before.</p>",

You'll be working on eCommerce platforms and CMSes like Magento, Shopify and WordPress. The core technologies you'll be working with are PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS.\\n\\nOur projects are generally focused around making large, material changes to our clients' sites or designing and developing new sites from the ground up. You work closely with client stakeholders, our project managers, and other developers to design, develop and deploy features and updates that *best serve our clients and their customers*.\\n\\nWe have quite a bit of work booked for the next few months, so an ideal applicant will be ready to hit the ground running. Despite the amount of work we have, I strive to minimize context switching—if you're on a project, you shouldn't expect to be bombarded with unrelated tweaks on other projects here and there.\\n\\nWe're a small but quickly growing agency. As one of the early hires, there is opportunity for this to be a high impact position.

Together, we craft solutions that work for our clients and their customers.\\n\\n## Some Notes on Culture\\n\\nHere are some of our values. They're always being refined based on what works and what doesn't.\\n\\n* We value clear, concise communication.\\n* You can only produce high quality work if you have a clear understanding of the problem.\\n* Context—understanding our clients and their customers—empowers individual contributors to find better solutions.\\n* Free up time for interesting problems by automating repeatable tasks and learning your tools inside and out.\\n* No process for process' sake. No meetings for meetings' sake. But there *is* a place for both.\\n* Build or use tools to provide predictability and eliminate boring work.\\n* Individual productivity is important to us, and it is hugely dependent on a minimally distracting, supportive environment.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n When you start, this is what you can expect to work on.\\n\\n* Full Magento, Shopify, or WooCommerce site development\\n* Design architecture, then implement features for existing eCommerce stores\\n* Implement designs in CSS/HTML/JS\\n* Configure middleware services like Redis, Memcached, Varnish, Solr, ElasticSearch, etc.\\n* Integrate with 3rd party APIs \\n\\n# Requirements\\n## Qualifications\\n\\nThese are the must haves.

You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world and provide skills that will enhance our business intelligence system to help us make better decisions.\\n\\nWe’ll teach you the ins and outs of the online business brokerage industry, coming from years of experience. You’ll work on improving the customer journey, which should be flawless, pain free and easy to navigate. For many of our customers it is the first time either buying or selling an online business, which can be an incredibly anxious and confusing moment in their lives. You’ll be helping them directly by providing them with an easy to use interface that just makes sense.\\nThe Senior Full Stack Engineer position is vital to the success of our company, partnering with all departments to align technology strategy with the company’s objectives.\\n\\nOur small and close knit engineering team currently consists of a UX specialist, 2 frontend engineers, one backend engineer, one WordPress engineer and several QA specialists. You’ll work closely with the team to implement solutions for all departments within Empire Flippers, be it compliance, customer support, sales and migrations. Additional responsibilities could lead to supervising our engineering team.\\n\\nThis is a full time position – our company is growing at a fast rate, which means excellent opportunities for personal and career growth. We may ask you to attend conferences too, which can help you network with industry leaders.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n You’ll take on the challenge of improving the overall efficiency of Empire Flippers by developing fully fledged platforms, ensuring both the user experience and functionality are elevated to unprecedented levels. You’ll be responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment building high quality, architecturally sound systems. You will use your initiative to design and implement client-side and server-side architecture, as well as implement API’s and integrations that address our business needs. Both our clients and staff will be using the software you write and you’ll be responsible for monitoring system performance and configuring new software and hardware. \\n\\n# Requirements\\nYou must have a passion for travel, ideally with long periods of digital nomad experience with travel outside your home country.\\n\\nYou should have at least 5 good years of full stack experience under your belt, having implemented some complex, data driven applications. Your portfolio speaks louder than your words.\\n\\nYou should have team-lead or management experience with a remote team.\\n\\nAn in-depth understanding of database management systems, both relational and non-relational databases.\\n\\nHands on experience in IT, computer systems engineering, or systems engineering and analysis is necessary.\\n\\nYou should have an ability to conduct technological analyses and research, with a solid understanding of technological trends to build strategy.\\n\\nYou should be a ninja with every component of our tech stack. You must have a complete working knowledge of Ruby on Rails, SQL, Postgres, Sidekiq, Rspec, Git, Redis.\\n\\nExperience working with a wide range of 3rd party integrations. Our platform talks to many 3rd party applications, you should have experience building and maintaining such integrations in a test driven fashion.\\n\\nDev-ops/sysadmin skills, particularly AWS. Experience with managing servers, maintaining hosting environments, being responsible for uptime and responsiveness, addressing bottlenecks, ensuring backups are kept safe and sound.\\n\\nYou need to have immaculate attention to detail. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if something doesn’t quite look or feel right, to the nearest code change and to the nearest hexadecimal color, to the point you become annoying to us. At times other developers may edit your code, you’ll be watching to ensure the code base remains readable, scalable and fast.\\n\\nBe a good communicator. It sounds very cliché, but you’ll immerse yourself in almost every department, you’ll be learning problems and presenting solutions, and also overseeing the implementation of those solutions too.\\n\\nA self-starter. We need to see some evidence that you’re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you’ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won’t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day to day basis, you’ll be working in almost full autonomy, we’ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. We don’t believe in micro-management.\\n\\nA complete working knowledge in React. Our client code is written in React. Being able to navigate the front-end code and patch things up is needed.\\n\\nThe following skills/experience would be a bonus, but not required:\\n\\nPHP/WordPress. We will be interfacing with WordPress significantly, being able to speak the same language would be great.\\n\\nDatabases. A comprehensive experience working with various types of SQL and noSQL databases would be very useful. MySQL, Postgres, DynamoDB, Cassandra, to name a few.\\n\\nCaching. The software we’re building needs to be fast and to remain fast as we scale, both in terms of traffic and database size. Having experience with Memcached, Varnish or experience with complicated CDN setups with many rules would be a plus. \\n\\n#Salary\\n$120,000\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

Diversity drives our vibe. We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>About The Role</strong></strong></p><p>You will be responsible for technical design and work in the Billing area of Elastic’s Cloud product.

You will lead by example and should participate in coding, debugging complex failure scenarios, and triaging bugs. You’ll analyze the current system, participate in roadmap and project planning efforts, and will have ownership for delivering it.

Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is very transparent in our organization. We feel that anyone needs to be in a position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong><strong>Some of the things you'll work on</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Provide technical leadership for the Billing area of Cloud.

Examples include helping Support with difficult cases or consulting with the Sales Operations and IT teams to improve our end to end billing and reporting flow.</li><li>Be hands-on with the codebase. Review work done by the team, and provide constructive feedback.</li><li>Help the team define coding practices and standards.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>What you will bring along&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Proven experience as a software engineer, with a track record of delivering high-quality code.</li><li>Experience with Python as a programming language.</li><li>Comfortable working and communicating with teams from several functions – finance, data analytics, IT, etc.</li><li>Previous experience working with a SaaS platform or product.</li><li>Previous experience providing technical leadership for a team of software engineers.</li><li>Previous experience in an ownership role for roadmap curation and execution.</li><li>Experience gathering or analyzing usage data from hosting providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) is a huge plus.</li><li>Experience working on a SaaS subscription billing platform such as Stripe, Zoura, Recurly is a huge plus.</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><ul><li>Deeply competitive pay and benefits</li><li>Equity compensation</li><li>Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices</li><li>An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life</li><li>Passionate people building phenomenal products</li></ul><p>Elastic is an Equal Employment employer committed to the principles of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action for all applicants and employees.

We're looking for an amazing developer who is well versed in either the Magento or Drupal platform (both would be amazing). You will have the opportunity to work with leading companies and marketing teams to develop complex sites and integrations between systems.</p><p>We are a fully distributed team that primarily builds in PHP on the Magento and Drupal platforms for ecommerce and content management sites. Since we are fully remote, you can work from anywhere! We do require at least 4 hours of working time overlap with the Pacific time zone work day where most of our clients are located. As a highly client focused organization, you will occasionally need to meet according to their schedule. This typically falls between 10 and 5 Pacific time, and we strive to give you plenty of time to focus on development.</p><p>Working with a variety of clients, we fluidly form groups including a Technical Project Manager, a Quality Analyst, and one or more developers to complete sprints of work. The type of work depends on the client, but often includes:</p><ul><li>Developing custom modules and extensions for Drupal CMS and Magento Commerce.</li><li>Integration with various APIs and third-party systems.</li><li>Migrating existing sites to modern platforms.</li><li>Knowledgeable with front-end development: HTML/CSS/Javascript coding, with Twig and PHP at the template level</li></ul><p>With Bear Group, you will tackle technical problems, code and debug primarily PHP/javascript/css, and occasionally participate in client meetings. You will need to be self-motivating and able to work independently most of the time, but we have a friendly and capable team to collaborate with when you encounter obstacles. Since the technology world is constantly evolving, you’ll be expected to keep up with the current technologies and practices. To help with this, we provide an annual education stipend that can be used for attending relevant conferences or continued education courses.</p><p>During your first week you will work closely with one of our senior developers to set up your new system and familiarize with our processes and tools. The system will be either Mac, Linux, or Windows to your preference, and we use Vagrant to manage virtual machines for a consistent development server stack. Other tools you will use include:</p><ul><li>Git for source control</li><li>Bitbucket for Git repositories</li><li>Jira for project management</li><li>Confluence for documentation</li><li>Slack for communication.</li></ul><p>As you get your feet under you we will introduce some project work, again in collaboration with a senior developer on a sprint they are currently working on. Ultimately our developers work independently on your own tickets and sprints.</p><p>In addition to competitive pay, a new computer, insurance, and 401k match, you’ll also receive:</p><ul><li>3 Weeks PTO plus approximately 10 vacation days annually</li><li>$1500 annual education stipend</li><li>Software stipend for the tools that you prefer to do the job</li></ul><p><br>To learn more about the company, visit&nbsp;<a href='http://www.beargroup.com/' rel='nofollow'>www.beargroup.com</a>.
