This is a remote, full-time position.</p><p>CLIENT COMPANY DESCRIPTION:<br>The client company is a membership organisation which provides country sports insurance and other benefits to members in the UK and Ireland. The company and its first club were established in 2008 and sister club was launched in 2017. They are looking to streamline the purchase process and improve overall user experience to encourage new members and maintain existing members. They also want to improve their search rankings by ensuring the new site is optimised to help potential customers find them, and relevant information about their products, quickly and easily.<br><br>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:<br>You will be tasked with developing two new websites from scratch (and potentially maintain them in the future)<br><br>Both websites are for clubs which require a membership database, members area with login, e-commerce and an admin control panel to manage memberships / purchases etc. There are various referral forms and a member’s benefits page which needs to have an interface for Trade Associates to upload details of special offers to members - this needs an approval system. There are lots more unique elements which require additional features for specific types of memberships/sales and, although functionality is broadly similar across the two sites, the second club also requires some extra functionality not required in the first.<br><br>Features they do not currently have and would like to introduce include optional recurring / automated renewal and payments, means to purchase multiple memberships in a single transaction, claims forms and claims management in the admin panel, ability to attach uploaded files to a member's record, ability to create custom reports and many more minor tweaks.<br><br>The current websites have been built (and built upon) by their in-house web developer. As the company has grown, requirements and systems have changed and the existing database and code is no longer fit for their purpose. They require a full structural review of the database and rebuilding from the ground up to ensure everything is fully cohesive. Existing membership data will need to be migrated into the new database and systems.<br><br>Once the new sites are finished and launched the client will require ongoing maintenance and updates.<br><br>RELATIONSHIPS - WHO YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH:<br>You will be reporting to the Managing Director and consulting with existing in house developer (and potentially another freelance developer) as needed. The client is in the Europe/London (+00:00) GMT time zone.<br><br>REQUIRED SKILLS:<br>- Strong English Communication<br>- PHP (Laravel or Symfony experience strongly preferred)<br>- JavaScript<br>- HTML<br>- CSS<br>- MySQL<br>- Server Configuration and Management in AWS<br>- Git<br><br>DESIRED (NICE-TO-HAVE) SKILLS:<br>- Experience with a modern JavaScript framework like React, Angular or Vue)<br>- Payment Gateway Integration experience<br><br>START DATE:<br>March 16, 2020<br><br>EXPECTED CONTRACT DURATION:<br>About 6 months but this is flexible. Ongoing maintenance thereafter.<br><br>NOTES:<br>The client is open to someone who can start part-time, but with a transition to full-time.</p><p>HOURLY RATE:</p><p>The pay rate for this role is from $30 to $50 USD per hour, depending on experience and capability.</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

You’re proactive in tackling things that need to be done <strong>without direction</strong>.&nbsp;</div><div><br>You’re exceptional at communicating in writing via instant message, email, etc. You’re ok on the phone and video chat too. You understand that <strong>clear, concise written communication</strong> is how remote teams thrive. Putting a pull request up for review without explaining its context is unheard of for you.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>You own both successes and failures</strong>. When a project you’re leading turns into a disaster, you own it and you learn from it. You never point the finger at others.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>You invite criticism</strong> and genuinely want to grow as a professional. You’re onboard with <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/team-pushes-better-developers/' rel='nofollow'>pushing each other to be better</a> and are not afraid to give constructive criticism in addition to receiving it.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Perks</strong>&nbsp;</div><ul><li><strong>Location Independent.</strong> Work from wherever you’re happiest, as long as you can make scheduled meetings.</li><li><strong>Choose Your Schedule.</strong> Most companies claim to have flexible hours, but the reality is often very different. We flex our hours for real. As long you’re hitting 30-37.5 hours per week on average and you do what you say you’ll do, we’re good.</li><li><strong>Company Retreats.</strong> As a remote company, it’s super important to get some face time. Last year we met up in <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/berlin-fifth-annual-retreat/' rel='nofollow'>Berlin</a> and we’re headed to Portugal in June. Will you be joining us?</li><li><strong>Personal Development.</strong> If there’s a conference or event that will help you level up, the company will cover your expenses. You’re also allotted 3 hours per month to learn something new, participate in community discussions, and/or contribute to an open source project.</li><li><strong>Profit Sharing.</strong> I present a Profit &amp; Loss report to the team quarterly so everyone knows how the company is doing. And when the company does well, the team does well.</li><li><strong>Company Holidays.</strong> Things get pretty quiet in late December / early January, so we always treat ourselves to a couple of weeks off to reboot during this time.</li><li><strong>Paid Leave.</strong> For the birth or adoption of a child, the company offers 8 weeks of 100% paid leave for primary caregivers and 3 weeks for secondary caregivers. We also offer 5 paid sick days and 3 days of paid bereavement leave.</li><li><strong>Competitive Salaries.</strong> The company pays salaries that are competitive with the market in which you reside. We don’t use the benefits of remote as leverage to negotiate lower salaries.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Apply</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Fill out the application form: <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/laravel-developer-apply' rel='nofollow'>https://deliciousbrains.com/laravel-developer-apply</a>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer.

In doing so we're aiming to become Europe&rsquo;s most loved flower brand. We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;20million in venture capital funding and were recently named as the second-fastest growing tech company in the UK by Deloitte. One of the Tech Nation &ldquo;Future Fifty&rdquo; alumni and one of the Sunday Times Top 100 Small Companies to Work For 2020, we&rsquo;re now the fastest growing online flower company in Europe.</p><br /><p>Our business has, so far, been in the fortunate position to be able to continue trading and growing during this time of economic uncertainty, with the Government actively encouraging online retail, and customer demand for flowers for their loved ones is strong due to social distancing measures in place.</p><br /><p>This is a great opportunity for a Software Engineering Manager with people management experience to lead two cross functional engineering squads.

Working with our VP Engineering and Technology Leadership team, you&rsquo;ll help to solve our top priority problems for the quarter from a technology and people perspective.</p><br /><p>As an experienced people manager you&rsquo;ll take responsibility for performance management, career progression, pastoral care and everything else that means that you have a happy and motivated squad.

You&rsquo;ll be a great coach and servant leader, able to motivate and guide the squad through the good times and the bad, learning and improving as you go.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We care about creating a diverse and inclusive team - it's what helps us generate the best ideas and grow faster.

    "content": "Attention Senior Backend Developers:“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”You’ve finally found it…The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!But only if you keep reading.iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School1 - Solve Interesting ProblemsMost of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.2 - Work With A Clean CodebaseTell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”We don’t work like that.We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.3 - Endless Opportunities To GrowYou love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.We get how important growth is for developers.Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.4 - Get Expert GuidanceOur developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own TimeHave you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.6 - Work From Anywhere In The WorldWe understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.7 - Stability You Can Count OnMost startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your CodeHelping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.Here’s What We Expect From You…- You’re excellent at PHP - You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP - You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years - You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems - You want to participate in scrum teamwork - You have an excellent attention to detail Please only apply if you meet all these criteria. Other applications will not be considered.

Due to automatization of disinformation search, the platform not only saves 3-4 hours per day per journalist, but also solves one of the largest issues in countering disinformation - which is timely reaction: in case a large, potentially harmful campaign is detected, the system automatically notifies journalists to debunk it before the story went viral and the consequences became irreversible. Since the inception of Debunk EU, the journalists have debunked over 200 disinformation campaigns detected by the platform which were read more than 13 million times.</p><p>Debunk.eu was invited to present its work in17 countries in over 70 events&nbsp;including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Austria, Belgium, France, Georgia, Italy, The Netherlands, Serbia, Slovakia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, North Macedonia and The United States.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Challenging and groundbreaking projects that disrupt the market</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>No strict hierarchy - we are always glad to hear your insights</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>No stress for mistakes - lear through experiments and brainstorming</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Growth with us</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>A great team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>International traveling, events, media</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
