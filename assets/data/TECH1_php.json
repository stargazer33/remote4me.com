    "content": "<h3>Senior Backend Software Engineer</h3><div><p>To support this growth, we’re looking for an experienced and hugely talented Senior Software Engineer to help us take our technology platform to the next level. As a Senior Software Engineer at Gousto, you’ll be working closely with other senior members of the Engineering team to help shape our architecture, our engineering processes and help to build a massively talented engineering team.</p><p>Our ideal candidate will have demonstrated an ability to apply their broad and deep technical skills within a commercial setting and will always be striving to solve real business problems using the most elegant technical solutions. We want someone with proven technical leadership skills and a solid understanding of what it takes to design and deliver scalable, distributed, cloud based systems in a highly available manner.</p><p>Most of all you’ll be passionate about making Gousto a success.</p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p><strong>Key Responsibilities</strong></p><p><strong>Leading our migration to a Microservices architecture –&nbsp;</strong>We’re building a broad and comprehensive platform that will power a modern and complex e-commerce business. We understand that building everything from a CRM, order processing capabilities and courier integrations into a single codebase is a bad idea. We’re committed to a Microservices architecture and passionate about delivering it properly. For example, we’ve been busy building out an asynchronous messaging bus on AWS using SNS and SQS to reduce chained API calls between services, increase performance and reduce the brittleness of our systems.</p><p>We’re looking for someone that can help us continue this journey.</p><p><strong>Continuing to evolve our Agile development process –&nbsp;</strong>We use Scrum, we like it and we believe it aligns with Gousto’s delivery led culture. However, we also understand that our processes aren’t perfect and need to evolve as we grow. We’re looking for someone who’s seen Agile delivered in complex engineering environments across multiple teams.</p><p><strong>Help to “Raise the Bar” –&nbsp;</strong>We believe that one of the most important things our senior engineers do is educate the more junior members of the team. We’re looking for an Engineer that can bring new and innovative engineering practices into the team, someone who is willing to help educate and help to improve what we do on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Obsessing over quality &amp; performance –&nbsp;</strong>As one of our most senior engineers you should obsess over the quality of what the team delivers. Whether that be the quality and maintainability of our code or making sure we identify and squash every bug out there. We’re also an e-commerce business, we understand that every millisecond counts when it comes to page speed and we want you to help us make our site fly!</p><p><strong>Building a world class engineering team –&nbsp;</strong>We are just at the beginning of our journey and will be looking to significantly invest in engineering talent going forwards. Helping to build a truly great team of engineers will be a hugely important part of what you do.</p><p><strong>Key capabilities</strong></p><ul><li>Broad and deep engineering skills across a number of different languages, we’re primarily developing on PHP, using both the Laravel and Lumen frameworks so experience in these is hugely advantageous.</li><li>A proven track record leading technology teams in complex engineering environments. Ideally you’ll have had delivery responsibility across multiple teams.</li><li>Experience in architecting distributed systems on a public cloud platform. Ideally you’ll have experience designing a Microservices platform on AWS (even better if you did it without servers!).</li><li>Worked within a Devops organisation. At Gousto our developers are responsible for the operational health of the services they develop. We believe this fosters a great culture and are looking for someone who knows how to handle those rare but critical production issues.</li><li>Excellent communication and presentation skills, whether to the engineering team, to business stakeholders or to our leadership team.</li></ul><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><ul><li>Working with a passionate team who love to learn and implement new technologies</li><li>22 days of holiday (plus bank holidays) increasing by a day each year up to 25</li><li>Option to buy up to 5 additional days of annual leave</li><li>Coffee, tea, ice cream, cereal and fruit provided every single day to keep you fresh</li><li>Wine, beer and soft-drinks provided every Friday evening</li><li>As many new recipes to test cook as you can handle</li><li>40% staff discount on Gousto boxes and 25% for your family and friends</li><li>Free gym membership after 6 months</li><li>Childcare vouchers</li><li>Company pension</li><li>Cycle to work scheme</li><li>Regular all-company socials</li><li>Quarterly team socials</li><li>&quot;tech 10%&quot; - use every other Friday to sharpen your own skills and work on your own projects</li></ul><p><strong>Equal opportunity</strong></p><p>We are dedicated to equal opportunities in all areas of Gousto. We employ over 20 nationalities and believe it’s fundamental to represent all genders in all functions and levels. All individuals will be treated in a fair and equal manner and in accordance with the law regardless of age, disability, gender, pregnancy and maternity, marital status, race, religion or sexual orientation.

There is also the opportunity to contribute to the design and UX process on a number of fronts and the ideal candidate will help us to achieve the best user experience solutions for our clients.</p><h2><strong>The ideal candidate will have:</strong></h2><p>– Excellent HTML and CSS skills including working knowledge of LESS or SASS, Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation and other frameworks etc<br> – Excellent experience with Drupal themeing (both Drupal 7 and 8 experience a positive)<br> – Git experience<br> – Confidence in a PHP based environment</p><p>As part a small (but growing) team of 30 you’ll have instant responsibility and an opportunity to learn new skills and explore new technologies.</p><p>What were looking for is someone who can grasp concepts quickly, has great attention to detail, and most importantly loves a tech challenge.

Gebruikers in de US hebben zo snel toegang tot de site (lokale server in NYC, cloud-hosting). Voor het zware rekenwerk op de achtergrond gebruiken we eigen servers in Amsterdam.</li><li>Diverse optimalisaties doorgevoerd in de manier waarop we met API's van partners omgaan (bundeling) waardoor we met dezelfde hardware capaciteit nog veel verder kunnen groeien.</li></ul><p><strong>Wie zoeken we?</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Iemand die voornamelijk met onze back-end aan de slag gaat (&gt;90% van het werk is back-end). Front-end kennis is in principe niet eens nodig.</li><li>Je bent niet bang om nieuwe technieken te leren en toe te passen.</li><li>Je bent bereid om je handen uit de mouwen te steken. Hoewel er natuurlijk goed nagedacht moet worden over hoe iets opgezet moet worden, ligt er ook veel uitvoerend werk klaar.</li><li>Je kunt tegen opbouwende kritiek en bent ook niet bang om anderen te wijzen op verbeterpunten.</li><li>Je bent slim, vindingrijk en schrijft goede code. Dit kan je aantonen d.m.v. onze PHP-test.</li><li>Ten minste 2 jaar werkervaring als developer bij een werkgever.</li><li>Bovenal: we zoeken iemand met verantwoordelijkheidsgevoel. Je krijgt veel vrijheid (remote werken) en werkt aan een applicatie met veel gebruikers. We hopen dat jij je ook verantwoordelijk voor de ervaring die onze leden hebben met de applicatie.</li></ul><p><strong>Waarom doe je het allemaal?</strong></p><p>Wij houden ons maar met één ding bezig: onze leden optimaal ondersteunen bij het vinden van een leuke baan. Daar komt heel veel bij kijken met het aantal actieve gebruikers dat we nu hebben. Met een goed platform kunnen wij echt een verschil maken in de carrière van onze leden. Daar doen we het allemaal voor.<br>We zijn door RVO Nederland erkend als innovatief IT-bedrijf (WBSO-regeling) en zijn er trots op dat we op technisch gebied vooruitstrevend zijn.<br>Daarnaast beschikken we over een eigen IPv4-range met IP-adressen voor het versturen van onze vacature-alerts.</p><p><strong>Hoe ziet een werkweek eruit?</strong></p><p>Maandagochtend zijn we altijd met het hele team op kantoor. Na een kop koffie volgt de techniek-bespreking. Hierin wordt even een korte update gegeven over hoe het met Trending Jobs gaat (vooral: wat is de impact van de wijzigingen die afgelopen week zijn doorgevoerd? Bijv.: zien we veel positieve reacties of komen er juist klachten binnen over iets dat nog niet helemaal goed werkt)? Zijn er andere issues die aandacht nodig hebben (bijv. e-mail deliverability)?<br>Vervolgens vertelt iedereen wat hij/zij afgelopen week heeft gedaan en of hulp of advies van collega's gewenst is. Hierna bespreken we de actiepunten voor de huidige week en komen we tot een taakverdeling.<br>Hierna is het tijd voor lunch. Na de lunch gaat iedereen aan het werk met de toebedeelde taken voor die week (kan uiteraard ook een sub-taak van een heel groot project zijn). De rest van de week is het aan jou: wil je graag van kantoor werken, of werk je liever van een andere locatie? De één werkt graag binnen kantooruren en op kantoor (met collega's, koffie en verzorgde lunch), de ander houdt er liever een andere indeling op na (geen ochtendmens?). In ieder geval werk je in principe de hele week aan de toebedeelde taken. Je kunt je collega's altijd om hulp vragen, uiteraard. En als er verder geen onverwachte problemen op je pad komen bij het ontwikkelen, bespreken we de volgende maandag hoe het gegaan is en wat er allemaal live gekomen is.</p><p><strong>Team &amp; werksfeer</strong></p><ul><li>Informeel IT-team met 8 developers, waarvan 4 developers fulltime aan Trending Jobs werken (we rekenen jou even mee bij de telling).</li><ul><li>We zijn bezig met het aannemen van extra developers, dus het team zal nog wat doorgroeien.</li></ul><li>1 lead-developer voor Trending Jobs (Remco)</li><li>Management: Marcel &amp; Ramon, beiden in ieder geval aanwezig op maandag (o.a. voor wekelijkse technische bespreking). Bedenken welke features nu het beste bij zullen dragen aan een betere gebruikerservaring en snellere groei van het platform. Marcel houdt zich daarnaast o.a. bezig met de groei van Trending Jobs (ervoor zorgen dat mensen ons platform weten te vinden), het aansluiten en behouden van klanten en de financiën van Trending Jobs.</li><li>Gezellige pauze met volledig verzorgde lunch.</li></ul><p><strong>Wat bieden wij?</strong></p><ul><li>Een mooi salaris, afhankelijk van (en meegroeiend met) je&nbsp;niveau.</li><li>Vrijheid. Veel vrijheid. Mogelijkheid tot flexibel indelen van uren (geen ochtendmens, of werk je liever een paar uurtjes in het weekend in plaats van&nbsp;op woensdagochtend? Dan vinden we hier een oplossing voor).</li><li>Mogelijkheid tot thuiswerken.</li><li>Reiskostenvergoeding.</li><li>Pensioen (50% inleg werkgever).</li><li>Volledig verzorgde lunch op kantoor.</li><li>Laptop of PC van de zaak, helemaal conform jouw wensen.</li><li>24 vakantiedagen.</li><li>Af en toe een leuk bedrijfsuitje met het team, of gezellig uit eten.</li></ul><p>Verder luisteren we graag naar eventuele verbeterpunten, zodat wij een betere werkgever kunnen worden. Bijna alles kan geregeld worden.</p><p><strong>Sollicitatieprocedure</strong></p><p>Overtuigd? Super! We zullen je sollicitatie snel bekijken. Als het aannemelijk is dat je op het niveau zit dat wij zoeken, volgt nog een PHP-test (remote). Je hebt maximaal 4 uur de tijd voor deze test. Je kunt deze test uitvoeren op ieder moment dat jou uitkomt (wordt automatisch verstuurd). De uitslag gebruiken we om objectief je niveau te bepalen en je een eerlijk salarisvoorstel kunnen doen. Als de testuitslag goed is, wordt je uitgenodigd voor een kennismakingsgesprek met Remco (lead-developer) en Marcel (CEO). Bij een wederzijdse klik volgt een salarisvoorstel. We bieden in eerste instantie een contract van 3 maanden aan. Als deze eerste&nbsp;periode van 3 maanden&nbsp;wederzijds goed bevallen is, ga je over op een vast contract. Je hebt dus snel zekerheid!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/163182?reset=False&amp;ra=SJ1rrIA8ArC&amp;oqs=a%3DSJ1rrIA8ArC' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexibility (work from anywhere)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Lunch included</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Fully equiped workspace</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Retirement plan (50% paid by employer)</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

They are self-motivated, proactive, and have a strong team spirit. If you're tired of the traditional freelancing platforms, you'll be happy to hear that we’re so much more. X-Team is a community of like-minded individuals, carefully chosen to ensure that they can become part of the community of the most motivated people in the world who come together to unleash their potential. What we've created is truly special and not merely a faceless platform. X-Team is where developers go to feel truly at home together while becoming more motivated than they've ever been.<br><strong><br>How long does your vetting/interview process take?</strong></p><p>It varies depending on our immediate needs and how quickly you respond to our questions and requests. On average, it takes 1-3 weeks.</p><p>More importantly though, after a decade of interviewing developers, we've learned how important it is to respect people's time. We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p><p><strong>Will I get a job immediately after applying?</strong></p><p>If your skills, experience, and values align with a current opening we have, your chances of getting hired immediately are high. If we discover you're qualified, but all opportunities have been taken, we'll continue to work with you to help you get a role in X-Team. The key is having the most relevant, in-demand skills when you apply.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Get the chance to work with big brands</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Live and work in one of our roaming hacker houses around the world</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from anywhere as part of a community of digital nomads</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Join our vibrant community</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We provide up to $2,500 in funding for your growth &amp; wellbeing</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Gym reimbursement</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

    "content": "_About SpeechKit_    <br /><br />SpeechKit is a fast-growing audio-as-a-service product for news publishers. We are building a complete toolkit to assist in the production, distribution and monetisation of audio content that will help digital news publishers reach new audiences and engage existing subscribers.<br /><br />Our business is reaching an inflection point and we are quickly onboarding new publishers by the day. This business is quickly evolving into an exciting new provider of a brand new format of news.<br /><br />We are a lean team in a phase of consolidation. This is an opportunity to join an early stage business in a high growth market providing the first of its kind service.<br /><br />_The Role_<br /><br />We are looking for a mid-level engineer with experience in leading a team in building B2B Saas products. Whilst the role is for the lead engineer in our team, we are looking for a candidate that not only has experience across our stack but also shows a willingness and enthusiasm to lead our product development through this exciting phase. <br /><br />The role will involve, but not be limited to, the following; <br /><br />* Helping define the product roadmap alongside CEO and COO.<br />* Ownership and responsibility for technical product development.<br />* Hands-on technical development across the stack.<br />* Leadership and management of the technical team.<br /><br />We currently rely heavily on contractual work for the majority of our development. It will be your job to transition from this model and lay the foundations for a team capable of sustaining our growth through the following years.<br /><br />_Core technology stack experience:_<br /><br />* Ruby on Rails 5.<br />* Python (RSS/URL text extraction).<br />* PHP (WordPress plugin development).<br />* Javascript, HTML, CSS.<br />* PostgreSQL.<br />* ELK (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana).<br />* AWS, DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, Heroku.<br /><br />_What would make you stand out;_<br /><br />* Experience and interest in machine learning and speech synthesis.<br />* Google NLP API expertise.<br />* Audio encoding know-how (ffmpeg and HLS).<br />* Background in statistics.<br />* Voice/sound design experience.<br />* Experience with media players and advertising standards e.g., VAAST and DAAST.<br />* Experience with smart speaker technology e.g., Alexa and Google Home.<br />* Mobile SDK development.<br />* React Native.<br /><br />_More about SpeechKit_<br /><br />We are a young team who have been chasing a vision for on-the-go audio news for the best part of a decade. The two founders have 10 years experience running startups between them and Speechkit is an evolution of two previous startups that has moulded a business we believe to have hit a sweet spot in an emerging market. <br /><br />We launched an MVP product in March this year and have experienced 30% growth month-on-month since that launch. We are now entering a phase of consolidation of the product, marketing and business process to ensure steady growth into the next phase of the business. <br /><br />We are well funded and ready to scale the team and business to mirror our growth prospects. Currently, we are working semi-remote and will be taking office space in mid-September. This role will be location flexible, meaning you will, for the most part, be able to manage your time working from the location of your choice or have a desk at the office. <br /><br />_Salary and Perks_<br /><br />This is an opportunity to join a dynamic and exciting business at its inception. We are looking to at a base salary for this role of £65,000 and will make judgements on an increase if expertise expands into relevant fields. Share options will also be negotiated after 3 months of the role. Holiday will start at 25 days, with flexible working location conditions. We will endeavour to meet any other suggestions you have for the role and its rewards.",

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span></p><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>1. Solve Interesting Problems</span></p><p><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</span></p><p><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We don’t work like that.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</span></p><p><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>4. Get Expert Guidance</span></p><p><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</span></p><p><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</span></p><p><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>7. Stability You Can Count On</span></p><p><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</span></p><p><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</span></p><h2><span>Here’s What We Expect From You…</span></h2><ul><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’re excellent at PHP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have an excellent attention to detail</span></li></ul><p><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our top-notch in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li><li>Everything is secondary to the&nbsp;<i>customer experience</i>. We expect you to have a keen sense of how your code will impact the experience in terms of performance, security and usability.</li><li>You'll be working with product people that challenge you to get better every day. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy work that moves the needle for businesses around the world.</li></ul><div><h3>About you</h3></div><ul><li>You are very experienced with modern PHP development practices and open source frameworks. You’ve worked on these sorts of projects at scale and feel confident solving complex problems. You view “best practices” as a starting point for critical thinking, rather than a dogma to follow.</li><li>You have created Backbone (or a similar framework) single page applications before and can write JavaScript from scratch to implement a feature. Marionette and/or React experience is a bonus, but not required. We can help you pick it up.</li><li>Your code is not only reliable and performant for customers, but can be read, maintained and understood easily by other engineers on your team. The&nbsp;<a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/' rel='nofollow'>Zen of Python</a>&nbsp;resonates with you for any language.</li><li>You believe in writing unit and integration tests and have at least tried TDD. You like owning the quality of the code you write — QA doesn’t mean throwing it over the wall for someone else to test. You understand that some things are too costly to automate and must be manually tested to get it right.</li><li>You take pride in your work and ownership of the solutions you build. When a team member or customer is in need, you feel a sense of urgency to understand their pain and thoughtfully help.</li><li>You are curious and constantly learning. Believing that “a rising tide lifts all ships,” you make everyone around you better sharing what you have learned and looking for ways to improve both yourself and the team.</li><li>You enjoy the finish work and detail required to deliver a rich product with exceptional UX. From UI interactions to handling important edge cases, you take satisfaction in delivering a solid experience that delights the users, adds value to the business, and lasts over time.</li><li>You are a humble professional who wants to be challenged by the work and not the workload. You are willing to ask for help when necessary and unafraid to say, “I don’t know.” At the same time, you have the confidence to take on complex and challenging problems.</li><li>You are proactive about solving problems and improving things. You take the initiative to build tools and processes that will help everyone. When working in the codebase, you leave things better than you found them.</li><li>You are an excellent communicator who can write and speak with empathy for our customers and team. You can easily communicate complex ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences. Clear communication is super important in a remote culture like ours.</li><li>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea. You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.</li><li>You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM - 6PM ET).</li></ul><div><h3>Benefits</h3></div><ul><li><span>Competitive Salary</span>&nbsp;- We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well.
