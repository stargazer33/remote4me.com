We're looking for an amazing developer who is well versed in either the Magento or Drupal platform (both would be amazing). You will have the opportunity to work with leading companies and marketing teams to develop complex sites and integrations between systems.</p><p>We are a fully distributed team that primarily builds in PHP on the Magento and Drupal platforms for ecommerce and content management sites. Since we are fully remote, you can work from anywhere! We do require at least 4 hours of working time overlap with the Pacific time zone work day where most of our clients are located. As a highly client focused organization, you will occasionally need to meet according to their schedule. This typically falls between 10 and 5 Pacific time, and we strive to give you plenty of time to focus on development.</p><p>Working with a variety of clients, we fluidly form groups including a Technical Project Manager, a Quality Analyst, and one or more developers to complete sprints of work. The type of work depends on the client, but often includes:</p><ul><li>Developing custom modules and extensions for Drupal CMS and Magento Commerce.</li><li>Integration with various APIs and third-party systems.</li><li>Migrating existing sites to modern platforms.</li><li>Knowledgeable with front-end development: HTML/CSS/Javascript coding, with Twig and PHP at the template level</li></ul><p>With Bear Group, you will tackle technical problems, code and debug primarily PHP/javascript/css, and occasionally participate in client meetings. You will need to be self-motivating and able to work independently most of the time, but we have a friendly and capable team to collaborate with when you encounter obstacles. Since the technology world is constantly evolving, you’ll be expected to keep up with the current technologies and practices. To help with this, we provide an annual education stipend that can be used for attending relevant conferences or continued education courses.</p><p>During your first week you will work closely with one of our senior developers to set up your new system and familiarize with our processes and tools. The system will be either Mac, Linux, or Windows to your preference, and we use Vagrant to manage virtual machines for a consistent development server stack. Other tools you will use include:</p><ul><li>Git for source control</li><li>Bitbucket for Git repositories</li><li>Jira for project management</li><li>Confluence for documentation</li><li>Slack for communication.</li></ul><p>As you get your feet under you we will introduce some project work, again in collaboration with a senior developer on a sprint they are currently working on. Ultimately our developers work independently on your own tickets and sprints.</p><p>In addition to competitive pay, a new computer, insurance, and 401k match, you’ll also receive:</p><ul><li>3 Weeks PTO plus approximately 10 vacation days annually</li><li>$1500 annual education stipend</li><li>Software stipend for the tools that you prefer to do the job</li></ul><p><br>To learn more about the company, visit&nbsp;<a href='http://www.beargroup.com/' rel='nofollow'>www.beargroup.com</a>.

We need someone who is strong from front end to back end.<br> 3.) Microservices - Additional experience with API's and integration will be very helpful.<br> Job Description:<br> TEKsystems has partnered with a diversified Energy provider to provide them with a Senior Consultant in support of a Web Application build. This web application will involve a heavy focus on Microservices and building API's for various internal systems. The end goal of the system is a two way communication channel between Client and they're customers. Qualified candidates will have significant experience across Drupal 8 running full stack development.<br> Non-Technical Skills: <br> This person can work remote so their communication skills have to be top notch. Also the client is a very cyber security focused organization so security focused coding practices need to be highly considered.<br> Lastly, this person may need to evaluate some of the code that has already been pushed to production for phase 1. There is some concern about the quality of that code and would like it to be reviewed.<br><br><b>About TEKsystems:</b><br><b>We're partners in transformation. We help clients activate ideas and solutions to take advantage of a new world of opportunity.

We focus on hiring people who, first and foremost, share the passion of our mission and our customers, and who have an unequivocal commitment to excellence, hard work, and love of neighbor. We also insist on supporting every team member’s personal priorities, recognizing that our work is not often the most important thing in each of our lives. And that only when a person’s work at Flocknote aligns in some way with their own personal dreams will they be truly happy and most productive.&nbsp;</p><p>We manage our team based on good personal relationships, offering flexible schedules and a 35 hour work week, allowing people to put family first, understanding each other, and holding frequent one-on-one meetings between all levels of management and each team member. Though we are a remote company, we make in-person team gatherings a top priority. Our in-person gatherings include a little work, team service projects, live interactions with customers, and of course a little fun, too (including beach houses, axe throwing, escape rooms and more!). We also make it a point to have virtual parties throughout the year celebrating various holidays, such as Halloween, Christmas, and even National Donut Day.&nbsp;</p><p>Central to our culture, we are each committed to growing in our 10 governing virtues each day and allowing them to govern our work and relationships. Our 10 governing virtues are: Humility, Veracity, Patience, Courage, Justice, Wisdom, Temperance, Faith, Hope, and Love. At every weekly team meeting, we assign a different team member to share a reflection (typically a quote or story) on one of our governing virtues.</p><p>Ultimately, we are not just coworkers, but friends, who truly care for one another and help each other to be successful and happy.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>35 hour work week</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible work schedules</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical/dental/vision benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Choice of the specific tech equipment you use (e.g., PC or Mac)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>4 weeks vacation + up to 18 company days off per year</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salaries</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Maternity and Paternity leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We put family first</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Along with that, you’ll be responsible for ensuring adherence to programming and \\ndocumentation policies, code standards, testing, release, and reporting updates on your projects.\\n\\n- What will you contribute to? \\nYou will contribute to code reviews, feedback for ideas (including the ideas for other areas of the \\ncompany), and hiring new teammates in the Product Team.\\n\\n- What will you support? \\nOutside of generally supporting your teammates in the Product Circle, Rebilly is an open \\nenvironment where everyone is welcome in every area of the company. You are welcome to \\nsupport any project you feel called to participate in. \\n\\n- How much support per project? \\nYou can ask as many teammates to join your project as you need to complete the mission. \\n\\n\\n**SOME OF THE PROJECTS WE ARE WORKING ON**\\n- Customer Billing Portal - create a secure and highly customizable customer billing portal\\n\\n- Auth Service - decompose the monolith application into loosely coupled services\\n\\n- Metered Billing - ongoing development of our billing solutions\\n\\n- Automation - integration with small business software\\n\\n- Dashboards - create reporting API’s for our clients' dashboards\\n\\n\\n\\n**APPLY!**\\n\\nPlease send your resume through Apply By API: [https://app.applybyapi.com/posting/7/](https://app.applybyapi.com/posting/7/)\\n\\n\\n\\n**HIRING PROCESS**\\n- Apply By API* - [https://app.applybyapi.com/posting/7/](https://app.applybyapi.com/posting/7/)\\n- Small code challenge (unless you have extensive open source contributions)\\n- Interview with the Product Team \\n- Interview with the Product Team Lead\\n- Offer and Hiring \\nThe total process should take less than 2 weeks.\\n*We are only accepting applications through ApplyByAPI at this time.\\n\\n\\n\\n**WORKING AT REBILLY**\\n\\nCheck us out at [https://www.rebilly.com/careers/](https://www.rebilly.com/careers/)\\n\\nRebilly offers a competitive salary, training and development, birthday lunches, and provides the computer of your choosing. You are welcome to work out of our Montreal office, remotely out of Austin (occasionally meeting with our team here for lunch or happy hour, otherwise set up as a 100% remote/work from home environment), or anywhere on the globe that you choose as a fully remote employee. Further perks and benefits are dependent on your work location of choice. \\n\\nRebilly is a Teal Organization, meaning our organizational structure may differ than what you’re used to, but we think you’ll be pleasantly surprised. In a very tiny nutshell, this means that as an organization we value self-management, self-organization, as well as the wholeness of the individuals that make up our team (meaning you should be yourself at work, and do the work that inspires you.) \\n\\n\\n**ABOUT REBILLY**\\n\\nRebilly is subscription billing software that helps businesses who need to handle recurring invoices and payments. Rebilly’s comprehensive feature set is built to help our merchants get more of their customers from the order form to the thank you page, and more renewals paid. We took lessons learned from years of experience in the subscription business and millions of subscribers and applied them to make our payment system clever, flexible, and easy to use for our clients.  </div> </div>",

In a very tiny nutshell, this means that as an organization we value self-management, self-organization, as well as the wholeness of the individuals that make up our team (meaning you should be yourself at work, and do the work that inspires you.) **ABOUT REBILLY**Rebilly is subscription billing software that helps businesses who need to handle recurring invoices and payments. Rebilly’s comprehensive feature set is built to help our merchants get more of their customers from the order form to the thank you page, and more renewals paid.

You are an internpreneur: a hacker or designer, journalist or marketer, idea person or data quant, MBA candidate with years of experience or university student looking for their first gig.</p><br /><p>An internpreneur approaches their career like an entrepreneur: able and eager to get things done and innovate with limited resources. You think ahead and want to learn how companies and careers grow before jumping in the deep end of the entrepreneurial/career pool entirely on your own. What else?</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You are able to execute in startup time and independently figure out things that are entirely new</li><br /><li>You believe business can make the world a better place (while keeping an eye on the bottom line)</li><br /><li>You want to improve the business world - and yourself</li><br /><li>You have experience in one or more of the following technologies: Javascript / PHP / MongoDB</li><br /><li>Willingness to learn one or more of the following technologies: Angular.js / Symfony2 / Docker</li><br /></ul><br /><p><br /><strong>WHAT CAN RELAYTO/ DO FOR ME?</strong></p><br /><p>Re-think grad school: gain an education, experience, and amazing connections.</p><br /><p>If you're not ready to launch your own venture or don't quite know who you want to be professionally, we are a great foundation. Get in on the ground floor of an awesome and innovative company.</p><br /><p>If you are curious about the specific role - reach out to us. But broadly speaking, the range of opportunities and responsibilities include:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Define customer needs and usability specs. Be the champion of our users</li><br /><li>Craft breakthrough designs and architecture</li><br /><li>Build solutions. Find and create best practices templates for key activities in computer science, UI/UX, user feedback, etc.</li><br /><li>Build and test new product prototypes. Get instant feedback</li><br /><li>Depending on your professional goals and RELAYTO's needs, this internship would be designed to balance your learning with specific business requirements</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>WHY GET EXCITED?</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>A big vision product that&rsquo;ll improve how people and groups create, communicate and work together, with potential appeal to everyone who wants to share knowledge or learn.</li><br /><li>An experienced, proven team that has previously built and sold the largest business applications in the cloud and on the desktop.</li><br /><li>Exciting product challenges, in both architecture, product management and user experience.</li><br /><li>A team that gives the opportunity to young talent and values the diversity of experience and perspective.</li><br /><li>A driven set of individuals that genuinely enjoy working with one another: solving problems; refining designs; creating, learning and growing together.</li><br /><li>A jerk-free culture defined by trust, respect, and empathy.</li><br /><li>A company that&rsquo;s advised by some of the smartest experts in the business.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>WHERE AND WHEN?</strong></p><br /><p>Meet us in some of the coolest cities in the world or work remotely.</p><br /><p>We are a location-free startup, currently spanning London, Paris, Johannesburg &amp; San Francisco. We encourage flexibility and opportunity for working virtually or in physical teams, depending on your preference. The primary location for in-person meetings will be San Francisco, London and Paris.</p><br /><p>We require at least a 20 hours/week commitment from interns working remotely during the school year.</p>",

Innovative stuff for an industry still handling bookings via spreadsheets and phone calls.   <br>   <br>For our R&amp;D team based in Amsterdam, that means building and connecting APIs, setting standards, dealing with high-throughput and large datasets – all with smart processing. We then top it off with seriously slick UI which allows clients to manage campaigns, configure their connections and analyse trading.   <br>   <br>The next part of our tech offering is Console, an e-commerce solution that lets media owners sell direct to advertisers.   <br>   <br>By joining our tight-knit team you’ll be integral to developing and delivering this product as it continues to evolve.

Join us, and you’ll be challenged and supported in equal measure. <br /><br />The role<br />We are looking for a full stack developer who can help define and build the customer-facing side of our business. The role will include:<br />Joining a small, autonomous, agile team using modern web development methodologies such as continuous delivery.<br />Working with your team to come up with ideas and define the backlog, with the aim of solving real customer problems.<br />Bringing new features to life, from initial design through to writing well structured modular code, automated tests, and deployment. <br />Working closely with other teams around the office, including product managers, marketing and customer support. <br /><br />What we’re looking for<br />We don’t have an ideal candidate, and aptitude and a willingness to learn are just as important than qualifications or experience. With that said, having familiarity with some of the technologies and methodologies below would be beneficial: <br />Prior experience and success building products as  a full stack developer.<br />Knowledge of PHP 7, and a modern framework such as Laravel or Symfony.<br />Experience building and using scalable APIs.<br />Familiarity with modern devops, including deployment pipelines. <br />Fluency with at least one major Javascript framework (ideally Vue, but experience in React or Angular would also be applicable).<br />An understanding of scalable frontend architecture.<br />Familiarity with modern tooling such as Grunt/Gulp, Webpack, Docker, Git etc.<br /><br />If you have skills that align with this role and you could contribute to our goals but your experience or salary expectations don't match what we're offering, don't be put off. We look for the right people and we are flexible, so we'd still encourage applications from strong candidates.<br /><br />Benefits:<br />Some of our benefits include:<br />25 days holiday, with an extra day for each year you are with us (up to 28). <br />An additional 5 days holiday through salary sacrifice.<br />Genuinely flexible working, with remote working on Wednesdays. <br />A great office environment, including free fruit, beer on Thursday afternoons, and regular company-organised socials. <br />Regular conference opportunities and a dedicated training budget. <br />A generous equity scheme for senior employees. <br /><br />Please send CV’s if you feel you would be a good fit for this role. We look forward to hearing from you.",
