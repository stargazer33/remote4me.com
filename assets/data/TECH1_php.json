You’ll do whatever it takes to cross the finish line.</p><p><strong>Resourceful</strong> | When you don’t know an answer, you know how to find it. When there’s not a solution, you make a solution. You have the creativity it takes to find a way to get the job done.</p><p><strong>Social Savant</strong> | You’re great with people. You can empathize and connect with them on a relational level. Your emotional intelligence is spot on, allowing you to know exactly when to open your mouth and when to close it and simply open your ears.<br><br><strong>Servant-Minded</strong> | Your focus is on making others successful. &nbsp;You're not worried about who gets the credit. You're humble and able to admit and take responsibility when you drop the ball, learning from the experience to improve next time.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical and Dental Insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401K Profit Sharing</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life and Disability Insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>PTO and Holiday Pay</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Maternity and Paternity Paid Leave</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We focus on hiring people who, first and foremost, share the passion of our mission and our customers, and who have an unequivocal commitment to excellence, hard work, and love of neighbor. We also insist on supporting every team member’s personal priorities, recognizing that our work is not often the most important thing in each of our lives. And that only when a person’s work at Flocknote aligns in some way with their own personal dreams will they be truly happy and most productive.&nbsp;</p><p>We manage our team based on good personal relationships, offering flexible schedules and a 35 hour work week, allowing people to put family first, understanding each other, and holding frequent one-on-one meetings between all levels of management and each team member. Though we are a remote company, we make in-person team gatherings a top priority. Our in-person gatherings include a little work, team service projects, live interactions with customers, and of course a little fun, too (including beach houses, axe throwing, escape rooms and more!). We also make it a point to have virtual parties throughout the year celebrating various holidays, such as Halloween, Christmas, and even National Donut Day.&nbsp;</p><p>Central to our culture, we are each committed to growing in our 10 governing virtues each day and allowing them to govern our work and relationships. Our 10 governing virtues are: Humility, Veracity, Patience, Courage, Justice, Wisdom, Temperance, Faith, Hope, and Love. At every weekly team meeting, we assign a different team member to share a reflection (typically a quote or story) on one of our governing virtues.</p><p>Ultimately, we are not just coworkers, but friends, who truly care for one another and help each other to be successful and happy.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>35 hour work week</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible work schedules</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical/dental/vision benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Choice of the specific tech equipment you use (e.g., PC or Mac)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>4 weeks vacation + up to 18 company days off per year</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salaries</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Maternity and Paternity leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We put family first</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

It revolutionizes how any individual or organization creates and shares knowledge with their audience, and measures impact. It gives you simple, slick, and smart features to communicate with your colleagues, prospects, and customers. Think Squarespace for documents - proposals, presentations, reports, emails and more - no design or coding needed.</p><br /><p>Check out some of the reasons we think it's a game-changer for professionals and businesses.</p><br /><p><strong>AM I A GOOD FIT?</strong><br />You are not an average intern looking to claw your way to middle management at a bank for the next 10 years. You are an internpreneur: a hacker or designer, journalist or marketer, idea person or data quant, MBA candidate with years of experience or university student looking for their first gig.</p><br /><p>An internpreneur approaches their career like an entrepreneur: able and eager to get things done and innovate with limited resources. You think ahead and want to learn how companies and careers grow before jumping in the deep end of the entrepreneurial/career pool entirely on your own. What else?</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You are able to execute in startup time and independently figure out things that are entirely new</li><br /><li>You believe business can make the world a better place (while keeping an eye on the bottom line)</li><br /><li>You want to improve the business world - and yourself</li><br /><li>You have experience in one or more of the following technologies: Javascript / PHP / MongoDB</li><br /><li>Willingness to learn one or more of the following technologies: Angular.js / Symfony2 / Docker</li><br /></ul><br /><p><br /><strong>WHAT CAN RELAYTO/ DO FOR ME?</strong></p><br /><p>Re-think grad school: gain an education, experience, and amazing connections.</p><br /><p>If you're not ready to launch your own venture or don't quite know who you want to be professionally, we are a great foundation. Get in on the ground floor of an awesome and innovative company.</p><br /><p>If you are curious about the specific role - reach out to us. But broadly speaking, the range of opportunities and responsibilities include:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Define customer needs and usability specs. Be the champion of our users</li><br /><li>Craft breakthrough designs and architecture</li><br /><li>Build solutions. Find and create best practices templates for key activities in computer science, UI/UX, user feedback, etc.</li><br /><li>Build and test new product prototypes. Get instant feedback</li><br /><li>Depending on your professional goals and RELAYTO's needs, this internship would be designed to balance your learning with specific business requirements</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>WHY GET EXCITED?</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>A big vision product that&rsquo;ll improve how people and groups create, communicate and work together, with potential appeal to everyone who wants to share knowledge or learn.</li><br /><li>An experienced, proven team that has previously built and sold the largest business applications in the cloud and on the desktop.</li><br /><li>Exciting product challenges, in both architecture, product management and user experience.</li><br /><li>A team that gives the opportunity to young talent and values the diversity of experience and perspective.</li><br /><li>A driven set of individuals that genuinely enjoy working with one another: solving problems; refining designs; creating, learning and growing together.</li><br /><li>A jerk-free culture defined by trust, respect, and empathy.</li><br /><li>A company that&rsquo;s advised by some of the smartest experts in the business.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>WHERE AND WHEN?</strong></p><br /><p>Meet us in some of the coolest cities in the world or work remotely.</p><br /><p>We are a location-free startup, currently spanning London, Paris, Johannesburg &amp; San Francisco. We encourage flexibility and opportunity for working virtually or in physical teams, depending on your preference. The primary location for in-person meetings will be San Francisco, London and Paris.</p><br /><p>We require at least a 20 hours/week commitment from interns working remotely during the school year.</p>",

We now have over 10,000 tutors across the UK delivering over 10,000 lessons per week, both in person and online. Our revolutionary approach to tutoring and our fantastic growth have helped us become recognised as one of the top 100 startups in the UK.<br /><br />We’re building a stellar team to help us achieve our goal. We strive to create an environment where you can do your best work - our people are empowered to make the bold decisions others wouldn’t, and make a genuine impact on the lives of thousands of young learners. Join us, and you’ll be challenged and supported in equal measure. <br /><br />The role<br />We are looking for a full stack developer who can help define and build the customer-facing side of our business. The role will include:<br />Joining a small, autonomous, agile team using modern web development methodologies such as continuous delivery.<br />Working with your team to come up with ideas and define the backlog, with the aim of solving real customer problems.<br />Bringing new features to life, from initial design through to writing well structured modular code, automated tests, and deployment. <br />Working closely with other teams around the office, including product managers, marketing and customer support. <br /><br />What we’re looking for<br />We don’t have an ideal candidate, and aptitude and a willingness to learn are just as important than qualifications or experience. With that said, having familiarity with some of the technologies and methodologies below would be beneficial: <br />Prior experience and success building products as  a full stack developer.<br />Knowledge of PHP 7, and a modern framework such as Laravel or Symfony.<br />Experience building and using scalable APIs.<br />Familiarity with modern devops, including deployment pipelines. <br />Fluency with at least one major Javascript framework (ideally Vue, but experience in React or Angular would also be applicable).<br />An understanding of scalable frontend architecture.<br />Familiarity with modern tooling such as Grunt/Gulp, Webpack, Docker, Git etc.<br /><br />If you have skills that align with this role and you could contribute to our goals but your experience or salary expectations don't match what we're offering, don't be put off. We look for the right people and we are flexible, so we'd still encourage applications from strong candidates.<br /><br />Benefits:<br />Some of our benefits include:<br />25 days holiday, with an extra day for each year you are with us (up to 28). <br />An additional 5 days holiday through salary sacrifice.<br />Genuinely flexible working, with remote working on Wednesdays. <br />A great office environment, including free fruit, beer on Thursday afternoons, and regular company-organised socials. <br />Regular conference opportunities and a dedicated training budget. <br />A generous equity scheme for senior employees. <br /><br />Please send CV’s if you feel you would be a good fit for this role. We look forward to hearing from you.",

We’re looking for an amazing developer who is well versed in either the Magento or Drupal platform (both would be amazing). You will have the opportunity to work with leading companies and marketing teams to develop complex sites and integrations between systems.</p>\n <p>We are a fully distributed team that primarily builds in PHP on the Magento and Drupal platforms for ecommerce and content management sites. <strong>Since we are fully remote, you can work from anywhere! We do require at least 4 hours of working time overlap with the Pacific time zone work day</strong> where most of our clients are located. As a highly client focused organization, you will occasionally need to meet according to their schedule. This typically falls between 10 and 5 Pacific time, and we strive to give you plenty of time to focus on development.</p>\n <p>Working with a variety of clients, we fluidly form groups including a Technical Project Manager, a Quality Analyst, and one or more developers to complete sprints of work.</p>\n <p><strong>The type of work depends on the client, but often includes:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Developing custom modules and extensions for Drupal CMS and Magento Commerce.</li>\n  <li>Integration with various APIs and third-party systems.</li>\n  <li>Migrating existing sites to modern platforms.</li>\n  <li>Knowledgeable with front-end development: HTML/CSS/Javascript coding, with Twig and PHP at the template level</li>\n </ul>\n <p>With Bear Group, you will tackle technical problems, code and debug primarily PHP/javascript/css, and occasionally participate in client meetings. You will need to be self-motivating and able to work independently most of the time, but we have a friendly and capable team to collaborate with when you encounter obstacles. Since the technology world is constantly evolving, you’ll be expected to keep up with the current technologies and practices. To help with this, we provide an annual education stipend that can be used for attending relevant conferences or continued education courses.</p>\n <p>During your first week you will work closely with one of our senior developers to set up your new system and familiarize with our processes and tools.

    "content": "<h3> Drupal / Magento Developer </h3>\n<div>\n <div>\n  Bear Group is a leading web development firm based in Seattle looking for an experienced backend web developer to join our team of Drupal and Magento. We're looking for an amazing developer who is well versed in either the Magento or Drupal platform (both would be amazing). You will have the opportunity to work with leading companies and marketing teams to develop complex sites and integrations between systems.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We are a fully distributed team that primarily builds in PHP on the Magento and Drupal platforms for ecommerce and content management sites. Since we are fully remote, you can work from anywhere! We do require at least 4 hours of working time overlap with the Pacific time zone work day where most of our clients are located. As a highly client focused organization, you will occasionally need to meet according to their schedule. This typically falls between 10 and 5 Pacific time, and we strive to give you plenty of time to focus on development.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Working with a variety of clients, we fluidly form groups including a Technical Project Manager, a Quality Analyst, and one or more developers to complete sprints of work. The type of work depends on the client, but often includes:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Developing custom modules and extensions for Drupal CMS and Magento Commerce.</li>\n  <li>Integration with various APIs and third-party systems.</li>\n  <li>Migrating existing sites to modern platforms.</li>\n  <li>Knowledgeable with front-end development: HTML/CSS/Javascript coding, with Twig and PHP at the template level</li>\n </ul>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  With Bear Group, you will tackle technical problems, code and debug primarily PHP/javascript/css, and occasionally participate in client meetings. You will need to be self-motivating and able to work independently most of the time, but we have a friendly and capable team to collaborate with when you encounter obstacles. Since the technology world is constantly evolving, you’ll be expected to keep up with the current technologies and practices. To help with this, we provide an annual education stipend that can be used for attending relevant conferences or continued education courses.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  During your first week you will work closely with one of our senior developers to set up your new system and familiarize with our processes and tools. The system will be either Mac, Linux, or Windows to your preference, and we use Vagrant to manage virtual machines for a consistent development server stack. Other tools you will use include:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Git for source control</li>\n  <li>Bitbucket for Git repositories</li>\n  <li>Jira for project management</li>\n  <li>Confluence for documentation</li>\n  <li>Slack for communication.</li>\n </ul>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  As you get your feet under you we will introduce some project work, again in collaboration with a senior developer on a sprint they are currently working on. Ultimately our developers work independently on your own tickets and sprints.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  In addition to competitive pay, a new computer, insurance, and 401k match, you’ll also receive:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>3 Weeks PTO plus approximately 10 vacation days annually</li>\n  <li>$1500 annual education stipend</li>\n  <li>Software stipend for the tools that you prefer to do the job</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  To learn more about the company, visit&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://www.beargroup.com/' rel='nofollow'>www.beargroup.com</a>. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n</div>",

Do you hate to compromise on code quality because of clients and deadlines? Then read on! \n  <br> \n  <br>We're a product-focused organization, which means our codebase is our baby; it can never become too perfect and we continually push our ambitions upwards. \n  <br>We're also the world's leading User Experience (UX) community—with over 1,5 million monthly visitors—and the biggest course platform for designers on the planet. Forbes Magazine has written about us and, what's more, we teach UX and Design to organizations like IBM and the British Parliament. We can offer you the freedom to shape your work schedule, as well as a priceless opportunity to make an impact on the world—you'll improve hundreds of thousands of lives each year. \n  <br> \n  <br>With that in mind, we'd love if you could help us take our codebase to the next level. \n  <br> \n  <br># Responsibilities \n  <br> You will join our team as a Senior Full-Stack Developer and your main responsibilities will be as follows: \n  <br>* Make principal architectural decisions together with back-end and front-end developers. \n  <br>* Communicate with our design team, write specifications for the components of the new [IDF Design System](https://s3.amazonaws.com/idfprofilepictures/hiring/IDF+Design+System+-+Proposal.pdf) and implement them. \n  <br>* Implement new features by writing readable, maintainable and testable code (using Laravel and/or Vanilla JS/Vue.js). \n  <br>* Reuse and improve existing solutions and components. \n  <br>* Write automated tests for critical parts of your code. What's more: We are TDD friendly! \n  <br>* Adopt the codebase as your baby and constantly refactor it towards perfection. \n  <br> \n  <br>**A future-proof tech stack** \n  <br>* We use the latest stable version of PHP7 because it increasingly offers features like strict type declarations. \n  <br>* We leverage the elegance, simplicity and readability of the latest Laravel version and features. \n  <br>* We want to spend our precious time on things that matter the most; that's why we perfect our easy to run development environment with Docker, VM and custom scripts. \n  <br>* We empower our automated tests with PHPUnit and Laravel Dusk. \n  <br>* We support evergreen browsers only (ES2015+, grid layout, CSS custom variables, etc). \n  <br>* We constantly refactor our front-end code with the goal to reach front-end heaven: \n  <br>1.&nbsp;**VanillaJS**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Vue.js**&nbsp;for its simplicity and flexibility that comes with a very small size and great performance. \n  <br>1.&nbsp;**PostCSS**&nbsp;to maximize the power of modern CSS. \n  <br>1.&nbsp;**Webpack**&nbsp;for perfect control over front-end assets. \n  <br>1.&nbsp;**Cypress.io**&nbsp;and Jest for automated tests. \n  <br>1.&nbsp;**PWA**&nbsp;with offline experience. \n  <br>* Mixed multi-page application and single-page (for the most interactive parts). \n  <br>* We️ ❤️ CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery) so we usually deploy a few releases per day: Zero downtime. Just a few buttons to push. No sweaty palms. \n  <br>* We care about Developer Experience (DX) of our codebase and tools. DX and DevOps is our middle name: git, GitHub, Docker, HTTP2, CDN, AWS and much more.&nbsp;** \n  <br> \n  <br>**Work conditions** \n  <br>* 100% remote full-time work with team trips 1-2 times a year in different places on the planet. \n  <br>* Flexible work schedule with minimal meetings. \n  <br>* Team of true professionals and smooth onboarding process with a personal mentor. \n  <br>* A culture of learning and excellence: \n  <br>1. In our code reviews, we constructively reference [specific evergreen principles](https://github.com/InteractionDesignFoundation/handbook/blob/master/library/front-end/clean-code-js.md) of programming to supercharge our learning. \n  <br>1. We actively use a library of evergreen literature on [front-end](https://github.com/InteractionDesignFoundation/handbook/blob/master/library/front-end/literature.md) and [back-end](https://github.com/InteractionDesignFoundation/handbook/blob/master/library/back-end/literature.md) development-related subjects. \n  <br>1. We believe that building timeless knowledge enables us to see through the hype and focus on what really matters. \n  <br> \n  <br># Requirements \n  <br>* You have expert knowledge of PHP. \n  <br>* You have 6+ years of experience working professionally with OOP + MVC (preferably web technologies). \n  <br>* Your work is based on a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals from data structures and algorithms to design patterns. \n  <br>* You have substantial experience working with RESTful web services and ORM concepts. \n  <br>* You love to learn through doing. You’re ready to put in some hard work to expand your skills. \n  <br>* You speak and write to an acceptable level of English. \n  <br>* You are a team player and you don't bring your ego to work. \n  <br>* You are self-motivated and self-disciplined and thus work well in a flat hierarchy with lots of freedom. \n  <br>* You love to have creative freedom, make independent judgments and live up to the responsibility that comes with that freedom. \n  <br>* You love to make a positive impact on the world and the lives of others. \n  <br> \n  <br>#Location \n  <br>- Worldwide \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

We're a dynamic team of practicing professionals, researchers, and scholars, with a passion to help students reach their academic and career goals. We often go above and beyond to deliver the best possible services we can for our students. We take our own medicine and we are constantly training to keep our individual performance and the performance of our company exceptional.</p>\n <p>In addition, we are also creating the next generation of university admissions screening software to reduce the social, racial and economic bias while being able to select better-suited applicants AND save time and money for universities and employers.</p>\n <p>We take our role very seriously and contribute to our company on a regular basis whether we work part-time or full-time because we understand the long-term impact of our work. We know how to manage our time and competing demands. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our services and impact and we are not afraid to share our ideas and collaborate with our team members.</p>\n <p>We put our company and our missions first before our own personal needs and desires. This is not a &quot;job&quot; to us. This is a calling. Our passion for mentoring our students and making admissions fair and scientifically sound is what gets us up in the morning. Importantly, we understand that our company is only as great as its individual members. That's how we have become a leading academic consulting firm and that's why we are extremely selective about our team and only pick the very best to join us and we do everything we can to support them.</p>\n <p><strong>We'll be honest; working at BeMo isn't for everyone.</strong></p>\n <p>If you are resistant to learn more and continuous coaching because you believe you already know everything about programming, if you are seeking a side job just to make a few bucks, or to add another entry to your resume, if you normally don't pay much attention to detail and your code is always returned by end users full of bugs, or if you are looking for a short-term gig with little impact and growth, then we're probably not right for you.</p>\n <p></p>\n <p>If you are a fantastic developer with great attention to detail, yet extremely humble, willing to learn more and are not afraid to explore topics that are not your expertise, love to be a part of the team to change the future of higher education and admissions screening, and looking for a long-term mission with significant impact on society, then you need to apply. Now.</p>\n <p><strong>What we offer:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Be a part of our fast growing, innovative and leading academic consulting firm.</li>\n  <li>Be part of a revolution. We are creating the next generation of candidate selection tools that are light years ahead at selecting best-suited candidates compared to traditional tools, while being fair to applicants.</li>\n  <li>Be part of a team of A-players. We only hire the brightest individuals with the highest caliber, character and courage.</li>\n  <li>Freedom to choose your hours. We don't believe in 9-5.

We share a love of tech, design, and business, and a gung-ho urge to zag when everyone else zigs. All of us care deeply about our work and our partners in that work. This gutsy, authentic approach makes us a great fit for eCommerce retailers throughout the country. \n  <br>Gauge has grown steadily since 2007, and we are poised to shift into high gear in 2017. We take the long-term view, both in-house and with our clients, so we need someone organized, proactive, and adventurous. If you daydream about what it could look like to build a web company that team members and clients want to partner with for decades, we would love to talk with you. We hope you are ready to be a major part of building the culture and creative process here at Gauge. \n  <br>We are based in a modern office in sunny Savannah, GA, but we have remote team members up and down the East Coast. This Account Management position is open to both on-site and remote candidates. \n  <br>Our Team \n  <br>Gauge is a special place, thanks to the dedicated, ambitious, down-to-earth, and geeky people who make up our team. All of us truly invest in the clients and team members we work with. Whether were in the office launching a new site or heading to Forsyth park to play some soccer, each day holds some fun. We want people who share our passion for creativity, business, and technology. \n  <br>Our Clients \n  <br>Our clients are people with dreams, families, and most of all, stories. Many have built their businesses from nothing. They are the salt of the earth and they come from many different industries. We have the pleasure of helping them tell their stories in a powerful, compelling way. If we do our job right, theyll get to hire more people, help more of their customers, and put their kids through college. \n  <br>We dont forget that there are people behind the email addresses we see everyday. They are motivated, interesting, and trusting, and we have built friendships as weve done business over the years. These long-term relationships and creative partnerships add up to make our job incredibly rewarding. \n  <br> \n  <br>Your Position \n  <br>As a Magento Developer, your primary focus will be building and maintaining outstanding eCommerce sites on the Magento platform.

In-depth knowledge and fluency in Magento 2 is a must; experience working with a development team is important. The Gauge dev team works together to solve problems, learn from each other, and build the best products we possibly can. If we were musicians, wed be an orchestra or jam band, not a group of separate rock stars. If thats exciting to you, we want to talk! \n  <br>We have a wide variety of clients from a wide variety of industries. Our services include both big implementations and ongoing maintenance services. Most client communication is channeled through Project &amp; Account Managers, but sometimes youll need to speak directly with clients. The ability to do so in a friendly, accessible, polished way is vital. \n  <br>Were all about learning and growing, so youll be actively involved in both sharing your Magento expertise and learning from your fellow team members. Youll be expected to hone your technical expertise and to build your management and leadership skills over time. We actively support this growth by providing resources, time, and a growth-oriented environment. We promote from within and reward initiative. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Key Tasks &amp; Responsibilities \n  <br> * Work successfully with our team to help our clients grow their businesses \n  <br> * Develop and maintain custom Magento 2 sites, modules, and integrations \n  <br> * Research, install, and configure various Magento 2 Extensions \n  <br> * Actively learn and develop your skills, and help cross-train development team members \n  <br> * Contribute to internal projects and code libraries, develop reusable snippets, and be actively involved in planning \n  <br> * Collaborate with other team members, clients, and partners \n  <br> * Work in a command line environment to perform automated tasks \n  <br> * Update clients about project details during active projects, and help educate clients on the platform and web technology \n  <br> * Develop documentation for code, standards, and workflow \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Benefits \n  <br> \n  <br> * Paid Time Off: (eligible after 60 days) 20 vacation days, 9 predetermined holidays, generous sick leave \n  <br> * Insurance: (eligible after 60 days) United Medical 50% paid by Gauge for employees; Life insurance 100% paid by Gauge for employees; Optional coverage for Dental, Vision, Short-term &amp; Long-term Disability, and Supplemental Insurance; Spouse, dependent, &amp; family coverage available for most options \n  <br> * Retirement: (eligible after 1 year) SimpleIRA with dollar-for-dollar matching funds, up to 3% of annual salary \n  <br> * Growth: A company-wide focus on professional development, including paid certifications and learning initiatives, on-the-clock learning time, company book clubs, and more \n  <br> * Tons of other perks, like open, transparent leadership, no-bull no-politics culture, team social times, awesome equipment, and more \n  <br> \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

    "content": "<h3>PHP Engineer at <span>SkyVerge</span></h3>\n<div>\n <span><i></i> Remote</span> \n</div>\n<div> \n <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>Howdy<br>We’re the folks at SkyVerge, and we build WordPress plugins that help over 100k+ eCommerce businesses grow and manage their WooCommerce stores. <strong>Our team is 100% remote, with 27 people distributed all over the world.</strong></p>\n <p>We’re looking for a driven, experienced, full-stack PHP Engineer to join our growing engineering team and build new features while maintaining our existing portfolio of 60+ individual extensions.</p>\n <p><strong>The Role</strong></p>\n <p>You’ll focus on building new features and maintaining existing code, while also helping with code reviews and customer support. With over 60 different plugins, there’s a wide variety of work. You might spend time on some complicated frontend interactions using JS, then switch focus to working with a tricky external REST API for a while, and later work on adding unit/acceptance tests to our framework code.</p>\n <p>You’ll have the opportunity to really dive into a problem and understand it before crafting a well-engineered, high quality solution. We believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time to think and code.</p>\n <p>Our plugins are built on top of WordPress and designed to work with WooCommerce, so we use PHP 5.3+ (moving soon to PHP 5.6 minimum) and we write all new JS in ES6. We follow a superset of the WordPress coding standards and actively invest in tooling &amp; testing to improve both the quality of our products and the happiness of our team building them.</p>\n <p>We work primarily through GitHub and Slack, so you should be able to clearly express your ideas via comments and messages. All new code is tested and peer-reviewed, so you’ll be able to both learn from the rest of the team and share your knowledge.</p>\n <p>As one of our senior engineers, the team will look to you for advice and direction. You’ll help shape our best practices, decide on libraries &amp; tooling, and refactor older or underperforming parts of the codebase. You’ll also be responsible for moving your projects forward, communicating your progress and milestones with others, and clearly documenting your work.</p>\n <p><strong>Here are some things you may do on a given day:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Research and write a pitch to refactor the data model for our shipping extension</li>\n  <li>Refactor an underperforming class after profiling it in your local environment</li>\n  <li>Troubleshoot an issue with our Memberships plugin by deep-diving into the content restriction class</li>\n  <li>Analyze a slow SQL query and suggest ways to improve it</li>\n  <li>Construct a detailed, multi-step data migration to move data from a custom post type to a custom table, write unit tests for it, and manually user test / QA it.</li>\n  <li>Review a pull request from another team member for readability, maintainability, and adherence to standards, and provide suggested improvements</li>\n  <li>Review new API documentation for one of our integration plugins and draft a story to upgrade to it</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>On the first day you will:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Meet your team and get familiar with how we work</li>\n  <li>Setup your local environment and tooling</li>\n  <li>Commit a small tweak to a plugin and open a pull request for peer review</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>In the first week you will:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Develop, QA, review, and ship a small feature improvement</li>\n  <li>Participate in code review for a teammate’s code</li>\n  <li>Help a team member with fixing a bug</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>In the first month you will:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Work closely with the product team to ship a large feature</li>\n  <li>Participate in your first support rotation week and help our support team with escalated issues</li>\n  <li>Handle deploying a set of plugin releases using our internal tools</li>\n  <li>Publish a retrospective on your first large project to share successes &amp; planned improvements for the next project</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong><br>You</p>\n <p>You love solving engineering challenges in the most pragmatic way possible. You write code that’s clear, readable, and standards-compliant. More importantly, you keep the end user in mind and love getting feedback from customers to help improve our products.</p>\n <p>Finally, you can’t wait to join a small team that loves their work as much as you do, affords the opportunity to work on challenging &amp; interesting projects, continuously learn and improve, and constantly ship your work. You’re an excellent writer and can communicate effectively whether drafting up a bug report, chatting in Slack, editing a wiki page, or drafting a retrospective. You know that code is about communication and explaining your thought process clearly goes hand-in-hand.</p>\n <p>Our team is fully-remote and we communicate primarily through Slack, Clubhouse, Google Docs, Basecamp, and weekly stand-ups via Zoom (a few short meetings) — we believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time that’s free of distractions.</p>\n <p><strong>As a remote team, we believe that regular meetups are invaluable for getting to know each other better, so you should be available for 1-2 company-paid team trips per year. </strong>Curious about what those are like? Check out our recap of our last team retreat (SkyTrip), which brought the entire team out to Scotland for a week! It’s a plus if you think (like we do) that bears are absolutely the coolest animals in the forest.</p>\n <p>This is a <strong>full-time, salaried position</strong>, but hours are flexible. We know your work will speak for itself with commits, issues closed, and wiki edits.</p>\n <p><strong>Process</strong></p>\n <p>After an initial screening, you’ll get an email with a few questions to answer. Following that, you’ll have a few 45 minute phone chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company.</p>\n <p>The most qualified candidates will then be invited to complete a short one-day research project. If this goes well, we’ll invite you to the final stage of our evaluation process: the trial project. During this ~2 week period, you’ll work closely with your future manager, as well as a few other team members, as a paid contractor to implement your proposal from the research project. You’ll be welcomed in Slack, introduced to any team members you may be working with, and will have regular chats with your future manager to share feedback and make sure all is going well.</p>\n <p>Already working full time? Don’t worry! We design the trial project assuming someone already has a full-time job. We won’t ask you to work crazy hours, and we keep your project scoped accordingly. This brief trial period is a great way for you to make sure you enjoy the work and the team, and it also gives us an opportunity to do the same. At the end of the period, assuming a great experience for all, you’ll be offered a full-time position Then the real fun and full onboarding experience will begin!</p>\n <p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Here are some benefits we’re happy to offer to our team members:</li>\n  <li>Competitive salary</li>\n  <li>Annual incentive for meeting team and company goals</li>\n  <li>27 days of paid time-off, in addition to 2 company holidays (SkyVerge Day in March, Founders Day in June)</li>\n  <li>Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance for US and Canadian residents and their families (reimbursements for comparable care for non-US/Canadian residents)</li>\n  <li>401k/RRSP Retirement plan with 4% company match for US/Canadian residents (contributions to comparable plans for non-US/Canadian residents)</li>\n  <li>Up to 8 weeks paid parental leave for new parents</li>\n  <li>Work flexible hours from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection</li>\n  <li>Tools (hardware/software) to help you be productive</li>\n  <li>Allowance for professional growth (books, courses, conferences)</li>\n  <li>Home office or co-working allowance</li>\n  <li>A Kindle to help you keep learning</li>\n </ul>\n <p>We support workplace diversity and do not discriminate on any protected class. We believe when we work together as a team of different views, experiences, and ideas, we can build amazing things.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://skyverge.workable.com/jobs/1070902' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

Rebilly is a Teal Organization, meaning our organizational structure may differ than what you’re used to, but we think you’ll be pleasantly surprised. In a very tiny nutshell, this means that as an organization we value self-management, self-organization, as well as the wholeness of the individuals that make up our team (meaning you should be yourself at work, and do the work that inspires you.)

Rebilly’s comprehensive feature set is built to help our merchants get more of their customers from the order form to the thank you page, and more renewals paid. We took lessons learned from years of experience in the subscription business and millions of subscribers and applied them to make our payment system clever, flexible, and easy to use for our clients.",

We raised a Series A from Stripe and Visa and are a growing team of 77 friends (21 engineers) with a mission to accelerate digital commerce in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</p>\n<p>We're expanding across Africa and have people from as far as Canada, France, and Turkey. We help relocate anyone interested to where our offices are, but we're also determined about remote. Due to rapid growth, half of us are remote today.</p>\n<p>One specific occasion we do require our people to be present at is our quarterly off-site. Four times a year, we fly you in for an extended weekend of jam-packed fun and company-wide check-in, and should you opt for extending your stay a little bit, we host you at our guest house or a sweet hotel. Here’re a few photos from our Q3 offsite (<a href='https://bit.ly/2GkPcZx' rel='nofollow'>https://bit.ly/2GkPcZx</a>)</p>\n<p>We enjoy a close relationship with some of the most interesting technology companies in the world. GitHub CEO Nat Friedman recently swung by our Lagos office (<a href='https://bit.ly/2xLmGLy' rel='nofollow'>https://bit.ly/2xLmGLy</a>) and we also hosted teams from Stripe (<a href='https://bit.ly/2XGxK7m' rel='nofollow'>https://bit.ly/2XGxK7m</a>)</p>\n<p>Our engineering has independent infrastructure, frontend, and (multiple) backend teams that work closely with product, growth, and business. We deploy JavaScript on AWS, data on MySQL, maintain some legacy PHP alongside small Java services.</p>\n<p>We're making great efforts to modularize and improve the quality of our codebases on a quest to embrace asynchronous processing and independent microservices on cloud-agnostic infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We're very proud of our product, and we made a promise to ourselves to make our codebase a thing of envy.</p>\n<p>So here's what we need; people better than us in every way.</p>\n<p>We're a tight bunch of curious people hungry for experienced colleagues to take us to the next level. We crave highly skilled, kind teammates who hold themselves to high standards, and care as fiercely as we do about pursuing collective growth and learning.</p>\n<p>A challenge to build a payments growth engine for an entire continent does not come often. It's an especially interesting time to join Paystack.</p>\n<p>Our hiring is not very conventional and we try to personalize it. We mainly rely on working together on a sample, fictitious project. We'll recognize experience, insatiable curiosity, and an immense passion for sharing.</p>\n<p>My name is Serkan. I myself have joined Paystack only 8 months ago when we were less than 35 people and have been leading engineering for the past 3 months from my home in Turkey. Please don't hesitate to reach me at serkan@paystack.com and let's begin chatting.</p>",
