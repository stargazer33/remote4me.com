Do you have a passion for working with Product Managers to shape and deliver outstanding products for our customers?&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re Bloom &amp; Wild, the UK&rsquo;s most loved online florist. We&rsquo;re using technology to reimagine the experience of buying and receiving flowers, connecting people more thoughtfully to make sending flowers a joy to send and a delight to receive. In doing so we're aiming to become Europe&rsquo;s most loved flower brand. We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;20million in venture capital funding and were recently named as the second-fastest growing tech company in the UK by Deloitte. One of the Tech Nation &ldquo;Future Fifty&rdquo; alumni and one of the Sunday Times Top 100 Small Companies to Work For 2020, we&rsquo;re now the fastest growing online flower company in Europe.</p><br /><p>Our business has, so far, been in the fortunate position to be able to continue trading and growing during this time of economic uncertainty, with the Government actively encouraging online retail, and customer demand for flowers for their loved ones is strong due to social distancing measures in place.</p><br /><p>This is a great opportunity for a Software Engineering Manager with people management experience to lead two cross functional engineering squads. You will report to Steve, our VP Engineering who is extremely passionate about people development and scaling teams. You&rsquo;ll get to shape both people and platforms to support our ambitious growth plans and take part in the next phase of our success.</p><br /><p>In Technology we're split into three squads with a fourth on the way. You'll start by leading the Growth squad, which focuses on driving profitable customer acquisition across all of our markets.&nbsp; This means helping to inspire our customers to understand, find, compare and select their perfect gift as well as working on improvements to our core checkout flow - delightfully expressing our brand to new customers and making it easy to order flowers.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll then play a leading part in the setup and day to day running of our new Expansion squad, with a mission to accelerate growth outside our UK core business. You&rsquo;ll work closely with our VP of Business Development as the squad works on solutions that build our international markets, develop new distribution channels and support the development of new products and services.</p><br /><p><strong>About you</strong></p><br /><p>Building diverse, happy, high performing squads will be a key part of what you do.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We believe strongly in giving our squads autonomy, while using cross team communities of practice and company wide OKRs to ensure alignment. You&rsquo;ll need to be comfortable working at pace, while fostering a mindset of continuous improvement within the squad, evolving and extending the agile, iterative approach to meet the squad&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll play a leading part in delivering the product and technology roadmap, and ensuring that customer needs are at the forefront of the squad members minds. We favour a collaborative, data-driven and experimental approach to solving complex problems, and expect our Engineering Managers to foster this mindset in their squads. You&rsquo;ll ensure that there is a focus on scrum mastery within your squad, either by playing the role yourself or empowering a squad member to assist you.</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll work closely with other Engineering Managers, VP Engineering and community of practice leads to shape the technology roadmap and strategy going forwards, ensuring that we are improving the whole team and optimising the approach for more than just your squad.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Ideally your background will be in frontend development and this will enable you to help your squad interpret requirements into something they can deliver as you work with them to find the right technical approach. Working with our VP Engineering and Technology Leadership team, you&rsquo;ll help to solve our top priority problems for the quarter from a technology and people perspective.</p><br /><p>As an experienced people manager you&rsquo;ll take responsibility for performance management, career progression, pastoral care and everything else that means that you have a happy and motivated squad. The team environment that you create will promote both autonomy and accountability. You&rsquo;ll be a great coach and servant leader, able to motivate and guide the squad through the good times and the bad, learning and improving as you go.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We care about creating a diverse and inclusive team - it's what helps us generate the best ideas and grow faster. We want to make giving and receiving gifts a joy for everyone, and to do this we need people from all backgrounds, with different perspectives and ideas. We welcome anyone to apply, with the knowledge that you&rsquo;ll have the freedom to give your opinion, do your best work and be part of a genuinely inclusive, friendly and caring team.</p><br /><p><strong>Our tech</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll also get to work with some great technology. Our stack consists of iOS and Android apps, an Angular 7 website and backend platform in Ruby on Rails. We encourage our developers to be full stack and our squads to own their code from their local machine into usage in production. We&rsquo;re focusing heavily on increasing our usage of machine learning and automation of our business processes so we can continue to scale at pace.

Working closely with a product designer, the founders and builders to craft high-quality, impactful, and inclusive user experiences for communication experts all around the world.\\n\\nAbout Prezly\\n\\nGood stories, told well to the right people, can inspire and spark positive change in the world. That’s why at Prezly, we’re building state-of-the-art storytelling tools for stellar brands.\\n\\nSince our founding in 2010, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~16 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.\\n\\n\\nAbout the technology\\n\\nOur services are built around a core of PHP (symfony), postgres, React with millions of people per day using some aspect of the system. On the backend side we use a Symfony fork (https://github.com/e1himself/symfony1), Propel (http://propelorm.org/) and interact with a Postgres (RDS) database.\\n\\nWe're big believers in devops/CI - building, testing, and deploying to any of our environments are as simple as pushing a commit to a git branch. The infrastructure is containerised, built on top of AWS using Kubernetes.&nbsp;\\n\\nWe're a technology company first: This means that in addition to product and business development plans, we put emphasis on continual improvement of our stack and infrastructure.

We make high quality products for WordPress.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>The “we” is currently a <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>small team</a> of eight developers, one designer, one marketer, and myself. I’m very proud to say that our little crew has been managing to delight thousands of customers for years.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>In addition to this position, I’m currently in the process of hiring a <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/careers/developer-writer/' rel='nofollow'>Developer Writer</a> with plans for more soon. We have big plans for 2020. Exciting times!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong><br>The Job</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Back in November 2018, we launched a new SaaS product called <a href='https://spinupwp.com/' rel='nofollow'>SpinupWP</a> (a modern cloud-based server control panel designed for WordPress). We launched out of beta in May last year and have been growing steadily ever since. We’ve helped thousands of customers spin up over 11,000 sites, perform over 91,000 site backups, and perform over 1 million tasks!&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Currently, <a href='https://twitter.com/gilbitron' rel='nofollow'>Gilbert</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/A5hleyRich' rel='nofollow'>Ash</a> work full-time on SpinupWP developing and maintaining the app as well as supporting all of our customers. <a href='https://twitter.com/pixels4lyf' rel='nofollow'>Lewis</a>, our in-house designer helps with all things design as well.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>I’m looking for a talented Laravel developer to join Gilbert and Ash to help build new features for SpinupWP as well as help out with support and documentation.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>The app is built using Laravel (PHP) and the front-end is built using Vue.js, so lots of experience with both frameworks and their associated tooling is essential. You’ll also be using Ansible to make sure SpinupWP provisions servers and creates and maintains sites using our <a href='https://spinupwp.com/doc/software-installed-spinupwp-server/' rel='nofollow'>LEMP stack</a> (Nginx, PHP, MySQL, Redis, etc) so sysadmin experience of hosting sites/web apps is also essential.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>We currently work in eight-week cycles with a two-week cooldown period where you can work on whatever you want from the SpinupWP backlog. All of our code is committed to GitHub and your code will be reviewed by Gilbert or Ash using GitHub pull requests. You’ll also be reviewing Gilbert and Ash’s code.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Responsibilities</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><ul><li>Help plan and define the scope of new features</li><li>Build new features using modern PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (Vue) and Ansible</li><li>Work on bug fixes and improvements during each cycle</li><li>Maintain and write new unit and acceptance tests</li><li>Write documentation and in-app copy</li><li>Support our customers via email</li><li>Write articles and tutorials for our blog</li><li>Attend company retreats (see details below)</li></ul><div><strong><br>Requirements</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><ul><li>Expert PHP &amp; JavaScript development skills</li><li>6+ years of advanced PHP development</li><li>6+ years of HTML &amp; CSS development</li><li>6+ years of advanced JavaScript development</li><li>5+ years of project work with Laravel</li><li>3+ years of project work with Vue.js</li><li>1+ years of project work with git as source control</li><li>Sysadmin experience hosting sites/web apps on Nginx, PHP, MySQL, Redis</li><li>Experience writing automated tests</li><li>Excellent English communication skills (spoken and written)</li><li>Work hours in a North America time zone</li><li>Self-motivated and work well independently</li><li>Comfortable working remotely (we don’t have an office)</li></ul><div><strong><br>Nice-to-Have</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><ul><li>Experience with WordPress</li><li>Experience with Ansible</li><li>Experience building and using REST APIs</li><li>UX and design skills</li><li>Open source contributions</li><li>Computer Science degree or equivalent</li></ul><div><strong><br>About You</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>You’re excited about the prospect of <strong>working on the full spectrum of tasks</strong> that are required to build a successful SaaS app. From backend and frontend development, sysadmin, design and UX to documentation and support. You don’t mind wearing multiple hats on any given day.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>You’re <strong>curious and love to learn</strong>. You embrace the opportunity to level up, learn something new and really dig into it. You’re a <strong>disciplined worker</strong> and have no trouble getting work done at home on any given day.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>You value <strong>consistency above preference</strong> and will adopt new coding styles, standards, and tools to that end. You are stellar at identifying the simple, elegant solution in a sea of <strong>over-engineering</strong> possibilities.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Although you often need people to help you generate ideas and formulate a plan of attack on a project, you do your <strong>best work in isolation</strong> without interruption. You’re proactive in tackling things that need to be done <strong>without direction</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>You’re exceptional at communicating in writing via instant message, email, etc. You’re ok on the phone and video chat too. You understand that <strong>clear, concise written communication</strong> is how remote teams thrive. Putting a pull request up for review without explaining its context is unheard of for you.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You own both successes and failures</strong>. When a project you’re leading turns into a disaster, you own it and you learn from it. You never point the finger at others.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You invite criticism</strong> and genuinely want to grow as a professional. You’re onboard with <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/team-pushes-better-developers/' rel='nofollow'>pushing each other to be better</a> and are not afraid to give constructive criticism in addition to receiving it.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Perks</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Location Independent.</strong> Work from wherever you’re happiest, as long as you can make scheduled meetings.</li><li><strong>Choose Your Schedule.</strong> Most companies claim to have flexible hours, but the reality is often very different. We flex our hours for real. As long you’re hitting 30-37.5 hours per week on average and you do what you say you’ll do, we’re good.</li><li><strong>Company Retreats.</strong> As a remote company, it’s super important to get some face time. Last year we met up in <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/berlin-fifth-annual-retreat/' rel='nofollow'>Berlin</a> and we were planning to head to Portugal in June (before a global pandemic struck). Will you be joining us on future retreats?</li><li><strong>Personal Development.</strong> If there’s a conference or event that will help you level up, the company will cover your expenses. You’re also allotted 3 hours per month to learn something new, participate in community discussions, and/or contribute to an open source project.</li><li><strong>Profit Sharing.</strong> I present a Profit &amp; Loss report to the team quarterly so everyone knows how the company is doing. And when the company does well, the team does well.</li><li><strong>Company Holidays.</strong> Things get pretty quiet in late December / early January, so we always treat ourselves to a couple of weeks off to reboot during this time.</li><li><strong>Paid Leave.</strong> For the birth or adoption of a child, the company offers 8 weeks of 100% paid leave for primary caregivers and 3 weeks for secondary caregivers. We also offer 5 paid sick days and 3 days of paid bereavement leave.</li><li><strong>Competitive Salaries.</strong> The company pays salaries that are competitive with the market in which you reside. We don’t use the benefits of remote as leverage to negotiate lower salaries.</li></ul><div><strong><br>Apply</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Fill out the application form: <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/laravel-developer-apply' rel='nofollow'>https://deliciousbrains.com/laravel-developer-apply</a>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>We are an equal opportunity employer. Application information that is prone to unconscious biases is hidden during the review process whenever possible. We judge the content of the applications on their own without knowledge of the applicant’s race, color, gender, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, physical or mental disability, or age. We support workplace diversity, but not at the expense of equal opportunity and meritocracy. We’re looking for talented and empathetic people no matter their other attributes.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>I look forward to reviewing your application.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br>Best of luck,&nbsp;<br><br></div><div></div><div>Brad Touesnard<br>Founder &amp; CEO<br>Delicious Brains Inc.<br><br></div></div>",

Time off is the remedy to a lot of things, and we encourage you to take time off work. Three weeks is the minimum.</div><div><strong><br>Annual Retreats<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We do yearly, week-long retreats and we’d love if you joined us (we pay your way, don’t worry). It’s important to meet each other in person and we value time spent with one another (whether that’s on Slack or face-to-face). We’ve met up all over Europe and islands across South East Asia. All in good fun. Last year we went to Gran Canaria, and this year we’ve been to the south of Italy!</div><div><strong><br>We’re a laid back bunch<br></strong><br><br></div><div>While team retreats sound awesome (and they are), our company ethos is what we value the most.

These are a few of the events that our customers have Curated. We’ve given small business owners around the globe hundreds of thousands of hours back to their families and businesses. And we’d like you to lead our team in St. Louis in finding more businesses to help more deeply.</p><p>Fair warning to all who read...it’s far from a bed of roses. We’ve got product-market fit but we’re still young with life-changing, last-minute opportunities that you’ll be expected to respond to. Then we need you to help us implement processes and policies to handle those last-minute situations better in the future. We expect you to coach a professional team of developers and other coaches while at the same time managing development projects. On top of that, our founder is annoyingly data-driven and will want to understand the data behind your suggestions and proof that they are improvements to our current structure. (Our founder knows we’re looking for a CTO.) We expect you to interrupt and argue with decisions and ideas that you consider flawed, including against the founder. You also accept frank feedback from your reports enthusiastically. You’ll have to be excited when you leave a meeting with technical concessions because, in the long term, you’ll end up helping more small businesses. We’re extremely transparent (most meetings are held here with open doors) and when we talk about our investment into development, your salary is going to be out there. If you’re still reading...</p><p>Why would you want to work here anyways? Because you’ll be leading the charge to bring incredible enterprise tools to small businesses. Because of stories like Whitney Fredin - &nbsp; Because you’ll be able to set the vision for our development organization including all aspects of software development, security, deployment, as well as the reliability of the product and supporting internal applications. Because you’ll get to be involved in deep strategic conversations about SaaS economics and a sales funnel. Because you’ll get to be involved in all the messiness of a startup and be able to take ownership of projects that nobody even thought about out.

We’re friendly and flexible. And we totally understand if you come complete with kids, pets, side-hustles, and other #adulting stuff.**All about you****You say ‘yes’ to CSS.** And HTML. You don’t brag about it, but you’ve received plenty of compliments for your semantic markup and CSS skills.**You Wordpress with finesse.** Some people make an awful mess when they write code for the ‘press. This isn’t you. You’re an artisan. You write code with elegance. And you’ve got years of exquisite, custom Wordpress builds to back it up.**Design could be your dirty secret.** While you’re great at coding the things, your passion is for making them stunning. **You’ve got the skills.** In PHP and Javascript, that is. And if you haven’t already, you’re into learning Typescript.**You’re a Git.** But, in a good way. You’ve used Git and Github so much that it feels like a second home.**You know what AWS is.** And you’ve probably deployed Wordpress on it. If you haven’t, you’re open to learning.**You’re most of the above.** But not necessarily all. You can feel in your tummy if this is the right job for you.**You’re committed to learning.** You love filling your head with new stuff and taking on new projects that expand your horizons.**All about the role****You’ll manage your own schedule.** While you’ll need to maintain regular work hours (for the benefit of your team), you’ll be free to lay your day out the way you like it. Need to get the kids from school or take your granny to the shops? No problem. And you can work from wherever you want, be that your kitchen or one of our offices.**You’ll play a valuable role.** You’ll lead on code for the Biteable Wordpress site. You’ll work closely with our product designers to synchronize design with our product site.**You’ll work collaboratively with the marketing and content teams.** Together, you’ll roll out content and functionalities that wow users and boost conversions.**You’ll share code ownership with your playmates in the development team.** Together, you’ll maintain a robust code review process and troubleshoot any thorny issues that crop up from time-to-time.**All about us**We are Biteable, a tech start-up that makes (jaw-dropping) videos possible for everyone. We stand apart in our market thanks to our dedication to studio-quality content and our passion for simplicity.Since our launch in 2014 we’ve:* Created a community of over 6 million users* Rendered more than 10 million videos* Raised $3.9 million in venture capitalWe’re growing fast and have offices in Melbourne and Hobart, Australia, with remote team members scattered around the world. We are informal, structurally flat, and fun to work with.**All about our culture**We are committed to the happiness of our team. We welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We like it when everyone feels supported and free to create.Our team members genuinely care about each other and define themselves as rigorous, respectful, open, supportive, honest, and egoless. Here are a few quotes that we didn’t make up:_“I’m thankful for the flexibility Biteable gives me around my family commitments. I really like that my team is open to new ideas and processes. And I enjoy that I get to work on a variety of problems with a mix of people with diverse areas of expertise.”__“The development team is a great group of people. They’re smart and interested in doing high-quality work, but foster a social and supportive atmosphere, too.”__“Biteable's team of smart, funny, engaged and caring people makes my work here enjoyable, every day. Being close to decisions and decision-makers helps me make an impact on our work.”_**How to apply**We want you to start soon, so our application process is quick. To apply, dispatch your CV, portfolio, and a short cover letter about why you and Biteable fit together like Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little.We’ll review it and get back to you quick smart. We’ll then do two rounds of informal interviews.

    "content": "<h3> Wordpress Developer </h3><div><div><br>Hi-de-ho stranger. Biteable here. Let’s not be strangers. We need a fabulous new someone in our life to write Wordpress code and make our site ba-ba-beautiful. We’re friendly and flexible. And we totally understand if you come complete with kids, pets, side-hustles, and other #adulting stuff.<br><br></div><div><strong>All about you</strong></div><div><strong><br>You say ‘yes’ to CSS.</strong> And HTML. You don’t brag about it, but you’ve received plenty of compliments for your semantic markup and CSS skills.</div><div><strong><br>You Wordpress with finesse.</strong> Some people make an awful mess when they write code for the ‘press. This isn’t you. You’re an artisan. You write code with elegance. And you’ve got years of exquisite, custom Wordpress builds to back it up.<br><br></div><div><strong>Design could be your dirty secret.</strong> While you’re great at coding the things, your passion is for making them stunning.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>You’ve got the skills.</strong> In PHP and Javascript, that is. And if you haven’t already, you’re into learning Typescript.</div><div><strong><br>You’re a Git.</strong> But, in a good way. You’ve used Git and Github so much that it feels like a second home.</div><div><strong><br>You know what AWS is.</strong> And you’ve probably deployed Wordpress on it. If you haven’t, you’re open to learning.<br><br></div><div><strong>You’re most of the above.</strong> But not necessarily all. You can feel in your tummy if this is the right job for you.</div><div><strong><br>You’re committed to learning.</strong> You love filling your head with new stuff and taking on new projects that expand your horizons.</div><div><strong><br>All about the role</strong></div><div><strong><br>You’ll manage your own schedule.</strong> While you’ll need to maintain regular work hours (for the benefit of your team), you’ll be free to lay your day out the way you like it.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Need to get the kids from school or take your granny to the shops? No problem. And you can work from wherever you want, be that your kitchen or one of our offices.</div><div><strong><br>You’ll play a valuable role.</strong> You’ll lead on code for the Biteable Wordpress site. You’ll work closely with our product designers to synchronize design with our product site.</div><div><strong><br>You’ll work collaboratively with the marketing and content teams.</strong> Together, you’ll roll out content and functionalities that wow users and boost conversions.</div><div><strong><br>You’ll share code ownership with your playmates in the development team.</strong> Together, you’ll maintain a robust code review process and troubleshoot any thorny issues that crop up from time-to-time.<br><br></div><div><strong>All about us</strong></div><div><br>We are Biteable, a tech start-up that makes (jaw-dropping) videos possible for everyone. We stand apart in our market thanks to our dedication to studio-quality content and our passion for simplicity.<br><br></div><div>Since our launch in 2014 we’ve:</div><ul><li>Created a community of over 6 million users</li><li>Rendered more than 10 million videos</li><li>Raised $3.9 million in venture capital</li></ul><div>We’re growing fast and have offices in Melbourne and Hobart, Australia, with remote team members scattered around the world. We are informal, structurally flat, and fun to work with.</div><div><strong><br>All about our culture</strong></div><div><br>We are committed to the happiness of our team. We welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We like it when everyone feels supported and free to create.</div><div><br>Our team members genuinely care about each other and define themselves as rigorous, respectful, open, supportive, honest, and egoless. Here are a few quotes that we didn’t make up:</div><div><em><br>“I’m thankful for the flexibility Biteable gives me around my family commitments. I really like that my team is open to new ideas and processes. And I enjoy that I get to work on a variety of problems with a mix of people with diverse areas of expertise.”</em></div><div><em><br>“The development team is a great group of people. They’re smart and interested in doing high-quality work, but foster a social and supportive atmosphere, too.”</em></div><div><em><br>“Biteable's team of smart, funny, engaged and caring people makes my work here enjoyable, every day. Being close to decisions and decision-makers helps me make an impact on our work.”</em></div><div><strong><br>How to apply<br></strong><br></div><div>We want you to start soon, so our application process is quick. To apply, dispatch your CV, portfolio, and a short cover letter about why you and Biteable fit together like Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little.</div><div><br>We’ll review it and get back to you quick smart. We’ll then do two rounds of informal interviews. If it feels right for all of us, you’ll be on board faster than you can say ‘third-party plugin’.<br><br></div><div>Send your application to jobs.0105201@biteable.com</div><div><strong><br>Please do not contact us if you are an agency or a recruiter<br></strong><br></div><div><br><br></div></div>",

We’ve had some great developers, but never a true leader of all things tech because it hasn’t been necessary. However, now it is. And I’m looking for a true needle-in-a-haystack to sprint along side me as we execute on our next growth leg.Our mission at Metabolic Living is to make our metabolism-first lifestyle the worldwide standard for healthy living. Even without the current pandemic, people struggle with their health, confused by so many competing options that don’t get results. So, we’ve developed a simple process anybody can follow to optimize their metabolism to deliver the energy their body needs to thrive.**We run on a LAMP stack on AWS, have a team of 3 developers (100+ people in company) and now need a senior tech leader to help us achieve our next growth target of $100MM and beyond. You have the opportunity to build out the perfect team the way YOU see fit. We do not yet have a mobile technical strategy in place, so this is an opportunity for you to define that as well.**The ideal candidate is both a high-caliber, full-stack developer and systems architect who loves to code, as well as a fantastic manager who is very marketing- and consumer-oriented and business-savvy. We only want someone who has been there and done that as we have lots of wood to chop on the business end. We need to rely on a steady proven rock as leader of all things tech to get things done.And it’s a HUGE plus if you’re passionate about health and wellness :-)Yes, we know we’re asking for someone unique, but we’re putting this out there anyway to find the right candidate, with a robust compensation package to reflect this unique challenge. If you’re interested, you’ll find the full story of our company below – we’re only interested in talking to people who are inspired by this and want to be a part of this amazing journey we’re on.In spite of the crisis the world is in, we’re thriving, and in fact growing, because of the products and services we sell. **Our goal is to build a $1 billion dollar consumer brand by 2023 and technology will play an enormously important role in achieving that.** We’re just putting the finishing touches on our re-branding efforts (more on that below) and will be launching our flagship e-commerce website in 2-3 months. That will be followed by a robust app that simplifies everything for consumers this Fall.**We’re particularly excited about the app as it will be the future of the company** as we integrate our propriety Metabolic OS and automate customized meal plans, workouts and lifestyle changes that truly reflect the uniqueness of each individual. And how that uniqueness changes over time in response to changes in your physiology, psychology, preferences and other lifestyle factors.**If you’re a proven tech leader who knows how to both build and manage a team in a fast-moving environment and is a truly high-caliber end-to-end full stack web and mobile developer and…**You LOVE to build things to perfection, but know how to iterate rapidly to gain traction…You LOVE working on consumer-facing websites, applications and architectureYou LOVE everything e-commerce-related and have deep experience in payments…You LOVE building apps with the right tech so things “just work” flawlessly…You LOVE to think, solve complex problems and get a rush when your builds go live…Then please read on as you’re the ideal candidate… and we’d love to talk to you ASAP.**To summarize the key points:**- **Salary**: $150,000 - $250,000- **Location**: 100% Remote (virtual team of 100+ with no corporate office)- **Benefits**: Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k- **Hours**: 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. (preferably Eastern time but flexible for right candidate)- **Culture**: High-Performance but Humble (no jerks) that Creates Space for Deep Work- **Personality**: Obsessed with Details so We can Simplify the Complex for Others**Who is This Opportunity Perfect for?**This is the perfect opportunity for a tech leader who loves to roll up their sleeves and code, enjoys building teams and who has an unstoppable drive for excellence and might relate to any of these:**If you’re drowning in the corporate or agency world,** suffocating from lack of clarity, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get work done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep – to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity… and scale it like never before.**Or, if you’ve tried the freelance thing,** but found it challenging or simply not fun doing the sales and marketing piece to land new clients so you could provide yourself or your family with a steady income, this is your opportunity find a long-term home with an organization who cares and who will constantly put fun, meaningful and challenging projects on your plate to keep things exciting and interesting.**Or, if you’ve been at a fast-growing start-up,** but they haven’t turned the corner and learned how to grow without the stress, how to deliver results without working past 5 p.m., how to not burn the candle at both ends, how to create a profitable business model that doesn’t depend on the whims of VC or PE world to provide the next round of funding… this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction.Regardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day… AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we can’t wait to meet you.**Who Are We and What’s the Company’s Background?**Metabolic Living’s mission is to empower people to thrive EVERY day so they can enjoy life to the fullest. And our vision is to do this by making our metabolism-first lifestyle become the worldwide standard for healthy living. It’s a flexible, fun lifestyle that’s 100% focused on delivering the results that matter: feeling your best, looking your best and performing your best. In the shortest time possible.It puts YOU back in control. It helps YOU understand how your body and metabolism works. It empowers YOU to fix your own problems. And because it alleviates the frustration and confusion so many of us experience when trying to fix our health, it makes you want to tell the world about it.Our goal is to grow into a billion-dollar multi-channel brand that’s distributed via online, mobile and physical retail. For 10 years, we’ve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework, team and culture to make this happen. We have a robust, mature, complete and profitable business model with scalable customer acquisition. And now we’re pushing into a massive new growth phase.We’ve built a full ecosystem of products that allow someone to live a metabolism-first lifestyle. This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods, memberships and coaching programs. We’re launching our mobile app later this year, then will push into offline retail, extend into home-delivered meals and more. But ONE thing at a time, just like we’ve done for 9 years.Our next major step is rolling out our new Metabolic Living brand and centralized e-commerce website at www.metabolicliving.com, scheduled to be live in first half of 2020. We will consolidate into this centralized website our various product-branded microsites.**So why is a metabolism-first lifestyle needed?** Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up around the world. We’re over-worked, over-stressed, over-fed and full of toxins. And we’re deprived of the sleep, nutrition, movement and relaxation we need to thrive.Unfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise traps people into a 1-step-forward, 2-steps back vicious cycle that makes them worse off. They bounce from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making progress… trapped in a downward spiral of increasing desperation.And philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create a rigid us-vs-them tribal mentality that’s self-limiting. Neither of those philosophies work for all people all the time… or even the same person all the time. People differ. Bodies change. If that’s not respected, things will backfire.**The answer?** Instead of trying to FIND the perfect program, you need to CREATE their own – one that respects how YOUR body works. And that’s where our metabolism-first framework comes in.It empowers you with a repeatable, customizable method to optimize your metabolism. Because we’ve found through working with millions of people that a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results everyone wants – feeling their best, looking their best and performing their best, EVERY day.So, instead of fighting against your body and getting inconsistent results with a one-size fits all program or protocol, we teach you to work with your body to enjoy consistent results by building your OWN perfect customized program. One that’s practical, enjoyable and sustainable… and starts working fast.**Requirements****What Are the Major Objectives?**- **Build Out Team** – Recruit, train and manage a high-performing tech team who seamless delivers against the company’s objectives while ensuring sufficient cross-training to be resilient- **Launch e-Comm** – Finish launching our new centralized e-commerce website at www.metabolicliving.com, which is 75% completed and ready for the final push- **Build App** – Create a state-of-the-art app that translates our metabolic optimization process into an easy-to-follow consumer-friendly experience that helps people get results- **Manage Team to Hit KPIs** – Coach each member of the team to create aggressive, yet achievable quarterly KPIs** that create a competitive, yet collaborative culture that’s fun- **Build Systems and SOPs** – Establish uniformity through the development of SOPs, workflows and other systems so your team operates efficiently and effectively**What Are the On-going Responsibilities?**- **Strategy** – Work with our product and marketing team to establish the overall vision and strategy to ensure our technology solutions deliver what’s best for the consumer- **Analysis** – Dive DEEP into usage data for our properties and apps to pinpoint areas of technical optimization to make everything run smoother, faster and better- **Coding** – Own whatever part of the stack makes sense for you to own based on your assessment of the team’s abilities, whether database layer, application layer, front-end, architecture, etc.- **Project Management **– You’ll be the single point of accountability for all major strategic projects, conducting daily huddles, building requirements and managing project plans**What Key Skills and Experience are Needed?**- **10+ Technical Management** – Building, leading and managing tech teams who can consistently deliver on time, on spec and on budget in a collaborative, inspiring way- **7+ Years Full-Stack LAMP Experience** – Excels in every portion of dev and coding, whether database layer, application layer, front-end or anything in between in a LAMP stack- **5+ Years Mobile / App Experience** – Building and optimizing high-volume, consumer-facing apps on both iOS and Android with deep technical expertise to create mobile vision and strategy- **3+ Years E-commerce Expertise** – Heavy exposure e-commerce from building shopping carts to integrating payment processing to fulfillment, logistics and everything in between- **AWS / Cloud Architect** – Robust experience managing all facets of AWS, including Cloudfront, S3, EC2, ELB, IAM, RDS, and Autoscaling- **Heavy Marketing-Systems Focus – With deep experience in A/B split testing, funnel development, analytics, page speed optimization, API integrations, etc.- **Systems Architecture** – Deep experience architecting systems that are scalable, resilient and secure within an environment of high volume data**Unquenchable Curiosity** – It’s impossible for you to stop asking why, why, why… or what if, what if, what if… and you get very antsy, almost to the point of impatience, for the next test- **Data-Driven** – Extremely comfortable flexing the analytical side of your brain with a passionate for pouring through reams of response data to detect patterns of success to replicate- **Systems-Oriented** – You’ve got strong organizational skills and love to create order out of chaos with highly organized systems that deliver sustained success, regardless of who is in charge- **Excellent Communicator** – Able to clearly and concisely articulate positions both in written format and orally in 1-on-1 or group situations that build cohesion and gain alignment**Benefits****What You'll Enjoy from Us:**- **A Curated Team** - A very supportive team of other high-performers who like to get things done, hold themselves accountable and help each other out wherever possible.- **A Nurturing Culture** - A culture that supports and nurtures your need to learn, grow and -challenge yourself to be the best you possibly can be.- **A Fantastic Lifestyle** – A 100% remote experience that allows you to work from home, enjoy your family, outside interests and passions- **A Robust Benefits Package** -- Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k + 15 days PTO and additional perks as we add them",

We focus on hiring people who, first and foremost, share the passion of our mission and our customers, and who have an unequivocal commitment to excellence, hard work, and love of neighbor. We also insist on supporting every team member’s personal priorities, recognizing that our work is not often the most important thing in each of our lives. And that only when a person’s work at Flocknote aligns in some way with their own personal dreams will they be truly happy and most productive.&nbsp;</p><p>We manage our team based on good personal relationships, offering flexible schedules and a 35 hour work week, allowing people to put family first, understanding each other, and holding frequent one-on-one meetings between all levels of management and each team member. Though we are a remote company, we make in-person team gatherings a top priority. Our in-person gatherings include a little work, team service projects, live interactions with customers, and of course a little fun, too (including beach houses, axe throwing, escape rooms and more!). We also make it a point to have virtual parties throughout the year celebrating various holidays, such as Halloween, Christmas, and even National Donut Day.&nbsp;</p><p>Central to our culture, we are each committed to growing in our 10 governing virtues each day and allowing them to govern our work and relationships. Our 10 governing virtues are: Humility, Veracity, Patience, Courage, Justice, Wisdom, Temperance, Faith, Hope, and Love. At every weekly team meeting, we assign a different team member to share a reflection (typically a quote or story) on one of our governing virtues.</p><p>Ultimately, we are not just coworkers, but friends, who truly care for one another and help each other to be successful and happy.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>35 hour work week</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible work schedules</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical/dental/vision benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Choice of the specific tech equipment you use (e.g., PC or Mac)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>4 weeks vacation + up to 18 company days off per year</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salaries</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Maternity and Paternity leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We put family first</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

This is a remote, full-time position.</p><p>CLIENT COMPANY DESCRIPTION:<br>The client company is a membership organisation which provides country sports insurance and other benefits to members in the UK and Ireland. The company and its first club were established in 2008 and sister club was launched in 2017. They are looking to streamline the purchase process and improve overall user experience to encourage new members and maintain existing members. They also want to improve their search rankings by ensuring the new site is optimised to help potential customers find them, and relevant information about their products, quickly and easily.<br><br>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:<br>You will be tasked with developing two new websites from scratch (and potentially maintain them in the future)<br><br>Both websites are for clubs which require a membership database, members area with login, e-commerce and an admin control panel to manage memberships / purchases etc. There are various referral forms and a member’s benefits page which needs to have an interface for Trade Associates to upload details of special offers to members - this needs an approval system. There are lots more unique elements which require additional features for specific types of memberships/sales and, although functionality is broadly similar across the two sites, the second club also requires some extra functionality not required in the first.<br><br>Features they do not currently have and would like to introduce include optional recurring / automated renewal and payments, means to purchase multiple memberships in a single transaction, claims forms and claims management in the admin panel, ability to attach uploaded files to a member's record, ability to create custom reports and many more minor tweaks.<br><br>The current websites have been built (and built upon) by their in-house web developer. As the company has grown, requirements and systems have changed and the existing database and code is no longer fit for their purpose. They require a full structural review of the database and rebuilding from the ground up to ensure everything is fully cohesive. Existing membership data will need to be migrated into the new database and systems.<br><br>Once the new sites are finished and launched the client will require ongoing maintenance and updates.<br><br>RELATIONSHIPS - WHO YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH:<br>You will be reporting to the Managing Director and consulting with existing in house developer (and potentially another freelance developer) as needed. The client is in the Europe/London (+00:00) GMT time zone.<br><br>REQUIRED SKILLS:<br>- Strong English Communication<br>- PHP (Laravel or Symfony experience strongly preferred)<br>- JavaScript<br>- HTML<br>- CSS<br>- MySQL<br>- Server Configuration and Management in AWS<br>- Git<br><br>DESIRED (NICE-TO-HAVE) SKILLS:<br>- Experience with a modern JavaScript framework like React, Angular or Vue)<br>- Payment Gateway Integration experience<br><br>START DATE:<br>March 16, 2020<br><br>EXPECTED CONTRACT DURATION:<br>About 6 months but this is flexible. Ongoing maintenance thereafter.<br><br>NOTES:<br>The client is open to someone who can start part-time, but with a transition to full-time.</p><p>HOURLY RATE:</p><p>The pay rate for this role is from $30 to $50 USD per hour, depending on experience and capability.</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

You don’t mind wearing multiple hats on any given day.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You’re <strong>curious and love to learn</strong>. You embrace the opportunity to level up, learn something new and really dig into it. You’re a <strong>disciplined worker</strong> and have no trouble getting work done at home on any given day.&nbsp;</div><div><br>You value <strong>consistency above preference</strong> and will adopt new coding styles, standards, and tools to that end. You are stellar at identifying the simple, elegant solution in a sea of <strong>over-engineering</strong> possibilities.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Although you often need people to help you generate ideas and formulate a plan of attack on a project, you do your <strong>best work in isolation</strong> without interruption. You’re proactive in tackling things that need to be done <strong>without direction</strong>.&nbsp;</div><div><br>You’re exceptional at communicating in writing via instant message, email, etc. You’re ok on the phone and video chat too. You understand that <strong>clear, concise written communication</strong> is how remote teams thrive. Putting a pull request up for review without explaining its context is unheard of for you.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>You own both successes and failures</strong>. When a project you’re leading turns into a disaster, you own it and you learn from it. You never point the finger at others.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>You invite criticism</strong> and genuinely want to grow as a professional. You’re onboard with <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/team-pushes-better-developers/' rel='nofollow'>pushing each other to be better</a> and are not afraid to give constructive criticism in addition to receiving it.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Perks</strong>&nbsp;</div><ul><li><strong>Location Independent.</strong> Work from wherever you’re happiest, as long as you can make scheduled meetings.</li><li><strong>Choose Your Schedule.</strong> Most companies claim to have flexible hours, but the reality is often very different. We flex our hours for real. As long you’re hitting 30-37.5 hours per week on average and you do what you say you’ll do, we’re good.</li><li><strong>Company Retreats.</strong> As a remote company, it’s super important to get some face time. Last year we met up in <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/berlin-fifth-annual-retreat/' rel='nofollow'>Berlin</a> and we’re headed to Portugal in June. Will you be joining us?</li><li><strong>Personal Development.</strong> If there’s a conference or event that will help you level up, the company will cover your expenses. You’re also allotted 3 hours per month to learn something new, participate in community discussions, and/or contribute to an open source project.</li><li><strong>Profit Sharing.</strong> I present a Profit &amp; Loss report to the team quarterly so everyone knows how the company is doing. And when the company does well, the team does well.</li><li><strong>Company Holidays.</strong> Things get pretty quiet in late December / early January, so we always treat ourselves to a couple of weeks off to reboot during this time.</li><li><strong>Paid Leave.</strong> For the birth or adoption of a child, the company offers 8 weeks of 100% paid leave for primary caregivers and 3 weeks for secondary caregivers. We also offer 5 paid sick days and 3 days of paid bereavement leave.</li><li><strong>Competitive Salaries.</strong> The company pays salaries that are competitive with the market in which you reside. We don’t use the benefits of remote as leverage to negotiate lower salaries.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Apply</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Fill out the application form: <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/laravel-developer-apply' rel='nofollow'>https://deliciousbrains.com/laravel-developer-apply</a>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer.

Do you have a passion for working with Product Managers to shape and deliver outstanding products for our customers?&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re Bloom &amp; Wild, the UK&rsquo;s most loved online florist. We&rsquo;re using technology to reimagine the experience of buying and receiving flowers, connecting people more thoughtfully to make sending flowers a joy to send and a delight to receive. In doing so we're aiming to become Europe&rsquo;s most loved flower brand. We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;20million in venture capital funding and were recently named as the second-fastest growing tech company in the UK by Deloitte. One of the Tech Nation &ldquo;Future Fifty&rdquo; alumni and one of the Sunday Times Top 100 Small Companies to Work For 2020, we&rsquo;re now the fastest growing online flower company in Europe.</p><br /><p>Our business has, so far, been in the fortunate position to be able to continue trading and growing during this time of economic uncertainty, with the Government actively encouraging online retail, and customer demand for flowers for their loved ones is strong due to social distancing measures in place.</p><br /><p>This is a great opportunity for a Software Engineering Manager with people management experience to lead two cross functional engineering squads. You will report to Steve, our VP Engineering who is extremely passionate about people development and scaling teams. You&rsquo;ll get to shape both people and platforms to support our ambitious growth plans and take part in the next phase of our success.</p><br /><p>In Technology we're split into three squads with a fourth on the way. You'll start by leading the Growth squad, which focuses on driving profitable customer acquisition across all of our markets.&nbsp; This means helping to inspire our customers to understand, find, compare and select their perfect gift as well as working on improvements to our core checkout flow - delightfully expressing our brand to new customers and making it easy to order flowers.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll then play a leading part in the setup and day to day running of our new Expansion squad, with a mission to accelerate growth outside our UK core business. You&rsquo;ll work closely with our VP of Business Development as the squad works on solutions that build our international markets, develop new distribution channels and support the development of new products and services.</p><br /><p><strong>About you</strong></p><br /><p>Building diverse, happy, high performing squads will be a key part of what you do.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We believe strongly in giving our squads autonomy, while using cross team communities of practice and company wide OKRs to ensure alignment. You&rsquo;ll need to be comfortable working at pace, while fostering a mindset of continuous improvement within the squad, evolving and extending the agile, iterative approach to meet the squad&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll play a leading part in delivering the product and technology roadmap, and ensuring that customer needs are at the forefront of the squad members minds. We favour a collaborative, data-driven and experimental approach to solving complex problems, and expect our Engineering Managers to foster this mindset in their squads. You&rsquo;ll ensure that there is a focus on scrum mastery within your squad, either by playing the role yourself or empowering a squad member to assist you.</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll work closely with other Engineering Managers, VP Engineering and community of practice leads to shape the technology roadmap and strategy going forwards, ensuring that we are improving the whole team and optimising the approach for more than just your squad.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Ideally your background will be in frontend development and this will enable you to help your squad interpret requirements into something they can deliver as you work with them to find the right technical approach. Working with our VP Engineering and Technology Leadership team, you&rsquo;ll help to solve our top priority problems for the quarter from a technology and people perspective.</p><br /><p>As an experienced people manager you&rsquo;ll take responsibility for performance management, career progression, pastoral care and everything else that means that you have a happy and motivated squad. The team environment that you create will promote both autonomy and accountability. You&rsquo;ll be a great coach and servant leader, able to motivate and guide the squad through the good times and the bad, learning and improving as you go.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We care about creating a diverse and inclusive team - it's what helps us generate the best ideas and grow faster. We want to make giving and receiving gifts a joy for everyone, and to do this we need people from all backgrounds, with different perspectives and ideas. We welcome anyone to apply, with the knowledge that you&rsquo;ll have the freedom to give your opinion, do your best work and be part of a genuinely inclusive, friendly and caring team.</p><br /><p><strong>Our tech</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll also get to work with some great technology. Our stack consists of iOS and Android apps, an Angular 7 website and backend platform in Ruby on Rails. We encourage our developers to be full stack and our squads to own their code from their local machine into usage in production. We&rsquo;re focusing heavily on increasing our usage of machine learning and automation of our business processes so we can continue to scale at pace.

    "content": "Attention Senior Backend Developers:“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”You’ve finally found it…The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!But only if you keep reading.iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School1 - Solve Interesting ProblemsMost of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.2 - Work With A Clean CodebaseTell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”We don’t work like that.We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.3 - Endless Opportunities To GrowYou love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.We get how important growth is for developers.Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.4 - Get Expert GuidanceOur developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own TimeHave you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.6 - Work From Anywhere In The WorldWe understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.7 - Stability You Can Count OnMost startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue.

Due to automatization of disinformation search, the platform not only saves 3-4 hours per day per journalist, but also solves one of the largest issues in countering disinformation - which is timely reaction: in case a large, potentially harmful campaign is detected, the system automatically notifies journalists to debunk it before the story went viral and the consequences became irreversible. Since the inception of Debunk EU, the journalists have debunked over 200 disinformation campaigns detected by the platform which were read more than 13 million times.</p><p>Debunk.eu was invited to present its work in17 countries in over 70 events&nbsp;including Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Austria, Belgium, France, Georgia, Italy, The Netherlands, Serbia, Slovakia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom, North Macedonia and The United States.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Challenging and groundbreaking projects that disrupt the market</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>No strict hierarchy - we are always glad to hear your insights</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>No stress for mistakes - lear through experiments and brainstorming</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Growth with us</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>A great team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>International traveling, events, media</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
