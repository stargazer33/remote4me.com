You'll be working on eCommerce platforms and CMSes like Magento, Shopify and WordPress. The core technologies you'll be working with are PHP, HTML, CSS, and JS.\\n\\nOur projects are generally focused around making large, material changes to our clients' sites or designing and developing new sites from the ground up. You work closely with client stakeholders, our project managers, and other developers to design, develop and deploy features and updates that *best serve our clients and their customers*.\\n\\nWe have quite a bit of work booked for the next few months, so an ideal applicant will be ready to hit the ground running. Despite the amount of work we have, I strive to minimize context switching—if you're on a project, you shouldn't expect to be bombarded with unrelated tweaks on other projects here and there.\\n\\nWe're a small but quickly growing agency. As one of the early hires, there is opportunity for this to be a high impact position. An appropriately ambitious individual will have huge opportunity to lay the groundwork of the company's future.\\n\\n## About BranchLabs\\n\\nBranchLabs is a small but rapidly growing fully remote eCommerce consultancy. We provide eCommerce strategy, design, and implementation services for our clients. Our clients are generally vertically integrated, branded B2C businesses. We help them sell more online, show their brand in the best light, and optimize their backend eCommerce processes.\\n\\nOur reputation is built on delivering results. We take pride in the work we produce. The products we deliver are high quality inside and out, and they help our clients capitalize on real opportunities. We work closely with stakeholders on our clients' marketing teams, combining their understanding of their customers with our understanding of all things eCommerce. Together, we craft solutions that work for our clients and their customers.\\n\\n## Some Notes on Culture\\n\\nHere are some of our values. They're always being refined based on what works and what doesn't.\\n\\n* We value clear, concise communication.\\n* You can only produce high quality work if you have a clear understanding of the problem.\\n* Context—understanding our clients and their customers—empowers individual contributors to find better solutions.\\n* Free up time for interesting problems by automating repeatable tasks and learning your tools inside and out.\\n* No process for process' sake. No meetings for meetings' sake. But there *is* a place for both.\\n* Build or use tools to provide predictability and eliminate boring work.\\n* Individual productivity is important to us, and it is hugely dependent on a minimally distracting, supportive environment.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n When you start, this is what you can expect to work on.\\n\\n* Full Magento, Shopify, or WooCommerce site development\\n* Design architecture, then implement features for existing eCommerce stores\\n* Implement designs in CSS/HTML/JS\\n* Configure middleware services like Redis, Memcached, Varnish, Solr, ElasticSearch, etc.\\n* Integrate with 3rd party APIs \\n\\n# Requirements\\n## Qualifications\\n\\nThese are the must haves. Basically: be a web developer!\\n\\n* 3–5+ years of industry experience\\n* Hands-on programming experience with Magento, Shopify or WooCommerce\\n* Proficient in HTML, CSS, and JS\\n* Git experience\\n* Understand the web—REST, HTTP verbs, basic HTTP status codes, etc.\\n* Familiarity with the Unix command line\\n\\n## Ideal Qualifications\\n\\nIf you fulfill the above *and* have experience with a few of the below, definitely get in touch.\\n\\n* Hands-on programming experience with all three of the core eCommerce platforms we support\\n* Enterprise software development\\n* Strong UX/UI chops\\n* Deep understanding building complex database queries, particularly MySQL\\n* Experience setting up and configuring Apache\\n* Opinionated about design—visual and code\\n* A portfolio of personal projects (not necessarily code related) \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world and provide skills that will enhance our business intelligence system to help us make better decisions.\\n\\nWe’ll teach you the ins and outs of the online business brokerage industry, coming from years of experience. You’ll work on improving the customer journey, which should be flawless, pain free and easy to navigate. For many of our customers it is the first time either buying or selling an online business, which can be an incredibly anxious and confusing moment in their lives. You’ll be helping them directly by providing them with an easy to use interface that just makes sense.\\nThe Senior Full Stack Engineer position is vital to the success of our company, partnering with all departments to align technology strategy with the company’s objectives.\\n\\nOur small and close knit engineering team currently consists of a UX specialist, 2 frontend engineers, one backend engineer, one WordPress engineer and several QA specialists. You’ll work closely with the team to implement solutions for all departments within Empire Flippers, be it compliance, customer support, sales and migrations. Additional responsibilities could lead to supervising our engineering team.\\n\\nThis is a full time position – our company is growing at a fast rate, which means excellent opportunities for personal and career growth. We may ask you to attend conferences too, which can help you network with industry leaders.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n You’ll take on the challenge of improving the overall efficiency of Empire Flippers by developing fully fledged platforms, ensuring both the user experience and functionality are elevated to unprecedented levels. You’ll be responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment building high quality, architecturally sound systems. You will use your initiative to design and implement client-side and server-side architecture, as well as implement API’s and integrations that address our business needs. Both our clients and staff will be using the software you write and you’ll be responsible for monitoring system performance and configuring new software and hardware. \\n\\n# Requirements\\nYou must have a passion for travel, ideally with long periods of digital nomad experience with travel outside your home country.\\n\\nYou should have at least 5 good years of full stack experience under your belt, having implemented some complex, data driven applications. Your portfolio speaks louder than your words.\\n\\nYou should have team-lead or management experience with a remote team.\\n\\nAn in-depth understanding of database management systems, both relational and non-relational databases.\\n\\nHands on experience in IT, computer systems engineering, or systems engineering and analysis is necessary.\\n\\nYou should have an ability to conduct technological analyses and research, with a solid understanding of technological trends to build strategy.\\n\\nYou should be a ninja with every component of our tech stack. You must have a complete working knowledge of Ruby on Rails, SQL, Postgres, Sidekiq, Rspec, Git, Redis.\\n\\nExperience working with a wide range of 3rd party integrations. Our platform talks to many 3rd party applications, you should have experience building and maintaining such integrations in a test driven fashion.\\n\\nDev-ops/sysadmin skills, particularly AWS. Experience with managing servers, maintaining hosting environments, being responsible for uptime and responsiveness, addressing bottlenecks, ensuring backups are kept safe and sound.\\n\\nYou need to have immaculate attention to detail. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if something doesn’t quite look or feel right, to the nearest code change and to the nearest hexadecimal color, to the point you become annoying to us. At times other developers may edit your code, you’ll be watching to ensure the code base remains readable, scalable and fast.\\n\\nBe a good communicator. It sounds very cliché, but you’ll immerse yourself in almost every department, you’ll be learning problems and presenting solutions, and also overseeing the implementation of those solutions too.\\n\\nA self-starter. We need to see some evidence that you’re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you’ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won’t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day to day basis, you’ll be working in almost full autonomy, we’ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. We don’t believe in micro-management.\\n\\nA complete working knowledge in React. Our client code is written in React. Being able to navigate the front-end code and patch things up is needed.\\n\\nThe following skills/experience would be a bonus, but not required:\\n\\nPHP/WordPress. We will be interfacing with WordPress significantly, being able to speak the same language would be great.\\n\\nDatabases. A comprehensive experience working with various types of SQL and noSQL databases would be very useful. MySQL, Postgres, DynamoDB, Cassandra, to name a few.\\n\\nCaching. The software we’re building needs to be fast and to remain fast as we scale, both in terms of traffic and database size. Having experience with Memcached, Varnish or experience with complicated CDN setups with many rules would be a plus. \\n\\n#Salary\\n$120,000\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. Diversity drives our vibe. We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>About The Role</strong></strong></p><p>You will be responsible for technical design and work in the Billing area of Elastic’s Cloud product. This area is responsible for services that power Elastic’s SaaS subscription billing platform. This role is very impactful to Elastic -- you will collaborate with partners from Finance, Sales Operations, and IT teams to provide end-to-end billing and invoicing capabilities for our users. You will lead by example and should participate in coding, debugging complex failure scenarios, and triaging bugs. You’ll analyze the current system, participate in roadmap and project planning efforts, and will have ownership for delivering it. You’ll be participating in project management efforts as the teams execute on plans, and you’ll have a role in communicating progress and status to partners.</p><p><strong><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed components and APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is very transparent in our organization. We feel that anyone needs to be in a position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong><strong>Some of the things you'll work on</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Provide technical leadership for the Billing area of Cloud.

Examples include helping Support with difficult cases or consulting with the Sales Operations and IT teams to improve our end to end billing and reporting flow.</li><li>Be hands-on with the codebase. Review work done by the team, and provide constructive feedback.</li><li>Help the team define coding practices and standards.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>What you will bring along&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Proven experience as a software engineer, with a track record of delivering high-quality code.</li><li>Experience with Python as a programming language.</li><li>Comfortable working and communicating with teams from several functions – finance, data analytics, IT, etc.</li><li>Previous experience working with a SaaS platform or product.</li><li>Previous experience providing technical leadership for a team of software engineers.</li><li>Previous experience in an ownership role for roadmap curation and execution.</li><li>Experience gathering or analyzing usage data from hosting providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) is a huge plus.</li><li>Experience working on a SaaS subscription billing platform such as Stripe, Zoura, Recurly is a huge plus.</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><ul><li>Deeply competitive pay and benefits</li><li>Equity compensation</li><li>Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices</li><li>An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life</li><li>Passionate people building phenomenal products</li></ul><p>Elastic is an Equal Employment employer committed to the principles of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action for all applicants and employees.

We're looking for an amazing developer who is well versed in either the Magento or Drupal platform (both would be amazing). You will have the opportunity to work with leading companies and marketing teams to develop complex sites and integrations between systems.</p><p>We are a fully distributed team that primarily builds in PHP on the Magento and Drupal platforms for ecommerce and content management sites. Since we are fully remote, you can work from anywhere! We do require at least 4 hours of working time overlap with the Pacific time zone work day where most of our clients are located. As a highly client focused organization, you will occasionally need to meet according to their schedule. This typically falls between 10 and 5 Pacific time, and we strive to give you plenty of time to focus on development.</p><p>Working with a variety of clients, we fluidly form groups including a Technical Project Manager, a Quality Analyst, and one or more developers to complete sprints of work. The type of work depends on the client, but often includes:</p><ul><li>Developing custom modules and extensions for Drupal CMS and Magento Commerce.</li><li>Integration with various APIs and third-party systems.</li><li>Migrating existing sites to modern platforms.</li><li>Knowledgeable with front-end development: HTML/CSS/Javascript coding, with Twig and PHP at the template level</li></ul><p>With Bear Group, you will tackle technical problems, code and debug primarily PHP/javascript/css, and occasionally participate in client meetings. You will need to be self-motivating and able to work independently most of the time, but we have a friendly and capable team to collaborate with when you encounter obstacles. Since the technology world is constantly evolving, you’ll be expected to keep up with the current technologies and practices. To help with this, we provide an annual education stipend that can be used for attending relevant conferences or continued education courses.</p><p>During your first week you will work closely with one of our senior developers to set up your new system and familiarize with our processes and tools. The system will be either Mac, Linux, or Windows to your preference, and we use Vagrant to manage virtual machines for a consistent development server stack. Other tools you will use include:</p><ul><li>Git for source control</li><li>Bitbucket for Git repositories</li><li>Jira for project management</li><li>Confluence for documentation</li><li>Slack for communication.</li></ul><p>As you get your feet under you we will introduce some project work, again in collaboration with a senior developer on a sprint they are currently working on. Ultimately our developers work independently on your own tickets and sprints.</p><p>In addition to competitive pay, a new computer, insurance, and 401k match, you’ll also receive:</p><ul><li>3 Weeks PTO plus approximately 10 vacation days annually</li><li>$1500 annual education stipend</li><li>Software stipend for the tools that you prefer to do the job</li></ul><p><br>To learn more about the company, visit&nbsp;<a href='http://www.beargroup.com/' rel='nofollow'>www.beargroup.com</a>.

This web application will involve a heavy focus on Microservices and building API's for various internal systems. The end goal of the system is a two way communication channel between Client and they're customers. Qualified candidates will have significant experience across Drupal 8 running full stack development.<br> Non-Technical Skills: <br> This person can work remote so their communication skills have to be top notch. Also the client is a very cyber security focused organization so security focused coding practices need to be highly considered.<br> Lastly, this person may need to evaluate some of the code that has already been pushed to production for phase 1. There is some concern about the quality of that code and would like it to be reviewed.<br><br><b>About TEKsystems:</b><br><b>We're partners in transformation.
