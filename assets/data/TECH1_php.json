We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.<br><br>* We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear. We do our work with respect, and we value truth, transparency, and honesty above all else.<br><br><br><br><br>Nice to Have:<br><br><br>* You have real-world experience with Nuxt, React, or Vue.<br><br>* You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.<br><br>* Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation<br><br>* Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI<br><br>* Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals<br><br>* Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA<br><br><br><br><br>To Apply:&nbsp;<br><br>If you are interested, please apply with a resume and introduction.&nbsp;<br><br>Please feel free to skip the formality of a cover letter and write to&nbsp;me as a human being.&nbsp; If you need to use a four letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I’ll take that over what you would think I typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are and what you want in life.

On average, it takes 1-3 weeks.</p><p>More importantly though, after a decade of interviewing developers, we've learned how important it is to respect people's time. We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p><p><strong>Will I get a job immediately after applying?</strong></p><p>If your skills, experience, and values align with a current opening we have, your chances of getting hired immediately are high. If we discover you're qualified, but all opportunities have been taken, we'll continue to work with you to help you get a role in X-Team.

We want to get this down to the hundreds of milliseconds domain. Interested? There is more...</p><p>Our external API is pure Hypermedia REST + oAuth on top of Pyramid. It mechanizes the Git layer and needs more features.</p><p>We can consistently generate from the same manifest a Docker container, an LXC one, or VM disk images (AWS, Azure, OpenStack), we want more targets.</p><p>We probably have the highest industry container density. We need to get it higher.</p><p>We support any Python, Ruby, NodeJS, PHP, Java and .NET time to roll-out Elixir, of course Elixir, and Rust.</p><p>We need to have more auto-healing on the high-availability clusters. We need more performance out of our multi-protocol ssh proxy. We need work on our Ceph Implementation; We need to get the Debian package generation streamlined and faster.

Common Lisp?)</li><li>Good knowledge of how the Web works (Hacking Nginx with Lua a plus).</li><li>Good understanding of how database systems and search engines work</li><li>A good notion on distributed systems (consensus protocols like Raft/Paxos, eventual consistency models, gossip protocols)</li><li>Working knowledge of Puppet</li><li>Mad Debian Skills.

Our platform-as-a-service model is designed to take an application from the developer's app codebase to a working set of cloud environments with as few traditional &quot;devops&quot; challenges as possible. This involves a lot of really cool software (mostly written in a mix of Python and Go, and with user-facing tools in PHP and Javascript) that helps us make magical features at all layers of the traditional hosting stack: distributed and redundant storage, automated container orchestration, highly-available applications and services, fast creation and replication of environments, etc.</p><p>The company is entirely distributed with an HQ in Paris that 10-15% of the company works out of. Various team meetups or occasional get togethers both there and around the world are common.</p><p>Travel to various developer-oriented events available to developers who are interested in conferences both, for marketing and educational purposes.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from home, wherever you are</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Safe and friendly working environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options for everyone</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Rest and recovery are essential to health and happiness; we get that</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

I’m an online scheduling tech company, and I’m 10 and 3/5ths years old. But that’s, like, 30 in software company years.</p><p>Hobbies include: craft beer, using finger guns in a completely non-ironic fashion, adult coloring books (don’t act like you don’t have one), and helping businesses of all sizes manage their busy schedules. Pretty niche, I know.</p><p>“Why managing schedules?&quot; you ask? Well, I like to help people. I guess you could say I take after my dad that way. His name’s Gavin and he built me from scratch&nbsp;over 10 years ago! Can you believe it?––A whole decade!</p><p>And that brings me to what I’m doing all this for...</p><p>See, my full name is Acuity Scheduling––and no, it’s not one of those weird celeb baby names or anything. I’m a tech company. And right now, I’m looking for my ride-or-die, go-to, right-hand PHP App Developer,&nbsp;<strong><strong>whose main role will be developing the core of Acuity Scheduling's newest product,&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgetlungo.com' rel='nofollow'>Lungo</a>.</strong></strong></p><p>I’m going to describe a human, and if it sounds like you might be the human I’m describing, you should contact me. And you should probably attach your résumé.</p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p>So, let’s get down to brass tacks, shall we?</p><ul><li>You're an experienced PHP developer with a hunger to make your mark (but please don't actually bite us)</li><li>You have experience with Laravel (we use 5.6)</li><li>You're familiar with GraphQL, and will be comfortable writing GraphQL APIs</li><li>Bonus points for React experience</li></ul><p>Beyond brass tacks, here are the softer edges of the gig:</p><ul><li>You're a rare breed developer AND human, which means that you don't actually burst into flames upon being exposed to sunlight, and you're actually pretty darn great at communicating with other people. (This will be important, because all of our employees, no matter who they are, will spend time hanging out in customer service land, getting to know the product they'll be building.)</li><li>You write good... unlike this bulletpoint.</li><li>You’re the bomb dot com at solving problems. In other words, you won't run from the challenges—you'll plough straight into them like a champ. Or a developer who loves the thrill of tracking down that one mischievous OOM exception.</li><li>And last but certainly not least, you’re innovative. Because what would a job description be without &quot;innovative?&quot;</li><li>You live on planet Earth.</li></ul><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p>And by the way? These other qualities would probably help bucketsfull:</p><ul><li>You’re in favor of having 100% of your medical, dental, and vision premiums covered.</li><li>401K is your middle name. (Or if you just really like the idea of having 3% of your salary contributed to one.)</li><li>You’re an autodidact. Go on. Look it up. (You’ll get a $5,000 credit toward continuing your education.)</li></ul><p>If this description sounds like you, there’s a chance that I’d like to offer you $80k-125k. Straight up cash money. I mean, it’d be in exchange for your professional services each year, but still.</p><p>Write me. Or, you know, fill out the application that my dad, Gavin,&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;review personally. You can count on it. Which is nice because they tell me that good men are hard to find these days.</p><p>Sincerely yours,</p><p>Cutie AKA Acuity Scheduling</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://acuity-scheduling.workable.com/jobs/798709/candidates/new' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours, 100% Remote working from anywhere</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% of their medical / dental / vision premiums covered</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401K, w/ 3% of your salary contributed</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual $5,000 credit toward continuing education</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Generous vacation policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited supply of puns and dad jokes</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

    "content": "Gousto is one of Europe’s best funded and fastest growing independents. Our business is recipe boxes and our opportunity is enormous - one billion meals are eaten in the UK every week! We’re just scratching the surface on our mission to help families enjoy good food.<br /><br />Powering our business with cutting edge technology, we use data and tech to put customers first. Artificial intelligence drives everything we do, from the recipes customers see on our website, to how we put the boxes together. We’re proud of our industry-leading product and service, which helps our customer enjoy the good food, they want.<br /><br />It’s an exciting time to join Gousto. We’ve secured £28 million more funding, launched even more product ranges and continue on our mission to help UK families serve up 400 million tasty and nutritious meals by 2025.<br /><br /><br />Join us on our hugely exciting and rewarding journey!<br /><br /><br />To support this growth, we’re looking for an experienced and hugely talented Senior Software Engineer to help us take our technology platform to the next level. As a Senior Software Engineer at Gousto, you’ll be working closely with other senior members of the Engineering team to help shape our architecture, our engineering processes and help to build a massively talented engineering team.<br /><br />Our ideal candidate will have demonstrated an ability to apply their broad and deep technical skills within a commercial setting and will always be striving to solve real business problems using the most elegant technical solutions. We want someone with proven technical leadership skills and a solid understanding of what it takes to design and deliver scalable, distributed, cloud based systems in a highly available manner.<br /><br />Most of all you’ll be passionate about making Gousto a success.<br /><br /><br /><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />Key Responsibilities<br />Leading our migration to a Microservices architecture – We’re building a broad and comprehensive platform that will power a modern and complex e-commerce business. We understand that building everything from a CRM, order processing capabilities and courier integrations into a single codebase is a bad idea. We’re committed to a Microservices architecture and passionate about delivering it properly. For example, we’ve been busy building out an asynchronous messaging bus on AWS using SNS and SQS to reduce chained API calls between services, increase performance and reduce the brittleness of our systems.<br /><br />We’re looking for someone that can help us continue this journey.<br /><br />Continuing to evolve our Agile development process – We use Scrum, we like it and we believe it aligns with Gousto’s delivery led culture. However, we also understand that our processes aren’t perfect and need to evolve as we grow. We’re looking for someone who’s seen Agile delivered in complex engineering environments across multiple teams.<br /><br />Help to “Raise the Bar” – We believe that one of the most important things our senior engineers do is educate the more junior members of the team. We’re looking for an Engineer that can bring new and innovative engineering practices into the team, someone who is willing to help educate and help to improve what we do on a daily basis.<br /><br />Obsessing over quality & performance – As one of our most senior engineers you should obsess over the quality of what the team delivers. Whether that be the quality and maintainability of our code or making sure we identify and squash every bug out there. We’re also an e-commerce business, we understand that every millisecond counts when it comes to page speed and we want you to help us make our site fly!<br /><br />Building a world class engineering team – We are just at the beginning of our journey and will be looking to significantly invest in engineering talent going forwards. Helping to build a truly great team of engineers will be a hugely important part of what you do.<br /><br /><br /><br />Key capabilities<br />Broad and deep engineering skills across a number of different languages, we’re primarily developing on PHP, using both the Laravel and Lumen frameworks so experience in these is hugely advantageous.<br />A proven track record leading technology teams in complex engineering environments. Ideally you’ll have had delivery responsibility across multiple teams.<br />Experience in architecting distributed systems on a public cloud platform. Ideally you’ll have experience designing a Microservices platform on AWS (even better if you did it without servers!).<br />Worked within a Devops organisation. At Gousto our developers are responsible for the operational health of the services they develop. We believe this fosters a great culture and are looking for someone who knows how to handle those rare but critical production issues.<br />Excellent communication and presentation skills, whether to the engineering team, to business stakeholders or to our leadership team.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />Working with a passionate team who love to learn and implement new technologies<br />22 days of holiday (plus bank holidays) increasing by a day each year up to 25<br />Option to buy up to 5 additional days of annual leave<br />Coffee, tea, ice cream, cereal and fruit provided every single day to keep you fresh<br />Wine, beer and soft-drinks provided every Friday evening<br />As many new recipes to test cook as you can handle<br />40% staff discount on Gousto boxes and 25% for your family and friends<br />Free gym membership after 6 months<br />Childcare vouchers<br />Company pension<br />Cycle to work scheme<br />Regular all-company socials<br />Quarterly team socials<br />&quot;tech 10%&quot; - use every other Friday to sharpen your own skills and work on your own projects<br /><br />Equal opportunity<br /><br />We are dedicated to equal opportunities in all areas of Gousto. We employ over 20 nationalities and believe it’s fundamental to represent all genders in all functions and levels. All individuals will be treated in a fair and equal manner and in accordance with the law regardless of age, disability, gender, pregnancy and maternity, marital status, race, religion or sexual orientation.

We are building new tools that help detect harassment and stalking, create a safe space for people to report harassment, help wiki administrators to evaluate reports, and block unwanted harassers from our projects. You will work with a product manager, an analyst, an engineering manager, and other developers to tackle these objectives.</p><p>This is an ideal opportunity for a member of the community to leverage their skills and experience and help the Foundation support the community better. We are interested in supporting and growing a newer developer through mentorship, coaching, and increasing opportunity.</p><p>We use open source tools as much as possible, and always open source our own work (https://git.wikimedia.org). PHP, Javascript, and Python make up most of our code, but we value using the right tool for the job. Developers at the Foundation have autonomy and responsibility, and can have a large and immediate impact on the future of the site and the movement. Our world is vast and can be complicated, so we value communication, enthusiasm, and eagerness to learn as much as certificates or degrees.</p><p></p><strong>As a Software Engineer, we’d like you to do these things:</strong><ul></ul><li>Design, develop, test, and deploy new features, improvements and upgrades to various systems and tools used by the Wikipedia community</li><li>Partner with Foundation staff and volunteers on software design, development, testing and evaluation</li><li>Help identify and implement best practices in engineering processes across the team</li><li>Ensure positive and constructive discussions with the community and the Foundation</li><li>Work and communicate effectively within a small team distributed across multiple time zones</li><p></p><strong>We’d like you to have these skills:</strong><ul></ul><li>Education and beginner experience with Object-Oriented development using a scripting language (PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript)</li><li>Interest in front-end web application development skills</li><li>Experience with the Wikimedia community, or a similar open source or collaborative community</li><li>Openness to working with a diverse and geographically distributed team</li><li>Strong written communication skills as our collaboration largely happens online</li><li>Bachelor’s degree in CS or related field or the equivalent in work related experience</li><p></p><strong>And it would be even more awesome if you have this:</strong><p></p><em>In addition to the basic skills needed for being successful, these skills could set you apart from the pack!</em><ul></ul><li>Experience with MediaWiki development</li><li>Experience with Test-Driven Development and agile methodologies</li><li>Any other free/open source software development experience is highly welcome</li><li>Understanding of the free culture movement</li><li>Experience with machine learning or AI technologies</li><li>Experience with online community moderation or anti-harassment tools</li><p></p><strong>Show us your stuff!</strong><p></p><em>If you have any existing open source software that you’ve developed (these could be your own software or patches to other packages), please share the URLs for the source.

We are a growing team of 6 people with plans to expand rapidly by the end of 2018.<br><br>With multiple new product launches on the horizon and several more planned before the end of the year, you will be joining the company at a time of explosive growth. Your presence will have a very real impact on the company’s value.<br><br>We are looking for a Backend Web Developer to join our tech team’s efforts to supercharge our PHP web application. You will be working directly with Pierre-Camille, our founder, who developed the original product from scratch, as well as with all members of the tech, marketing, and success teams.<br><br>Our company is fully distributed and remote. We believe and fully embrace that your best environment is wherever you - personally - feel the most productive and comfortable for day-to-day work. Nevertheless, we organise frequent meetups and retreats for the team to physically meet throughout the year. The last two trips were to Lisbon/Cascais and Paris!<br><br> <br><br>⭐️ What you will do: ⭐️<br><br>• You will be an architect: planning structural masterpieces, laying foundations, building pillars, and reinforcing walls. Maybe a statue here and there…<br><br>• You will be in charge of drastically improving multiple features for our web app, helping to developing new product lines, as well as improving and maintaining the quality of the entire codebase.<br><br>• You will be a leader in performance (logic optimisation, indexes, queries, caching), security (discovering and plugging vulnerabilities), and code health (refactoring, unit and integration testing).<br><br>• You will take charge of your own work and proactively suggest improvements across the whole backend.<br><br>• In a remote environment you will be responsible for your own time and results – there will be no babysitting.<br><br> <br><br>✅ What you will need to succeed: ✅<br><br>• Nutcracker: you love solving engineering problems.<br><br>• Independent: you are self-motivated, take initiative, and are a strong communicator. You are results-driven and willing to learn and improve yourself.<br><br>• Technical Ninja: proficiency with PHP 7.0+, Laravel 5.2+, MySQL, Git, beanstalkd, and Memcached and/or Redis, backed by 5+ years of Backend development experience.<br><br>• Design Pattern Jedi: great knowledge of and direct experience with multiple design patterns. You have written superbly abstracted code and accompanying unit tests from scratch. You have also refactored legacy, non-testable code into something less apocalyptic.<br><br>• Caring Developer: you recognise that your code and work impact not only the customers but also the rest of the team. You conduct yourself with professionalism and respect not only in meetings but also in how you structure your code and in the documentation that you write.<br><br>• Superb English fluency: we are an international team and clear communication is vital. It goes without saying (but we’ll say it anyway) that you absolutely must have the ability to participate in frequent video meetings.<br><br>• The product team is based in Europe, so at the moment we are looking for developers who are based within the same general time zones (UTC±3).<br><br> <br><br> Brownie points: <br><br>• You have experience with Continuous Integration using Travis, Circle, Gitlab, or Bitbucket.<br><br>• Interactive Git rebasing doesn’t sound like voodoo to you.<br><br>• You’ve used in Git commit messages.<br><br>• You have experience with Machine Learning either with off-the-shelf tools like Dialog Flow or - better yet - more low level using tools and platforms like Theano, Torch, and Google/AWS/Microsoft/IBM ML stacks.<br><br>• You’ve built a Node.JS backend or API.<br><br>• You see past the glossy veneer of the ‘microservices’ buzzword and know when and how to build them.<br><br>(Let us know how many  you deserve.)<br> <br> <br> <br> What we offer: <br><br>• Competitive salary, including the possibility of stock options.<br><br>• Ample paid leave, in addition to maternity and paternity leave.<br><br>• A great support structure: we are here for you.<br><br>• Flexible contract. You will work independently where you are most productive and happiest, with flexible weekday hours.<br><br>• All the resources and tools that you need to succeed<br><br>• Join a fast-growing startup and be part of the force that shapes the company in the years to come!<br> <br> <br> <br>We are solving global short-term rental automation.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span></p><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>1. Solve Interesting Problems</span></p><p><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</span></p><p><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We don’t work like that.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</span></p><p><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>4. Get Expert Guidance</span></p><p><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</span></p><p><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</span></p><p><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>7. Stability You Can Count On</span></p><p><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</span></p><p><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</span></p><h2><span>Here’s What We Expect From You…</span></h2><ul><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’re excellent at PHP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have an excellent attention to detail</span></li></ul><p><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

As a Senior Software Engineer at Gousto, you’ll be working closely with other senior members of the Engineering team to help shape our architecture, our engineering processes and help to build a massively talented engineering team.</p><p>Our ideal candidate will have demonstrated an ability to apply their broad and deep technical skills within a commercial setting and will always be striving to solve real business problems using the most elegant technical solutions. We want someone with proven technical leadership skills and a solid understanding of what it takes to design and deliver scalable, distributed, cloud based systems in a highly available manner.</p><p>Most of all you’ll be passionate about making Gousto a success.</p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p><strong>Key Responsibilities</strong></p><p><strong>Leading our migration to a Microservices architecture –&nbsp;</strong>We’re building a broad and comprehensive platform that will power a modern and complex e-commerce business. We understand that building everything from a CRM, order processing capabilities and courier integrations into a single codebase is a bad idea. We’re committed to a Microservices architecture and passionate about delivering it properly. For example, we’ve been busy building out an asynchronous messaging bus on AWS using SNS and SQS to reduce chained API calls between services, increase performance and reduce the brittleness of our systems.</p><p>We’re looking for someone that can help us continue this journey.</p><p><strong>Continuing to evolve our Agile development process –&nbsp;</strong>We use Scrum, we like it and we believe it aligns with Gousto’s delivery led culture. However, we also understand that our processes aren’t perfect and need to evolve as we grow. We’re looking for someone who’s seen Agile delivered in complex engineering environments across multiple teams.</p><p><strong>Help to “Raise the Bar” –&nbsp;</strong>We believe that one of the most important things our senior engineers do is educate the more junior members of the team. We’re looking for an Engineer that can bring new and innovative engineering practices into the team, someone who is willing to help educate and help to improve what we do on a daily basis.</p><p><strong>Obsessing over quality &amp; performance –&nbsp;</strong>As one of our most senior engineers you should obsess over the quality of what the team delivers. Whether that be the quality and maintainability of our code or making sure we identify and squash every bug out there. We’re also an e-commerce business, we understand that every millisecond counts when it comes to page speed and we want you to help us make our site fly!</p><p><strong>Building a world class engineering team –&nbsp;</strong>We are just at the beginning of our journey and will be looking to significantly invest in engineering talent going forwards. Helping to build a truly great team of engineers will be a hugely important part of what you do.</p><p><strong>Key capabilities</strong></p><ul><li>Broad and deep engineering skills across a number of different languages, we’re primarily developing on PHP, using both the Laravel and Lumen frameworks so experience in these is hugely advantageous.</li><li>A proven track record leading technology teams in complex engineering environments. Ideally you’ll have had delivery responsibility across multiple teams.</li><li>Experience in architecting distributed systems on a public cloud platform. Ideally you’ll have experience designing a Microservices platform on AWS (even better if you did it without servers!).</li><li>Worked within a Devops organisation. At Gousto our developers are responsible for the operational health of the services they develop. We believe this fosters a great culture and are looking for someone who knows how to handle those rare but critical production issues.</li><li>Excellent communication and presentation skills, whether to the engineering team, to business stakeholders or to our leadership team.</li></ul><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><ul><li>Working with a passionate team who love to learn and implement new technologies</li><li>22 days of holiday (plus bank holidays) increasing by a day each year up to 25</li><li>Option to buy up to 5 additional days of annual leave</li><li>Coffee, tea, ice cream, cereal and fruit provided every single day to keep you fresh</li><li>Wine, beer and soft-drinks provided every Friday evening</li><li>As many new recipes to test cook as you can handle</li><li>40% staff discount on Gousto boxes and 25% for your family and friends</li><li>Free gym membership after 6 months</li><li>Childcare vouchers</li><li>Company pension</li><li>Cycle to work scheme</li><li>Regular all-company socials</li><li>Quarterly team socials</li><li>&quot;tech 10%&quot; - use every other Friday to sharpen your own skills and work on your own projects</li></ul><p><strong>Equal opportunity</strong></p><p>We are dedicated to equal opportunities in all areas of Gousto. We employ over 20 nationalities and believe it’s fundamental to represent all genders in all functions and levels. All individuals will be treated in a fair and equal manner and in accordance with the law regardless of age, disability, gender, pregnancy and maternity, marital status, race, religion or sexual orientation.

    "content": "_About SpeechKit_    <br /><br />SpeechKit is a fast-growing audio-as-a-service product for news publishers. We are building a complete toolkit to assist in the production, distribution and monetisation of audio content that will help digital news publishers reach new audiences and engage existing subscribers.<br /><br />Our business is reaching an inflection point and we are quickly onboarding new publishers by the day. This business is quickly evolving into an exciting new provider of a brand new format of news.<br /><br />We are a lean team in a phase of consolidation. This is an opportunity to join an early stage business in a high growth market providing the first of its kind service.<br /><br />_The Role_<br /><br />We are looking for a mid-level engineer with experience in leading a team in building B2B Saas products. Whilst the role is for the lead engineer in our team, we are looking for a candidate that not only has experience across our stack but also shows a willingness and enthusiasm to lead our product development through this exciting phase. <br /><br />The role will involve, but not be limited to, the following; <br /><br />* Helping define the product roadmap alongside CEO and COO.<br />* Ownership and responsibility for technical product development.<br />* Hands-on technical development across the stack.<br />* Leadership and management of the technical team.<br /><br />We currently rely heavily on contractual work for the majority of our development. It will be your job to transition from this model and lay the foundations for a team capable of sustaining our growth through the following years.<br /><br />_Core technology stack experience:_<br /><br />* Ruby on Rails 5.<br />* Python (RSS/URL text extraction).<br />* PHP (WordPress plugin development).<br />* Javascript, HTML, CSS.<br />* PostgreSQL.<br />* ELK (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana).<br />* AWS, DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, Heroku.<br /><br />_What would make you stand out;_<br /><br />* Experience and interest in machine learning and speech synthesis.<br />* Google NLP API expertise.<br />* Audio encoding know-how (ffmpeg and HLS).<br />* Background in statistics.<br />* Voice/sound design experience.<br />* Experience with media players and advertising standards e.g., VAAST and DAAST.<br />* Experience with smart speaker technology e.g., Alexa and Google Home.<br />* Mobile SDK development.<br />* React Native.<br /><br />_More about SpeechKit_<br /><br />We are a young team who have been chasing a vision for on-the-go audio news for the best part of a decade. The two founders have 10 years experience running startups between them and Speechkit is an evolution of two previous startups that has moulded a business we believe to have hit a sweet spot in an emerging market. <br /><br />We launched an MVP product in March this year and have experienced 30% growth month-on-month since that launch. We are now entering a phase of consolidation of the product, marketing and business process to ensure steady growth into the next phase of the business. <br /><br />We are well funded and ready to scale the team and business to mirror our growth prospects. Currently, we are working semi-remote and will be taking office space in mid-September. This role will be location flexible, meaning you will, for the most part, be able to manage your time working from the location of your choice or have a desk at the office. <br /><br />_Salary and Perks_<br /><br />This is an opportunity to join a dynamic and exciting business at its inception. We are looking to at a base salary for this role of £65,000 and will make judgements on an increase if expertise expands into relevant fields. Share options will also be negotiated after 3 months of the role. Holiday will start at 25 days, with flexible working location conditions. We will endeavour to meet any other suggestions you have for the role and its rewards.",

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span></p><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>1. Solve Interesting Problems</span></p><p><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</span></p><p><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We don’t work like that.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</span></p><p><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>4. Get Expert Guidance</span></p><p><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</span></p><p><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</span></p><p><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>7. Stability You Can Count On</span></p><p><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</span></p><p><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</span></p><h2><span>Here’s What We Expect From You…</span></h2><ul><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’re excellent at PHP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have an excellent attention to detail</span></li></ul><p><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.
