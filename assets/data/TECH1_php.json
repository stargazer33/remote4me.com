improves the discussion of news articles by allowing users to tag incorrect facts, bad reasoning or uncivil behavior. It is a place where people can comment on news in depth, and share their opinions through social media. </p><p>When multiple people have &quot;fisked&quot; the same article, the system produces a page which highlights the flaws or qualities in the text, as determined by a statistical test of significance of the (human-input) tags. In short, it has the potential to fact-check all online news/content in real time.</p><p>Additionally, by allowing users to fisk each other's comments, we create a granular, peer-reviewed discussion of the topic which is much more useful - and useable -  for interested readers. This allows us to build in a Troll Filter which will enable readers to weed out bad-faith commentary, while preserving Fiskkit's &quot;No Censorship&quot; principle. </p><p>It's the future of online engagement.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Francisco</span>, <span>United States</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>$21K Seed in 2014</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Digital Media</span>, <span>News</span>, <span>Blogging Platforms</span>, <span>Writers</span></div><div><div></div><a href='http://twitter.com/fiskkit' rel='nofollow'>@fiskkit</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://fiskkit.com' rel='nofollow'>fiskkit.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/645/391645-448935d3377d1e925a3c4868e17c8b5d97850972.jpg?1409434617' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/647/391647-1e2834f49606b3cc6be857b62670a3939201a96a.jpg?1409434718' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/653/391653-4abd9dfabc6ac13a568b82e72b51dd09de011e30.png?1409439518' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/654/391654-3db0f14b8aa81d645cbb9119181aa85131aa4726.png?1409439529' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/658/391658-79c6f923d2c1e0cbb66632c67a0449fed8efaa64.jpg?1409441817' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/386434-fiskkit?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;Fiskkit&quot;

Our team members each contribute to the success of each project and the company as a whole. We learn from each other, collaborate cohesively, help each other grow and hone our skillsets, and have fun together - from different corners of the world. Our work isn’t about creating busyness, we are here to build businesses through innovative inbound marketing. </p><p>If you are a good fit for us (and we for you), we will work together. Rather than make you fit into a position defined by a boxed-in title, we aim to understand your strengths, interests, and passions and how they can fit within our team. Depending on when you apply, as well as the amount of recent applicants, we might not have work for you right away. And due to the sheer amount of applicants, we are not able to respond to all of them personally or always fast enough. Most of our team members started out with a couple of hours a week. Some had other projects and some wanted to test the water before giving up on a full time job elsewhere.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to InboundLabs</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to InboundLabs</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>InboundLabs is hiring an extremely talented front end developer.</p><p>InboundLabs.co is an international agency-hybrid, with a remote team that works together seamlessly.

Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. That’s a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?</strong></p><p>RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, FT, Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Australian Herald to name a few.

We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apply if you want to:</strong></p><ul> <li>Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.</li> <li>Play a critical role in the design and development of our platform.</li> <li>Design, build and optimise front end solutions that have results. </li> <li>Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making our site best in class.</li> </ul><br><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br><ul> <li>Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.</li> <li>25 days holiday</li> <li>Pension Scheme</li> <li>We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office.

We're looking to add build features, upgrade and maintain our existing systems, as well as plan for a transition where pieces of these systems are either migrated to Drupal 8 or other new solutions over the course of the next couple years. All of this work is intimately connected to the rest of our cloud hosting and devops tooling product -- interest in the &quot;devops&quot; problem space and solving problems for our cloud customers is key. Our team stands at the forefront of user experience, as well as new features being offered to our customers and partners. Being comfortable tackling programming problems from the architecture level all the way down to proper code implementation is a big plus -- the team is small, the to-do list long, and engineers generally have a great deal of autonomy to implement features and drive the product forward. &nbsp;Your contribution matters.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Must Have</strong></p><p>- Senior-level experience with Drupal back-end development (both 7 and 8 ideally) -- custom modules and product/feature builds in Drupal</p><p>- Desire to tackle feature implementation and user experience design challenges from a high-level user story view through final implementation</p><p>- Solid experience with web development patterns and the needs of engineers using a web app development and hosting tool</p><p><strong>Nice to have</strong></p><p>- Familiarity with the other languages in our stack (Javascript, Go, Python)</p><p>- Experience or interest in the &quot;cloud computing&quot; stuff that makes up our back end, anything from distributed computing to networking to devops and the big box that is &quot;make a bunch of Linux containers play nicely together&quot;</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://grnh.se/7ecddeb52' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Platform.sh</h3>            <div><p>Platform.sh is a next-generation hosting and development tool for a wide variety of web applications. Our platform-as-a-service model is designed to take an application from the developer's app codebase to a working set of cloud environments with as few traditional &quot;devops&quot; challenges as possible. This involves a lot of really cool software (mostly written in a mix of Python and Go, and with user-facing tools in PHP and Javascript) that helps us make magical features at all layers of the traditional hosting stack: distributed and redundant storage, automated container orchestration, highly-available applications and services, fast creation and replication of environments, etc.</p><p>The company is entirely distributed with an HQ in Paris that 10-15% of the company works out of.

No-Bullshit-iest Way We Can Describe This Job In The Least Amount Of Words In A Run-On Sentence: </strong></p><p>We build a lot of different kinds of stuff for a lot of different kinds of folks (<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/work/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/work/</a>) at a shop that is big enough to bite off important, meaningful work and small enough to have fun doing it and we’re looking for an engineer who is equally at ease talking to clients, designers, producers, and developers about things like scope, resource allocation, solutions to engineering problems, creative ideas for how to build things, ways to articulate technical complexity to normal business humans...and occasionally...cut some code.</p><p><strong>Here’s What We Think You Probably Need to Be Successful At This Job: </strong></p><ul><li>Have agency experience, leading a development team spread across multiple projects and clients.</li><li>Hands on developer and leader</li><li>Are comfortable reviewing project specifications, collaborating with company leadership to develop project estimates and technical specs</li><li>Experienced in code reviews to adhere to best practices and internal standards, providing feedback and following up on remediation</li><li>You have an ear to the ground for new tech, whether it comes from hacker news or a programming subreddit, and a desire to dive in and try it out.</li><li>Experience in architecting and building bespoke custom WordPress themes using Advanced Custom Fields, Gravity Forms, Yoast with custom integrations to third party systems.</li><li>Experience in client and server-side debugging, performance profiling and optimization techniques with an uncanny intuition for finding the cause and solution</li><li>Experience with integration of analytics, a/b testing, and advertising platforms using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Planning out projects in coordination with Project Manager/Producer and Developer team members, participating in project check-ins providing feedback to the team</li><li>Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals</li><li>Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA</li><li>Comfortable working with small projects (1 dev) and medium projects (2-3 devs)</li><li>Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation</li><li>Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI</li><li>Comfortable in architecting and implementation of APIs in PHP/Laravel, NodeJS/Express and other similar stacks.</li><li>Attention to detail and a seamless user experience. &nbsp;This means making the product look like the design and working with your team to make it smooth and perfect.</li><li>You have real-world experience with React. &nbsp;AngularJS knowledge might be transferable, but React is what we're looking for.</li><li>jQuery is &quot;nice to have&quot; but NOT necessary in your arsenal. &nbsp;You respect the finer points of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear. We do our work with respect, and we value truth, transparency, and honesty above all else.</li></ul><p>To Apply:&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested, please apply with a resume and introduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Please feel free to skip the formality of a cover letter and write to&nbsp;me as a human being.&nbsp; If you need to use a four letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I’ll take that over what you would think I typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are and what you want in life. Just tell me.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/192578?reset=False&amp;ra=12AfxD422agE&amp;oqs=a%3D12AfxD422agE' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Sanborn</h3>            <div><p>We're a 25-person interactive shop working with all manner of organizations (sports teams, beauty brands, magazines, non-profits, pharmaceutical companies, startups) helping to create and manage the full battery of digital media goodness (web, mobile, content, video and experiential activations to be specific).</p><p>We believe passionate, talented people all working together smoothly yields awesome work that lets us come back and do it again tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Some more about where we stand as a company:&nbsp;<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/about</a></p><p><strong>About Our Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>The team is made of folks who seem to enjoy bouncing in and out of different projects of different sizes with varying engineering challenges associated with them.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Our designers are highly technical and our engineers are very invested in the visual fidelity of their work - so some of the lines that typically divide UI/UX and engineering cultures don't really exist here.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>At any one given time we'll have folks on longer term missions (ie - 6 to 8 month long-term projects where we're in more of a product development posture) and people on shorter term campaign-based work where we're trying to explode a firecracker in the sky, measure how far and bright it travels, and then move onto to the next one.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>We try to keep plates of work varied and diversified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Everyone is a grownup.&nbsp;</li></ul>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work friendly environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full health benefits package.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Los Angeles office locations.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shithead eco-flush system ensuring shitheadless working environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Family owned and operated.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</div><div><br></div><div>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</div><div><br></div><div>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</div><div><br></div><div>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.<br></div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</h2></div><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</div><div><br></div><div>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</div><div><br></div><div>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</div><div><br></div><div>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</div><div><br></div><div>We don’t work like that.</div><div><br></div><div>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</div><div><br></div><div>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</div><div><br></div><div>We get how important growth is for developers.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</div><div><br></div><div>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</div><div><br></div><div>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</div><div><br></div><div>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</div><div><br></div><div>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</div><div><br></div><div>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</div><div><br></div><div>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</strong><br></div><div>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</div><div><br></div><div>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</div><div><br></div><div>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</div><div><br></div><div>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>Here’s What We Expect From You…</h2></div><ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’re excellent at PHP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have an excellent attention to detail</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria. Other applications will not be considered.&nbsp;<br></div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>Apply Here: https://iPhonePhotographySchool.com/developer?utm_source=WhereverJobs</h2></div><div>If you delay submitting your application, someone else will be hired before you.</div>            </div><div>How to apply:<br>Apply here: <a href='https://iPhonePhotographySchool.com/developer?utm_sourceWhereverJobs' rel='nofollow'>iPhonePhotographySchool.com/developer</a></div>"

    "content": "Weengs is writing e-commerce history, day by day, providing Amazon-like fulfilment infrastructure and services to small e-commerce businesses. When Amazon has Prime, small businesses have Weengs.<br /><br />We're the definition of a promising, fun, fast-growing startup. The next European unicorn in the make. We started from a flat in London, shipping 6,000 parcels without getting kicked out (our neighbours love us), running operations during day and writing code during night. We're now over 60 people, shipping thousands of parcels every day, operating through a big warehouse.<br /><br />Since our start in 2015, customers have expressed their love with fan mail, we’ve been backed by top-tier investors and we’ve grown 700% since last year.<br /><br />Here’s how Weengs works: we collect unboxed orders from our customers, bring them to our warehouse, package them carefully with our own materials, then ship them using major shipping carriers like Royal Mail, DHL etc at the best available prices.<br /><br />We work with small businesses around London via our web app as well as with e-commerce platforms that are integrated with our system via an API.<br /><br />Our technology<br /><br />We build proprietary software for fulfilment process within our warehouse, a smart shipping engine and integrations with e-commerce platforms and carriers. You’ll see your work in action not only by customers on a web dashboard, but also in complex physical operations in a warehouse, allowing people to perform physical tasks efficiently and reliably. We put together many moving parts from the digital world with the physical world. This requires an authentic engineering mindset, with attention to reliability and performance.<br /><br />Here’s what  you’ll be asked to work on:<br /><br />A web app on Vue.js for our merchants<br />A public API build on PHP Laravel<br />A few internal apps build on PHP Laravel<br />A mobile app for drivers build on React Native<br />A few internal apps build on Electron & Vue.js<br />A few microservices build on Node.js<br />This is the stack we’re currently using<br /><br />All our infrastructure is on AWS<br />Our data lives on MySQL and PostgreSQL<br />Backend on PHP/Laravel<br />Front-end on Vue.js<br />Internal desktop apps on Electron<br />Microservices on AWS Lambda + Node.js<br />Heavy use of queues - SQS + Database<br />These are the practices and tools we use<br /><br />We currently have a hybrid Monolithic Microkernel architecture, and exploring our next direction<br />Delivering continuously using JIRA, BitBucket, CircleCI and Elastic Beanstalk<br />Logging, monitoring and troubleshooting with Loggly, Monitis, NewRelic and Sentry<br />As we serve web apps, mobile clients, drivers, warehouses, and carriers, you'll also need to be able to integrate with a range of third-party APIs. You’ll need to be able to iterate fast and deploy daily, but you’ll do so without bureaucracy or boring meetings. You’ll be exposed to the whole business in an environment where your ideas count.<br /><br />Our tech team<br /><br />We are currently a team of 7 engineers with a plan to reach 18 engineers within 2019. We work in 2-week sprints and our developers can touch any part of the business. Our main principle is to keep an open team where everybody can contribute and influence technical decisions.<br /><br />We love writing good code and keeping a good architecture in place. We love PHP & Laravel and we upgrade to latest versions asap. We devote Fridays to refactoring and improving our codebase, allowing us to develop better and faster the rest of the week.<br /><br />About you<br /><br />We're interested only in people who want to be part of the success story of a startup, put their DNA in the product, building the foundation and evolve together with the company. We want you to own your field of responsibility, take decisions, be proactive, screw up things with pride and fix broken things with more pride. We help each other learn and improve, no matter which your starting point is, and we need you to be curious and brave. You are a team player and love giving or receiving constructive feedback. We also have zero tolerance for big egos, heros or blaming, no matter how good developer you are.<br /><br />We’d like you to be good in communicating ideas, as you’ll regularly present your ideas and projects to the team, as also work directly with non-developers when working on their projects.<br /><br />RESPONSIBILITIES<br /><br />Have ownership of new projects as also collaborate on existing projects<br />Work with our team to refine the architectural and functional roadmap of our product.<br />Work directly with and report to Alex (co-founder & CTO) to build the foundation of the company's software.<br />Write robust application code in PHP/Laravel that powers the company’s demanding web and mobile client APIs.<br />Refactor existing software and functionality into discrete services.<br />Make sure all systems are adequately tested and monitored for uptime, consistency and performance.<br />Review your teammates’ code before going in action<br /><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />Professional experience with server-side PHP scripting (5+ years). You love PHP and know how to use the latest version of it.<br />Experience with Laravel or any modern web framework (2+ years).<br />Know what a technical debt is, when to create it and how to pay it back.<br />Experience in designing, building, and consuming public APIs.<br />Familiar with AWS for full stack implementation: EC2, S3, RDS, Route 53 etc.<br />Experience with relational databases (MySQL).<br />Understanding of modern web stacks and architecture (HTTP, REST).<br />Knowledge of the value of well-written documentation, continuous integration, and security rules.<br />Knowledge of design patterns, good practices and latest evolvements in software development.<br />Eager to work in a fast-paced startup environment and a desire to disrupt logistics.<br />Not throwing out GoT spoilers on Monday mornings (even though we watch it live, of course).<br />A sense of humour.<br /><br /><br />PREFERENCE GIVEN TO APPLICANTS WITH THE FOLLOWING<br /><br />Experience with ecommerce platforms (Magento, WooCommerce, Amazon etc).<br />Experience with web architecture at scale.<br />Experience with key-value stores (Memcache, Redis).<br />Experience with logistics.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />£40-£70K salary, depending on experience<br />Work remotely often<br />Top-notch kit.

Future</div><div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div>It is my pleasure to recommend 24/7 Teach. Over the last two years, our Health Services Office has worked directly with Justice Jones, CEO, on a training and professional development platform for our school employees. The company offered high quality, service and rates. Across the board, we have been pleased with their work, attention to detail, and management of our platform. Development and implementation of our school's first web-based Administration of Medication Training Course is a prime example of 24/7 Teach's concern for quality and attention to detail. 24/7 Teach helped design the platform including personalization and ease of access. The response rate and increased knowledge was incredible compared to previous trainings.In my opinion, it has been the knowledge and the creativity of 24/7 Teach that resulted in such impressive results. I strongly recommend the services of 24/7 Teach and look forward to working with the company on future training.Dr. Jasmin WhitfieldSidwell Friends SchoolWashington, DC</div><div><div><a

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</span></p><h2><span>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</span></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>1. Solve Interesting Problems</span></p><p><span>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</span></p><p><span>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We don’t work like that.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</span></p><p><span>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We get how important growth is for developers.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’l</span><span>l pay for it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>4. Get Expert Guidance</span></p><p><span>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</span></p><p><span>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</span></p><p><span>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><span>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</span></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>7. Stability You Can Count On</span></p><p><span>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</span></p><p><span>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</span></p><h2><span>Here’s What We Expect From You…</span></h2><ul><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’re excellent at PHP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You want to participate in scrum teamwork</span></li><li><span> &nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>You have an excellent attention to detail</span></li></ul><p><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.</div><div><br></div><div>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there’s a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built upon complex development solutions that we’ve created from scratch.</div><div><br></div><div>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.</div><div><br></div><div>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.<br></div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</h2></div><div><br></div><div><strong>1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong><br></div><div>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.</div><div><br></div><div>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</div><div><br></div><div>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.</div><div><br></div><div>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”</div><div><br></div><div>We don’t work like that.</div><div><br></div><div>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.</div><div><br></div><div>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.</div><div><br></div><div>We get how important growth is for developers.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.</div><div><br></div><div>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.</div><div><br></div><div>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.</div><div><br></div><div>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?</div><div><br></div><div>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next the day… And this cycle repeats itself again and again.</div><div><br></div><div>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.</div><div><br></div><div>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</strong><br></div><div>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you’ve spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.</div><div><br></div><div>You don’t have to worry about the company running out of money.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.</div><div><br></div><div>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.</div><div><br></div><div>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>Here’s What We Expect From You…</h2></div><ul><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’re excellent at PHP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You’ve worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to participate in scrum teamwork</li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have an excellent attention to detail</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria. Other applications will not be considered.&nbsp;<br></div><div><h2><br></h2></div><div><h2>Apply Here: https://iPhonePhotographySchool.com/developer?utm_source=weworkremotely</h2></div><div>If you delay submitting your application, someone else will be hired before you.</div><span>Apply now</span></div>"
