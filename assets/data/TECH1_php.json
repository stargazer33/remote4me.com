We now have over 10,000 tutors across the UK delivering over 10,000 lessons per week, both in person and online. Our revolutionary approach to tutoring and our fantastic growth have helped us become recognised as one of the top 100 startups in the UK.<br /><br />We’re building a stellar team to help us achieve our goal. We strive to create an environment where you can do your best work - our people are empowered to make the bold decisions others wouldn’t, and make a genuine impact on the lives of thousands of young learners. Join us, and you’ll be challenged and supported in equal measure. <br /><br />The role<br />We are looking for a full stack developer who can help define and build the customer-facing side of our business. The role will include:<br />Joining a small, autonomous, agile team using modern web development methodologies such as continuous delivery.<br />Working with your team to come up with ideas and define the backlog, with the aim of solving real customer problems.<br />Bringing new features to life, from initial design through to writing well structured modular code, automated tests, and deployment. <br />Working closely with other teams around the office, including product managers, marketing and customer support. <br /><br />What we’re looking for<br />We don’t have an ideal candidate, and aptitude and a willingness to learn are just as important than qualifications or experience. With that said, having familiarity with some of the technologies and methodologies below would be beneficial: <br />Prior experience and success building products as  a full stack developer.<br />Knowledge of PHP 7, and a modern framework such as Laravel or Symfony.<br />Experience building and using scalable APIs.<br />Familiarity with modern devops, including deployment pipelines. <br />Fluency with at least one major Javascript framework (ideally Vue, but experience in React or Angular would also be applicable).<br />An understanding of scalable frontend architecture.<br />Familiarity with modern tooling such as Grunt/Gulp, Webpack, Docker, Git etc.<br /><br />If you have skills that align with this role and you could contribute to our goals but your experience or salary expectations don't match what we're offering, don't be put off. We look for the right people and we are flexible, so we'd still encourage applications from strong candidates.<br /><br />Benefits:<br />Some of our benefits include:<br />25 days holiday, with an extra day for each year you are with us (up to 28). <br />An additional 5 days holiday through salary sacrifice.<br />Genuinely flexible working, with remote working on Wednesdays. <br />A great office environment, including free fruit, beer on Thursday afternoons, and regular company-organised socials. <br />Regular conference opportunities and a dedicated training budget. <br />A generous equity scheme for senior employees. <br /><br />Please send CV’s if you feel you would be a good fit for this role. We look forward to hearing from you.",

We’re looking for an amazing developer who is well versed in either the Magento or Drupal platform (both would be amazing). You will have the opportunity to work with leading companies and marketing teams to develop complex sites and integrations between systems.</p>\n <p>We are a fully distributed team that primarily builds in PHP on the Magento and Drupal platforms for ecommerce and content management sites. <strong>Since we are fully remote, you can work from anywhere! We do require at least 4 hours of working time overlap with the Pacific time zone work day</strong> where most of our clients are located. As a highly client focused organization, you will occasionally need to meet according to their schedule. This typically falls between 10 and 5 Pacific time, and we strive to give you plenty of time to focus on development.</p>\n <p>Working with a variety of clients, we fluidly form groups including a Technical Project Manager, a Quality Analyst, and one or more developers to complete sprints of work.</p>\n <p><strong>The type of work depends on the client, but often includes:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Developing custom modules and extensions for Drupal CMS and Magento Commerce.</li>\n  <li>Integration with various APIs and third-party systems.</li>\n  <li>Migrating existing sites to modern platforms.</li>\n  <li>Knowledgeable with front-end development: HTML/CSS/Javascript coding, with Twig and PHP at the template level</li>\n </ul>\n <p>With Bear Group, you will tackle technical problems, code and debug primarily PHP/javascript/css, and occasionally participate in client meetings. You will need to be self-motivating and able to work independently most of the time, but we have a friendly and capable team to collaborate with when you encounter obstacles. Since the technology world is constantly evolving, you’ll be expected to keep up with the current technologies and practices. To help with this, we provide an annual education stipend that can be used for attending relevant conferences or continued education courses.</p>\n <p>During your first week you will work closely with one of our senior developers to set up your new system and familiarize with our processes and tools.

    "content": "<h3> Drupal / Magento Developer </h3>\n<div>\n <div>\n  Bear Group is a leading web development firm based in Seattle looking for an experienced backend web developer to join our team of Drupal and Magento. We're looking for an amazing developer who is well versed in either the Magento or Drupal platform (both would be amazing). You will have the opportunity to work with leading companies and marketing teams to develop complex sites and integrations between systems.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We are a fully distributed team that primarily builds in PHP on the Magento and Drupal platforms for ecommerce and content management sites. Since we are fully remote, you can work from anywhere! We do require at least 4 hours of working time overlap with the Pacific time zone work day where most of our clients are located. As a highly client focused organization, you will occasionally need to meet according to their schedule. This typically falls between 10 and 5 Pacific time, and we strive to give you plenty of time to focus on development.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Working with a variety of clients, we fluidly form groups including a Technical Project Manager, a Quality Analyst, and one or more developers to complete sprints of work. The type of work depends on the client, but often includes:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Developing custom modules and extensions for Drupal CMS and Magento Commerce.</li>\n  <li>Integration with various APIs and third-party systems.</li>\n  <li>Migrating existing sites to modern platforms.</li>\n  <li>Knowledgeable with front-end development: HTML/CSS/Javascript coding, with Twig and PHP at the template level</li>\n </ul>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  With Bear Group, you will tackle technical problems, code and debug primarily PHP/javascript/css, and occasionally participate in client meetings. You will need to be self-motivating and able to work independently most of the time, but we have a friendly and capable team to collaborate with when you encounter obstacles. Since the technology world is constantly evolving, you’ll be expected to keep up with the current technologies and practices. To help with this, we provide an annual education stipend that can be used for attending relevant conferences or continued education courses.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  During your first week you will work closely with one of our senior developers to set up your new system and familiarize with our processes and tools. The system will be either Mac, Linux, or Windows to your preference, and we use Vagrant to manage virtual machines for a consistent development server stack. Other tools you will use include:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Git for source control</li>\n  <li>Bitbucket for Git repositories</li>\n  <li>Jira for project management</li>\n  <li>Confluence for documentation</li>\n  <li>Slack for communication.</li>\n </ul>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  As you get your feet under you we will introduce some project work, again in collaboration with a senior developer on a sprint they are currently working on. Ultimately our developers work independently on your own tickets and sprints.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  In addition to competitive pay, a new computer, insurance, and 401k match, you’ll also receive:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>3 Weeks PTO plus approximately 10 vacation days annually</li>\n  <li>$1500 annual education stipend</li>\n  <li>Software stipend for the tools that you prefer to do the job</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  To learn more about the company, visit&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://www.beargroup.com/' rel='nofollow'>www.beargroup.com</a>. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n</div>",

Do you hate to compromise on code quality because of clients and deadlines? Then read on! \n  <br> \n  <br>We're a product-focused organization, which means our codebase is our baby; it can never become too perfect and we continually push our ambitions upwards. \n  <br>We're also the world's leading User Experience (UX) community—with over 1,5 million monthly visitors—and the biggest course platform for designers on the planet. Forbes Magazine has written about us and, what's more, we teach UX and Design to organizations like IBM and the British Parliament. We can offer you the freedom to shape your work schedule, as well as a priceless opportunity to make an impact on the world—you'll improve hundreds of thousands of lives each year. \n  <br> \n  <br>With that in mind, we'd love if you could help us take our codebase to the next level. \n  <br> \n  <br># Responsibilities \n  <br> You will join our team as a Senior Full-Stack Developer and your main responsibilities will be as follows: \n  <br>* Make principal architectural decisions together with back-end and front-end developers. \n  <br>* Communicate with our design team, write specifications for the components of the new [IDF Design System](https://s3.amazonaws.com/idfprofilepictures/hiring/IDF+Design+System+-+Proposal.pdf) and implement them. \n  <br>* Implement new features by writing readable, maintainable and testable code (using Laravel and/or Vanilla JS/Vue.js). \n  <br>* Reuse and improve existing solutions and components. \n  <br>* Write automated tests for critical parts of your code. What's more: We are TDD friendly! \n  <br>* Adopt the codebase as your baby and constantly refactor it towards perfection. \n  <br> \n  <br>**A future-proof tech stack** \n  <br>* We use the latest stable version of PHP7 because it increasingly offers features like strict type declarations. \n  <br>* We leverage the elegance, simplicity and readability of the latest Laravel version and features. \n  <br>* We want to spend our precious time on things that matter the most; that's why we perfect our easy to run development environment with Docker, VM and custom scripts. \n  <br>* We empower our automated tests with PHPUnit and Laravel Dusk. \n  <br>* We support evergreen browsers only (ES2015+, grid layout, CSS custom variables, etc). \n  <br>* We constantly refactor our front-end code with the goal to reach front-end heaven: \n  <br>1.&nbsp;**VanillaJS**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Vue.js**&nbsp;for its simplicity and flexibility that comes with a very small size and great performance. \n  <br>1.&nbsp;**PostCSS**&nbsp;to maximize the power of modern CSS. \n  <br>1.&nbsp;**Webpack**&nbsp;for perfect control over front-end assets. \n  <br>1.&nbsp;**Cypress.io**&nbsp;and Jest for automated tests. \n  <br>1.&nbsp;**PWA**&nbsp;with offline experience. \n  <br>* Mixed multi-page application and single-page (for the most interactive parts). \n  <br>* We️ ❤️ CI (Continuous Integration) and CD (Continuous Delivery) so we usually deploy a few releases per day: Zero downtime. Just a few buttons to push. No sweaty palms. \n  <br>* We care about Developer Experience (DX) of our codebase and tools. DX and DevOps is our middle name: git, GitHub, Docker, HTTP2, CDN, AWS and much more.&nbsp;** \n  <br> \n  <br>**Work conditions** \n  <br>* 100% remote full-time work with team trips 1-2 times a year in different places on the planet. \n  <br>* Flexible work schedule with minimal meetings. \n  <br>* Team of true professionals and smooth onboarding process with a personal mentor. \n  <br>* A culture of learning and excellence: \n  <br>1. In our code reviews, we constructively reference [specific evergreen principles](https://github.com/InteractionDesignFoundation/handbook/blob/master/library/front-end/clean-code-js.md) of programming to supercharge our learning. \n  <br>1. We actively use a library of evergreen literature on [front-end](https://github.com/InteractionDesignFoundation/handbook/blob/master/library/front-end/literature.md) and [back-end](https://github.com/InteractionDesignFoundation/handbook/blob/master/library/back-end/literature.md) development-related subjects. \n  <br>1. We believe that building timeless knowledge enables us to see through the hype and focus on what really matters. \n  <br> \n  <br># Requirements \n  <br>* You have expert knowledge of PHP. \n  <br>* You have 6+ years of experience working professionally with OOP + MVC (preferably web technologies). \n  <br>* Your work is based on a solid foundation in computer science fundamentals from data structures and algorithms to design patterns. \n  <br>* You have substantial experience working with RESTful web services and ORM concepts. \n  <br>* You love to learn through doing. You’re ready to put in some hard work to expand your skills. \n  <br>* You speak and write to an acceptable level of English. \n  <br>* You are a team player and you don't bring your ego to work. \n  <br>* You are self-motivated and self-disciplined and thus work well in a flat hierarchy with lots of freedom. \n  <br>* You love to have creative freedom, make independent judgments and live up to the responsibility that comes with that freedom. \n  <br>* You love to make a positive impact on the world and the lives of others. \n  <br> \n  <br>#Location \n  <br>- Worldwide \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

We're a dynamic team of practicing professionals, researchers, and scholars, with a passion to help students reach their academic and career goals. We often go above and beyond to deliver the best possible services we can for our students. We take our own medicine and we are constantly training to keep our individual performance and the performance of our company exceptional.</p>\n <p>In addition, we are also creating the next generation of university admissions screening software to reduce the social, racial and economic bias while being able to select better-suited applicants AND save time and money for universities and employers.</p>\n <p>We take our role very seriously and contribute to our company on a regular basis whether we work part-time or full-time because we understand the long-term impact of our work. We know how to manage our time and competing demands. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our services and impact and we are not afraid to share our ideas and collaborate with our team members.</p>\n <p>We put our company and our missions first before our own personal needs and desires. This is not a &quot;job&quot; to us. This is a calling. Our passion for mentoring our students and making admissions fair and scientifically sound is what gets us up in the morning. Importantly, we understand that our company is only as great as its individual members. That's how we have become a leading academic consulting firm and that's why we are extremely selective about our team and only pick the very best to join us and we do everything we can to support them.</p>\n <p><strong>We'll be honest; working at BeMo isn't for everyone.</strong></p>\n <p>If you are resistant to learn more and continuous coaching because you believe you already know everything about programming, if you are seeking a side job just to make a few bucks, or to add another entry to your resume, if you normally don't pay much attention to detail and your code is always returned by end users full of bugs, or if you are looking for a short-term gig with little impact and growth, then we're probably not right for you.</p>\n <p></p>\n <p>If you are a fantastic developer with great attention to detail, yet extremely humble, willing to learn more and are not afraid to explore topics that are not your expertise, love to be a part of the team to change the future of higher education and admissions screening, and looking for a long-term mission with significant impact on society, then you need to apply. Now.</p>\n <p><strong>What we offer:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Be a part of our fast growing, innovative and leading academic consulting firm.</li>\n  <li>Be part of a revolution. We are creating the next generation of candidate selection tools that are light years ahead at selecting best-suited candidates compared to traditional tools, while being fair to applicants.</li>\n  <li>Be part of a team of A-players. We only hire the brightest individuals with the highest caliber, character and courage.</li>\n  <li>Freedom to choose your hours. We don't believe in 9-5.

We share a love of tech, design, and business, and a gung-ho urge to zag when everyone else zigs. All of us care deeply about our work and our partners in that work. This gutsy, authentic approach makes us a great fit for eCommerce retailers throughout the country. \n  <br>Gauge has grown steadily since 2007, and we are poised to shift into high gear in 2017. We take the long-term view, both in-house and with our clients, so we need someone organized, proactive, and adventurous. If you daydream about what it could look like to build a web company that team members and clients want to partner with for decades, we would love to talk with you. We hope you are ready to be a major part of building the culture and creative process here at Gauge. \n  <br>We are based in a modern office in sunny Savannah, GA, but we have remote team members up and down the East Coast. This Account Management position is open to both on-site and remote candidates. \n  <br>Our Team \n  <br>Gauge is a special place, thanks to the dedicated, ambitious, down-to-earth, and geeky people who make up our team. All of us truly invest in the clients and team members we work with. Whether were in the office launching a new site or heading to Forsyth park to play some soccer, each day holds some fun. We want people who share our passion for creativity, business, and technology. \n  <br>Our Clients \n  <br>Our clients are people with dreams, families, and most of all, stories. Many have built their businesses from nothing. They are the salt of the earth and they come from many different industries. We have the pleasure of helping them tell their stories in a powerful, compelling way. If we do our job right, theyll get to hire more people, help more of their customers, and put their kids through college. \n  <br>We dont forget that there are people behind the email addresses we see everyday. They are motivated, interesting, and trusting, and we have built friendships as weve done business over the years. These long-term relationships and creative partnerships add up to make our job incredibly rewarding. \n  <br> \n  <br>Your Position \n  <br>As a Magento Developer, your primary focus will be building and maintaining outstanding eCommerce sites on the Magento platform.

In-depth knowledge and fluency in Magento 2 is a must; experience working with a development team is important. The Gauge dev team works together to solve problems, learn from each other, and build the best products we possibly can. If we were musicians, wed be an orchestra or jam band, not a group of separate rock stars. If thats exciting to you, we want to talk! \n  <br>We have a wide variety of clients from a wide variety of industries. Our services include both big implementations and ongoing maintenance services. Most client communication is channeled through Project &amp; Account Managers, but sometimes youll need to speak directly with clients. The ability to do so in a friendly, accessible, polished way is vital. \n  <br>Were all about learning and growing, so youll be actively involved in both sharing your Magento expertise and learning from your fellow team members. Youll be expected to hone your technical expertise and to build your management and leadership skills over time. We actively support this growth by providing resources, time, and a growth-oriented environment. We promote from within and reward initiative. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Key Tasks &amp; Responsibilities \n  <br> * Work successfully with our team to help our clients grow their businesses \n  <br> * Develop and maintain custom Magento 2 sites, modules, and integrations \n  <br> * Research, install, and configure various Magento 2 Extensions \n  <br> * Actively learn and develop your skills, and help cross-train development team members \n  <br> * Contribute to internal projects and code libraries, develop reusable snippets, and be actively involved in planning \n  <br> * Collaborate with other team members, clients, and partners \n  <br> * Work in a command line environment to perform automated tasks \n  <br> * Update clients about project details during active projects, and help educate clients on the platform and web technology \n  <br> * Develop documentation for code, standards, and workflow \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Benefits \n  <br> \n  <br> * Paid Time Off: (eligible after 60 days) 20 vacation days, 9 predetermined holidays, generous sick leave \n  <br> * Insurance: (eligible after 60 days) United Medical 50% paid by Gauge for employees; Life insurance 100% paid by Gauge for employees; Optional coverage for Dental, Vision, Short-term &amp; Long-term Disability, and Supplemental Insurance; Spouse, dependent, &amp; family coverage available for most options \n  <br> * Retirement: (eligible after 1 year) SimpleIRA with dollar-for-dollar matching funds, up to 3% of annual salary \n  <br> * Growth: A company-wide focus on professional development, including paid certifications and learning initiatives, on-the-clock learning time, company book clubs, and more \n  <br> * Tons of other perks, like open, transparent leadership, no-bull no-politics culture, team social times, awesome equipment, and more \n  <br> \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

    "content": "<h3>PHP Engineer at <span>SkyVerge</span></h3>\n<div>\n <span><i></i> Remote</span> \n</div>\n<div> \n <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><br>Howdy<br>We’re the folks at SkyVerge, and we build WordPress plugins that help over 100k+ eCommerce businesses grow and manage their WooCommerce stores. <strong>Our team is 100% remote, with 27 people distributed all over the world.</strong></p>\n <p>We’re looking for a driven, experienced, full-stack PHP Engineer to join our growing engineering team and build new features while maintaining our existing portfolio of 60+ individual extensions.</p>\n <p><strong>The Role</strong></p>\n <p>You’ll focus on building new features and maintaining existing code, while also helping with code reviews and customer support. With over 60 different plugins, there’s a wide variety of work. You might spend time on some complicated frontend interactions using JS, then switch focus to working with a tricky external REST API for a while, and later work on adding unit/acceptance tests to our framework code.</p>\n <p>You’ll have the opportunity to really dive into a problem and understand it before crafting a well-engineered, high quality solution. We believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time to think and code.</p>\n <p>Our plugins are built on top of WordPress and designed to work with WooCommerce, so we use PHP 5.3+ (moving soon to PHP 5.6 minimum) and we write all new JS in ES6. We follow a superset of the WordPress coding standards and actively invest in tooling &amp; testing to improve both the quality of our products and the happiness of our team building them.</p>\n <p>We work primarily through GitHub and Slack, so you should be able to clearly express your ideas via comments and messages. All new code is tested and peer-reviewed, so you’ll be able to both learn from the rest of the team and share your knowledge.</p>\n <p>As one of our senior engineers, the team will look to you for advice and direction. You’ll help shape our best practices, decide on libraries &amp; tooling, and refactor older or underperforming parts of the codebase. You’ll also be responsible for moving your projects forward, communicating your progress and milestones with others, and clearly documenting your work.</p>\n <p><strong>Here are some things you may do on a given day:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Research and write a pitch to refactor the data model for our shipping extension</li>\n  <li>Refactor an underperforming class after profiling it in your local environment</li>\n  <li>Troubleshoot an issue with our Memberships plugin by deep-diving into the content restriction class</li>\n  <li>Analyze a slow SQL query and suggest ways to improve it</li>\n  <li>Construct a detailed, multi-step data migration to move data from a custom post type to a custom table, write unit tests for it, and manually user test / QA it.</li>\n  <li>Review a pull request from another team member for readability, maintainability, and adherence to standards, and provide suggested improvements</li>\n  <li>Review new API documentation for one of our integration plugins and draft a story to upgrade to it</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>On the first day you will:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Meet your team and get familiar with how we work</li>\n  <li>Setup your local environment and tooling</li>\n  <li>Commit a small tweak to a plugin and open a pull request for peer review</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>In the first week you will:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Develop, QA, review, and ship a small feature improvement</li>\n  <li>Participate in code review for a teammate’s code</li>\n  <li>Help a team member with fixing a bug</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>In the first month you will:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Work closely with the product team to ship a large feature</li>\n  <li>Participate in your first support rotation week and help our support team with escalated issues</li>\n  <li>Handle deploying a set of plugin releases using our internal tools</li>\n  <li>Publish a retrospective on your first large project to share successes &amp; planned improvements for the next project</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong><br>You</p>\n <p>You love solving engineering challenges in the most pragmatic way possible. You write code that’s clear, readable, and standards-compliant. More importantly, you keep the end user in mind and love getting feedback from customers to help improve our products.</p>\n <p>Finally, you can’t wait to join a small team that loves their work as much as you do, affords the opportunity to work on challenging &amp; interesting projects, continuously learn and improve, and constantly ship your work. You’re an excellent writer and can communicate effectively whether drafting up a bug report, chatting in Slack, editing a wiki page, or drafting a retrospective. You know that code is about communication and explaining your thought process clearly goes hand-in-hand.</p>\n <p>Our team is fully-remote and we communicate primarily through Slack, Clubhouse, Google Docs, Basecamp, and weekly stand-ups via Zoom (a few short meetings) — we believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time that’s free of distractions.</p>\n <p><strong>As a remote team, we believe that regular meetups are invaluable for getting to know each other better, so you should be available for 1-2 company-paid team trips per year. </strong>Curious about what those are like? Check out our recap of our last team retreat (SkyTrip), which brought the entire team out to Scotland for a week! It’s a plus if you think (like we do) that bears are absolutely the coolest animals in the forest.</p>\n <p>This is a <strong>full-time, salaried position</strong>, but hours are flexible. We know your work will speak for itself with commits, issues closed, and wiki edits.</p>\n <p><strong>Process</strong></p>\n <p>After an initial screening, you’ll get an email with a few questions to answer. Following that, you’ll have a few 45 minute phone chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company.</p>\n <p>The most qualified candidates will then be invited to complete a short one-day research project. If this goes well, we’ll invite you to the final stage of our evaluation process: the trial project. During this ~2 week period, you’ll work closely with your future manager, as well as a few other team members, as a paid contractor to implement your proposal from the research project. You’ll be welcomed in Slack, introduced to any team members you may be working with, and will have regular chats with your future manager to share feedback and make sure all is going well.</p>\n <p>Already working full time? Don’t worry! We design the trial project assuming someone already has a full-time job. We won’t ask you to work crazy hours, and we keep your project scoped accordingly. This brief trial period is a great way for you to make sure you enjoy the work and the team, and it also gives us an opportunity to do the same. At the end of the period, assuming a great experience for all, you’ll be offered a full-time position Then the real fun and full onboarding experience will begin!</p>\n <p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Here are some benefits we’re happy to offer to our team members:</li>\n  <li>Competitive salary</li>\n  <li>Annual incentive for meeting team and company goals</li>\n  <li>27 days of paid time-off, in addition to 2 company holidays (SkyVerge Day in March, Founders Day in June)</li>\n  <li>Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance for US and Canadian residents and their families (reimbursements for comparable care for non-US/Canadian residents)</li>\n  <li>401k/RRSP Retirement plan with 4% company match for US/Canadian residents (contributions to comparable plans for non-US/Canadian residents)</li>\n  <li>Up to 8 weeks paid parental leave for new parents</li>\n  <li>Work flexible hours from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection</li>\n  <li>Tools (hardware/software) to help you be productive</li>\n  <li>Allowance for professional growth (books, courses, conferences)</li>\n  <li>Home office or co-working allowance</li>\n  <li>A Kindle to help you keep learning</li>\n </ul>\n <p>We support workplace diversity and do not discriminate on any protected class. We believe when we work together as a team of different views, experiences, and ideas, we can build amazing things.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://skyverge.workable.com/jobs/1070902' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

Rebilly is a Teal Organization, meaning our organizational structure may differ than what you’re used to, but we think you’ll be pleasantly surprised. In a very tiny nutshell, this means that as an organization we value self-management, self-organization, as well as the wholeness of the individuals that make up our team (meaning you should be yourself at work, and do the work that inspires you.)

Rebilly’s comprehensive feature set is built to help our merchants get more of their customers from the order form to the thank you page, and more renewals paid. We took lessons learned from years of experience in the subscription business and millions of subscribers and applied them to make our payment system clever, flexible, and easy to use for our clients.",

We raised a Series A from Stripe and Visa and are a growing team of 77 friends (21 engineers) with a mission to accelerate digital commerce in one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.</p>\n<p>We're expanding across Africa and have people from as far as Canada, France, and Turkey. We help relocate anyone interested to where our offices are, but we're also determined about remote. Due to rapid growth, half of us are remote today.</p>\n<p>One specific occasion we do require our people to be present at is our quarterly off-site. Four times a year, we fly you in for an extended weekend of jam-packed fun and company-wide check-in, and should you opt for extending your stay a little bit, we host you at our guest house or a sweet hotel. Here’re a few photos from our Q3 offsite (<a href='https://bit.ly/2GkPcZx' rel='nofollow'>https://bit.ly/2GkPcZx</a>)</p>\n<p>We enjoy a close relationship with some of the most interesting technology companies in the world. GitHub CEO Nat Friedman recently swung by our Lagos office (<a href='https://bit.ly/2xLmGLy' rel='nofollow'>https://bit.ly/2xLmGLy</a>) and we also hosted teams from Stripe (<a href='https://bit.ly/2XGxK7m' rel='nofollow'>https://bit.ly/2XGxK7m</a>)</p>\n<p>Our engineering has independent infrastructure, frontend, and (multiple) backend teams that work closely with product, growth, and business. We deploy JavaScript on AWS, data on MySQL, maintain some legacy PHP alongside small Java services.</p>\n<p>We're making great efforts to modularize and improve the quality of our codebases on a quest to embrace asynchronous processing and independent microservices on cloud-agnostic infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We're very proud of our product, and we made a promise to ourselves to make our codebase a thing of envy.</p>\n<p>So here's what we need; people better than us in every way.</p>\n<p>We're a tight bunch of curious people hungry for experienced colleagues to take us to the next level. We crave highly skilled, kind teammates who hold themselves to high standards, and care as fiercely as we do about pursuing collective growth and learning.</p>\n<p>A challenge to build a payments growth engine for an entire continent does not come often. It's an especially interesting time to join Paystack.</p>\n<p>Our hiring is not very conventional and we try to personalize it. We mainly rely on working together on a sample, fictitious project. We'll recognize experience, insatiable curiosity, and an immense passion for sharing.</p>\n<p>My name is Serkan. I myself have joined Paystack only 8 months ago when we were less than 35 people and have been leading engineering for the past 3 months from my home in Turkey. Please don't hesitate to reach me at serkan@paystack.com and let's begin chatting.</p>",

You want to work in a small but expanding technology start-up environment where everything you do has a big impact on customers, clients and our product offering.\n<br>\n<br>What You’ll Do\n<br>\n<br>The role will be incredibly varied, but you can expect to:\n<br>\n<br>• Manage and automate build, test and deployment pipelines\n<br>• Develop tooling to help the development team work faster\n<br>• Deliver customer-facing features on our website and mobile app\n<br>• Deliver features that help our customer service and operations teams\n<br>• Provide support when things go wrong or don’t work as expected\n<br>\n<br>Joining us will give you a wide range of experience across the full software development lifecycle, and you'll make an important contribution to your team.\n<br>\n<br>Where You’ll Be Based\n<br> \n<br>We have an office on Southbank in London, but you’ll have the option to work remotely for a majority of the time. How much you need to be in the office can vary over time depending on what we’re trying to get done.\n<br>\n<br>Interview Process\n<br>\n<br>1. Phone chat with the CTO to answer your questions about the role and the company\n<br>2. In person interview to discuss code you’ve written and problems you’ve solved\n<br>\n<br>Smarterly is an equal opportunities employer, and our inclusive team welcomes colleagues from all backgrounds.

We use Slack for regular communication and Basecamp for project management. There are occasionally some video chats we’ll need to do.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>JOB BENEFITS:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>You can work from anywhere.</strong> No moving for a job involved. If you’re happy where you are, stay there. If you’re unhappy, move somewhere new. This job will go with you. (If you want to spend a month working from the Italian countryside or in a Scottish pub, more power to you.)</li>\n  <li>You decide what you want your hours to be, though we do need someone who has good availability during standard business hours for projects. You also need to communicate with the team regularly.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>SKILLS &amp; REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You should have a good understanding of WordPress, CSS, PHP and Javascript. Ideally you’ve worked with Woocommerce and know how to use Advanced Custom Fields.</li>\n  <li>This position is great for someone who is looking for experience to learn more and become a better developer, as well as be part a team that will support and encourage you. You may have a background in graphic design (not required), but you most certainly have a good eye for design.</li>\n  <li><strong>You should be able to handle at least 12-20 hours of work per week to start. </strong>Many of our contractors have opted to become full-time employees or dedicated contractors in time.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>who we are</strong></p>\n <p>Alchemy+Aim is a website development company, specializing in helping thought leaders, entrepreneurs and creative business owners. In five years, we’ve gone from solopreneurship to a company of 12 people.</p>\n <p>We’re doing things differently at Alchemy+Aim, focusing on building lateral structures in the company rather than traditional hierarchical ones. Team members have all the perks that contractors have, while also being able to really contribute to the growth of the company and the direction it’s moving in. We believe that when we work and grow together, we can accomplish great things.</p>\n <p><strong>are you the right fit?</strong></p>\n <p><strong>This position IS for you if:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You believe the best code is clean, simple, and well-organized.</li>\n  <li>You are detailed oriented and meticulous.</li>\n  <li>You get projects done on time (or early).</li>\n  <li>You are honest and have no tolerance for drama.</li>\n  <li>You are empathetic and humble.</li>\n  <li>You are steady and reliable, and take your responsibilities seriously.</li>\n  <li>You like following a system, but also speak up when you have ideas about how the system can be improved.</li>\n  <li>You can adapt to situations as they arise.</li>\n  <li>You like troubleshooting, solving problems, and learning new things.</li>\n  <li>You like working on projects for soulful and creative entrepreneurs.</li>\n  <li>You can commit to the position for at least nine months.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Our ideal candidate is a developer who has a strong aesthetic eye and the ability to make the backend of a site intuitive so the non-savvy user feels comfortable, confident, and well taken care of.</p>\n <p><strong>This position IS NOT for you if:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You are repeatedly late getting work done.</li>\n  <li>You dislike or have problems with regular communication.</li>\n  <li>You often miss details.</li>\n  <li>You are rigid and unable to accept feedback.</li>\n  <li>You cannot adapt to new systems or ways of doing things.</li>\n  <li>You think that a 28px margin is the same thing as a 25px margin. Or that Helvetica is the same thing as Open Sans.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>You will be paid on an hourly basis, every two weeks.</strong></p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://alchemyandaim.com/the-team/apply/developer-with-design-eye/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</strong>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We don’t work like that.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We get how important growth is for developers.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)?

Get Expert Guidance</strong>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</strong>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.\n  <span><br></span>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.</span>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>Here’s What We Expect From You…</strong>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>You’re excellent at PHP&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP&nbsp;<br></li>\n  <li>You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>You want to participate in scrum teamwork&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>You have an excellent attention to detail&nbsp;</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <span><br></span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

    "content": "What’s the Big Opportunity?This is your opportunity to join our team of 50+ to help us build a state-of-the-art B2C e-commerce platform and brand from the comfort of your own home for a rapidly scaling, profitable, 8-figure company.We’re fully hitting our stride in the exploding $250+ billion health and wellness field. And this is your chance to help make a meaningful impact on the lives of people who struggle with their health by accelerating our ability to penetrate this market with our robust product offerings (see more below).To that end, our goal is to build the first billion-dollar brand that’s 100% remote… and need your help.To summarize the key points:* Salary: $110,000 - $140,000* Location: 100% Remote* Benefits: Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k* Hours: 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 (and very flexible)* Culture: High-Performance but Humble (no jerks)Who are We Looking For?A full-time, senior, full-stack, brilliant, business-savvy web architect / web developer with heavy big data experience in the direct-to-consumer e-commerce space. It’s a full-time, 100% remote position with a flexible work/vacation schedule as lifestyle is hugely important to our company.A curious mind, desire for autonomy while excelling in an open, truly collaborative culture of high performers makes would make you a perfect fit. These aren’t talking points. This is what we do, now.We’re on pace to double this year and repeat that next year. To that end, we need more help tackling some very big engineering projects so we can handle our next leg of growth. We’re laser-focused on recruiting someone with a business mindset who loves to solve big business problems by developing beautiful, efficient code and who enjoys having immediate, visible influence on the company’s results.The ideal person is extremely results-driven and gets tremendous satisfaction from having their work see the light of day quickly… and being motivated by seeing the impact it has. We want someone of who obsesses about and loves to code… but also someone who loves to solve big business problems.Projects include everything from handling the massive system and data load that spending $1,000,000+ monthly on paid advertising brings, to building automated workflow tools to streamline internal operations, to developing sophisticated if/then logic in our billing code to handle the creative pricing and offers we use in our customer acquisition funnels.For example, we built our own all-in-one e-commerce system in 2012 as nothing handled the complex billing and funnel logic we needed to support our sophisticated B2C marketing strategies. However, now we’re moving over to the Shopify platform and strategically integrating our existing platform. That requires a complex analysis on which system does which part the best and building a smart integration.As another example, we build our own custom dashboards to precisely track our advertising efforts. To that end, we integrate with Google and Facebook’s APIs to ingest all the data they provide. As a result, we end up with millions of rows of data a month that needs to be efficiently organized so we can use our BI tool to extract key business insights effectively.The ideal person is extremely self-motivated, loves to grind out work consistently and is comfortable being hands-on in all facets of web engineering from the browser-to-the-code-to-the-server. Experience with marketing funnels, e-commerce systems, split testing, sales analytics, conversion rate optimization is essential.We empower our developers with a lot of autonomy and responsibility for some very meaty projects that have very large $ impacts. To that end, this opportunity is suited only for a high-performing full-stack developer with an integrative mindset and proven ability to get things done cleanly and on time. You will work hand-in-hand with our CTO to optimize, support and manage our entire web infrastructure. You and our two other senior devs form our core development team of 4, covering for each other as vacation and other needs arise, while working synergistically on separate projects.Just as we obsess about creating metabolism-optimizing products that get the most results in the least time, we’re looking for someone equally obsessed about doing the same thing with efficient code.While your coding skills are important, it's how fast you process information, how quickly (and accurately) you can cycle through work and how well you work with the rest of our team that's crucial. To that end, communication is key to this role, as is the ability to self-motivate and quickly turn a business conversation into an actionable set of dev tasks that you can jump on immediately.Who is This Opportunity Perfect for?Anybody who truly is a top coder and creative architect who might relate to any of these:If you’re tired of the commute, sick of burning the midnight oil, stress is dominating your life, and the cost of real estate is eating up your retirement, this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction.Or, if you’ve always wanted to be a part of the thrill of a rapidly growing company, but didn’t want to move to an expensive big city with all the madness, stress and high cost that brings, this is your opportunity to stay where you are (or move to where you always wanted to go) to design your ideal life.Or, if you’re drowning in the corporate world, suffocating from constantly shifting priorities that nobody agrees on, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get work done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep – to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity… and scale it like never before. Regardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day… AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we can’t wait to meet you.Who Are We and What’s the Company’s Background?Our mission is to spread our metabolism-first way of living we’ve been busy perfecting for 8 years to a worldwide audience. It’s a lifestyle that’s 100% focused on getting you the results that matter: looking your best, feeling your best and doing your best. In the shortest time possible. And in a way that sticks.That’s why our tag line is “Life’s Short. Make it Count.” It puts you back in control. It empowers you to fix your own problems. And it makes you want to tell the world about it.Our vision is to do this by becoming a billion-dollar multi-channel brand that’s distributed via online, mobile and physical retail. We’ve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework and high-performance culture to make this happen. And now we’re ready for a much larger stage.We’ve built a full ecosystem of products and services that allow someone to live a metabolism-first lifestyle. This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods and membership programs. We’re launching a mobile app next year, then will push into offline retail, extend into home-delivered meals and more. But ONE thing at a time, just like we’ve done for 8 years.Our next major step is rolling out our new Metabolic Living brand and centralized e-commerce website at www.metabolicliving.com, using highly customized Shopify implementation, by September. As part of this, we will sunset our old brand, Natural Health Sherpa, and consolidate our various product-driven microsites like at www.metabolicrenewal.com.So why is a metabolism-first lifestyle needed? Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up in virtually every country. Why is that? Because we’re over-worked, over-stressed, over-fed and toxic. And we’re deprived of the sleep, nutrition, exercise, movement and relaxation we need to thrive. That’s a recipe for disaster. And we’re seeing it.Unfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise trap people into a 1-step-forward-2-steps back vicious cycle that actually makes them worse off. They bounce around from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making any progress… staying trapped in a downward spiral.Rigid philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create an us-vs-them tribal mentality that’s self-limiting. Neither of those philosophies work for all people all the time… or even the same person all the time. People differ. People change. If that’s not respected, things will backfire.We, on the other hand, present a framework that allows you to customize your life in a way that works best for you, so you can reach your fullest metabolic potential. Because we’ve found through working with millions of people that a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results you want.Instead of fighting against your body or your life, we empower you to work with your body and life to create the perfect program for you. One that’s practical. One that’s sustainable. One that’s enjoyable. And, most importantly, one that delivers the results you want at any stage of life. And fast.And we practice what we preach: our company is designed so everyone on our team both enjoys their work challenges while having plenty of time to do what they most in their life. We recruit only high-performing, humble people who produce in fast cycles, hold themselves accountable and have fun. And we invest a TON into our team, mentoring, coaching, teaching high performance habits and more.What are the Requirements?* Deep experience as an end-to-end web application developer/web architect responsible for every single part of the project including requirements gathering, project management, system architecture, infrastructure setup, coding, integrating with 3rd parties, documenting and testing.* Heavy marketing-systems focus with deep experience in e-commerce, payment processing, split testing, funnel development, analytics, page speed optimization, API integrations, etc.* 10+ years’ experience as a software engineer/web developer with recent, applicable focus on database-driven web applications on a LAMP stack.* Expert-level, working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; our design team creates most of the assets, but you’ll be implementing, optimizing, troubleshooting, and adding functionality.* Ability to build complex PHP applications quickly, efficiently, and under pressure.

    "content": "Attention Senior Backend Developers:“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”You’ve finally found it…The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!But only if you keep reading.iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School1 - Solve Interesting ProblemsMost of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.2 - Work With A Clean CodebaseTell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”We don’t work like that.We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.3 - Endless Opportunities To GrowYou love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.We get how important growth is for developers.Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.4 - Get Expert GuidanceOur developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own TimeHave you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.6 - Work From Anywhere In The WorldWe understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.7 - Stability You Can Count OnMost startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your CodeHelping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.Here’s What We Expect From You…- You’re excellent at PHP - You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP - You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years - You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems - You want to participate in scrum teamwork - You have an excellent attention to detail Please only apply if you meet all these criteria. Other applications will not be considered.

We believe in change through accountability, debate, ambition and respect for the communities and individuals that make up our networked universe(s).&nbsp;</p>\n <p>Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to control a large group of people from the top down, which is why military organizations, industrial corporations and nation-states have relied on it so heavily. But hierarchies carry their own institutional costs, which means that a regulatory bureaucracy can focus only on a few issues at a time – generally those most important to the people at the top or to the dominant groups in the ruling coalition.</p>\n <p>But what if we can organize this company to embody the very structures of those network communication technologies and digital platforms we hope to build? What if this can enable us to take on all those dinosaur hierarchies as equals - and more than equals? What if self-regulation and social cooperation can be amplified and intensified in this way to empower all of us to care for our selves and ourselves without any authority?</p>\n <p>That’s why Mav Farm is&nbsp;stigmergic. Like the products we build, stigmergy is a form of self-organization social network. It's the principle that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergic networks are superior to hierarchies, in that they are not slowed down by bureaucratic permission-seeking, communication asymmetries and problems associated with top-down coordination. Instead stigmergy allows individual contributors or cells to freely work within a shared platform, contributing to a shared goal as they see fit.</p>\n <p>With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project. The innovations of individual contributors can freely travel throughout the chain when others wish to adopt them. Think of stigmergy as a heuristic approach to improving everything, allowing all of us to be agile and flexible.</p>\n <p>This is our shorthand way of saying that we don’t have any management, and nobody “reports to” anybody else. We do have Founders, but even they aren't your manager. This company is yours to steer—toward opportunities and away from risks, toward high performance and quick creative fixes. You have the power to green-light projects. You have the power to ship products.</p>\n <p>In this stigmergic structure every organizational barrier is removed between your work and the customer enjoying that work. Every company will tell you that “the customer is boss,” but here that statement has weight. There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what our customers want, and then giving it to them.</p>\n <p>So far, our team has designed, architected and built things like: motion tracking in video, object recognition in video, machine learning recommender systems, real-time graphics shaders, AR shopping experiences, business intelligence dashboards, marketplace apps, video streaming apps and more. Our sights are set high! Where will you take us?</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Full medical, dental and vision</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Retirement/401K Plan</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Unlimited PTO</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible schedules</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Life &amp; Disability coverage</span> </li> \n</ul>",

You will have the opportunity to work with leading companies and marketing teams to develop complex sites and integrations between systems.</p>\n <p>We are a fully distributed team that primarily builds in PHP on the Magento and Drupal platforms for ecommerce and content management sites. Since we are fully remote, you can work from anywhere! We do require at least 4 hours of working time overlap with the Pacific time zone work day where most of our clients are located. As a highly client focused organization, you will occasionally need to meet according to their schedule. This typically falls between 10 and 5 Pacific time, and we strive to give you plenty of time to focus on development.</p>\n <p>Working with a variety of clients, we fluidly form groups including a Technical Project Manager, a Quality Analyst, and one or more developers to complete sprints of work. The type of work depends on the client, but often includes:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Developing custom modules and extensions for Drupal CMS and Magento Commerce.</li>\n  <li>Integration with various APIs and third-party systems.</li>\n  <li>Migrating existing sites to modern platforms.</li>\n  <li>Knowledgeable with front-end development: HTML/CSS/Javascript coding, with Twig and PHP at the template level</li>\n </ul>\n <p>With Bear Group, you will tackle technical problems, code and debug primarily PHP/javascript/css, and occasionally participate in client meetings. You will need to be self-motivating and able to work independently most of the time, but we have a friendly and capable team to collaborate with when you encounter obstacles. Since the technology world is constantly evolving, you’ll be expected to keep up with the current technologies and practices. To help with this, we provide an annual education stipend that can be used for attending relevant conferences or continued education courses.</p>\n <p>During your first week you will work closely with one of our senior developers to set up your new system and familiarize with our processes and tools. The system will be either Mac, Linux, or Windows to your preference, and we use Vagrant to manage virtual machines for a consistent development server stack. Other tools you will use include:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Git for source control</li>\n  <li>Bitbucket for Git repositories</li>\n  <li>Jira for project management</li>\n  <li>Confluence for documentation</li>\n  <li>Slack for communication.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>As you get your feet under you we will introduce some project work, again in collaboration with a senior developer on a sprint they are currently working on. Ultimately our developers work independently on your own tickets and sprints.</p>\n <p>In addition to competitive pay, a new computer, insurance, and 401k match, you’ll also receive:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>3 Weeks PTO plus approximately 10 vacation days annually</li>\n  <li>$1500 annual education stipend</li>\n  <li>Software stipend for the tools that you prefer to do the job</li>\n </ul>\n <p><br>To learn more about the company, visit&nbsp;<a href='http://www.beargroup.com/' rel='nofollow'>www.beargroup.com</a>. We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://bear-group.breezy.hr/p/166f4c46e1b6-web-developer?source=stackoverflow' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>About Bear Group</h4> \n<div>\n <p>Bear Group was founded in Seattle in January 2007 on a passion for open source platforms— especially Drupal, and later Magento®—and their power to grow a business. Small businesses no longer have to license expensive software to get started, or depend on a webmaster to keep their sites up to date; large businesses are made more efficient with a rock-solid CMS and e-commerce platform that don’t require the development or management of proprietary platforms.</p>\n <p>Since Bear Group opened, we have been able to help companies grow their business in many different ways. Sometimes it’s by creating a new sales channel by opening an online store-- or driving sales by vastly improving an existing one. Sometimes it’s by developing a more professional, authoritative web presence, or building a site that’s ready for search engine marketing. Sometimes it’s by empowering a business to manage its own site so it can keep it fresh and ensure that customers have a reason to visit. And sometimes it’s in the cost savings of making a web business so much more efficient.</p>\n <p>We work with clients ranging in size and representing many different industries. My own background is a mix of technology and business (Computer Science degree as an undergrad, followed by an MBA), and I’ve worked as a founding member of three startups as well as on 200+ marketing/technology projects for Microsoft. So I enjoy the challenges of both a new business and a larger, more established one, and I like to look at growth potential holistically.</p> \n</div>",
