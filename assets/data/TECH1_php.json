How much you need to be in the office can vary over time depending on what we’re trying to get done.<br /><br />Interview Process<br /><br />1. Phone chat with the CTO to answer your questions about the role and the company<br />2. In person interview to discuss code you’ve written and problems you’ve solved<br /><br />Smarterly is an equal opportunities employer, and our inclusive team welcomes colleagues from all backgrounds.

To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong>1. Solve Interesting Problems</strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Most of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.</div><div><br></div><div>We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>2. Work With A Clean Codebase</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div></div><div>Tell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>We don’t work like that.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>3. Endless Opportunities To Grow</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div></div><div>You love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>We get how important growth is for developers.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.<span><br></span></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><strong>4. Get Expert Guidance</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Our developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>5. Stay In Control Over Your Own Time</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Have you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>6. Work From Anywhere In The World</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>We understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>7. Stability You Can Count On</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Most startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.<span><br></span></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><strong>8. Millions Of People Will Use Your Code</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div>Helping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Here’s What We Expect From You…</strong><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><strong><br></strong></div><ul><li>You’re excellent at PHP&nbsp;</li><li>You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP&nbsp;<br></li><li>You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years&nbsp;</li><li>You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems&nbsp;</li><li>You want to participate in scrum teamwork&nbsp;</li><li>You have an excellent attention to detail&nbsp;</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Please only apply if you meet all these criteria.

    "content": "What’s the Big Opportunity?This is your opportunity to join our team of 50+ to help us build a state-of-the-art B2C e-commerce platform and brand from the comfort of your own home for a rapidly scaling, profitable, 8-figure company.We’re fully hitting our stride in the exploding $250+ billion health and wellness field.  And this is your chance to help make a meaningful impact on the lives of people who struggle with their health by accelerating our ability to penetrate this market with our robust product offerings (see more below).To that end, our goal is to build the first billion-dollar brand that’s 100% remote… and need your help.To summarize the key points:* Salary: $110,000 - $140,000* Location: 100% Remote* Benefits: Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k* Hours: 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 (and very flexible)* Culture: High-Performance but Humble (no jerks)Who are We Looking For?A full-time, senior, full-stack, brilliant, business-savvy web architect / web developer with heavy big data experience in the direct-to-consumer e-commerce space.  It’s a full-time, 100% remote position with a flexible work/vacation schedule as lifestyle is hugely important to our company.A curious mind, desire for autonomy while excelling in an open, truly collaborative culture of high performers makes would make you a perfect fit.  These aren’t talking points.  This is what we do, now.We’re on pace to double this year and repeat that next year.  To that end, we need more help tackling some very big engineering projects so we can handle our next leg of growth.  We’re laser-focused on recruiting someone with a business mindset who loves to solve big business problems by developing beautiful, efficient code and who enjoys having immediate, visible influence on the company’s results.The ideal person is extremely results-driven and gets tremendous satisfaction from having their work see the light of day quickly… and being motivated by seeing the impact it has.  We want someone of who obsesses about and loves to code… but also someone who loves to solve big business problems.Projects include everything from handling the massive system and data load that spending $1,000,000+ monthly on paid advertising brings, to building automated workflow tools to streamline internal operations, to developing sophisticated if/then logic in our billing code to handle the creative pricing and offers we use in our customer acquisition funnels.For example, we built our own all-in-one e-commerce system in 2012 as nothing handled the complex billing and funnel logic we needed to support our sophisticated B2C marketing strategies.  However, now we’re moving over to the Shopify platform and strategically integrating our existing platform.  That requires a complex analysis on which system does which part the best and building a smart integration.As another example, we build our own custom dashboards to precisely track our advertising efforts.  To that end, we integrate with Google and Facebook’s APIs to ingest all the data they provide.  As a result, we end up with millions of rows of data a month that needs to be efficiently organized so we can use our BI tool to extract key business insights effectively.The ideal person is extremely self-motivated, loves to grind out work consistently and is comfortable being hands-on in all facets of web engineering from the browser-to-the-code-to-the-server.  Experience with marketing funnels, e-commerce systems, split testing, sales analytics, conversion rate optimization is essential.We empower our developers with a lot of autonomy and responsibility for some very meaty projects that have very large $ impacts.  To that end, this opportunity is suited only for a high-performing full-stack developer with an integrative mindset and proven ability to get things done cleanly and on time. You will work hand-in-hand with our CTO to optimize, support and manage our entire web infrastructure.  You and our two other senior devs form our core development team of 4, covering for each other as vacation and other needs arise, while working synergistically on separate projects.Just as we obsess about creating metabolism-optimizing products that get the most results in the least time, we’re looking for someone equally obsessed about doing the same thing with efficient code.While your coding skills are important, it's how fast you process information, how quickly (and accurately) you can cycle through work and how well you work with the rest of our team that's crucial.  To that end, communication is key to this role, as is the ability to self-motivate and quickly turn a business conversation into an actionable set of dev tasks that you can jump on immediately.Who is This Opportunity Perfect for?Anybody who truly is a top coder and creative architect who might relate to any of these:If you’re tired of the commute, sick of burning the midnight oil, stress is dominating your life, and the cost of real estate is eating up your retirement, this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction.Or, if you’ve always wanted to be a part of the thrill of a rapidly growing company, but didn’t want to move to an expensive big city with all the madness, stress and high cost that brings, this is your opportunity to stay where you are (or move to where you always wanted to go) to design your ideal life.Or, if you’re drowning in the corporate world, suffocating from constantly shifting priorities that nobody agrees on, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get work done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep – to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity… and scale it like never before. Regardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day… AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we can’t wait to meet you.Who Are We and What’s the Company’s Background?Our mission is to spread our metabolism-first way of living we’ve been busy perfecting for 8 years to a worldwide audience.  It’s a lifestyle that’s 100% focused on getting you the results that matter:  looking your best, feeling your best and doing your best. In the shortest time possible.  And in a way that sticks.That’s why our tag line is “Life’s Short.  Make it Count.”  It puts you back in control.  It empowers you to fix your own problems.  And it makes you want to tell the world about it.Our vision is to do this by becoming a billion-dollar multi-channel brand that’s distributed via online, mobile and physical retail.  We’ve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework and high-performance culture to make this happen.  And now we’re ready for a much larger stage.We’ve built a full ecosystem of products and services that allow someone to live a metabolism-first lifestyle.  This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods and membership programs.  We’re launching a mobile app next year, then will push into offline retail, extend into home-delivered meals and more.  But ONE thing at a time, just like we’ve done for 8 years.Our next major step is rolling out our new Metabolic Living brand and centralized e-commerce website at www.metabolicliving.com, using highly customized Shopify implementation, by September.  As part of this, we will sunset our old brand, Natural Health Sherpa, and consolidate our various product-driven microsites like at www.metabolicrenewal.com.So why is a metabolism-first lifestyle needed?  Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up in virtually every country.  Why is that?  Because we’re over-worked, over-stressed, over-fed and toxic.  And we’re deprived of the sleep, nutrition, exercise, movement and relaxation we need to thrive.  That’s a recipe for disaster.  And we’re seeing it.Unfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise trap people into a 1-step-forward-2-steps back vicious cycle that actually makes them worse off.  They bounce around from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making any progress… staying trapped in a downward spiral.Rigid philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create an us-vs-them tribal mentality that’s self-limiting.  Neither of those philosophies work for all people all the time… or even the same person all the time.  People differ.  People change.  If that’s not respected, things will backfire.We, on the other hand, present a framework that allows you to customize your life in a way that works best for you, so you can reach your fullest metabolic potential.  Because we’ve found through working with millions of people that a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results you want.Instead of fighting against your body or your life, we empower you to work with your body and life to create the perfect program for you.  One that’s practical.  One that’s sustainable.  One that’s enjoyable.  And, most importantly, one that delivers the results you want at any stage of life.  And fast.And we practice what we preach:  our company is designed so everyone on our team both enjoys their work challenges while having plenty of time to do what they most in their life.  We recruit only high-performing, humble people who produce in fast cycles, hold themselves accountable and have fun. And we invest a TON into our team, mentoring, coaching, teaching high performance habits and more.What are the Requirements?* Deep experience as an end-to-end web application developer/web architect responsible for every single part of the project including requirements gathering, project management, system architecture, infrastructure setup, coding, integrating with 3rd parties, documenting and testing.* Heavy marketing-systems focus with deep experience in e-commerce, payment processing, split testing, funnel development, analytics, page speed optimization, API integrations, etc.* 10+ years’ experience as a software engineer/web developer with recent, applicable focus on database-driven web applications on a LAMP stack.* Expert-level, working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; our design team creates most of the assets, but you’ll be implementing, optimizing, troubleshooting, and adding functionality.* Ability to build complex PHP applications quickly, efficiently, and under pressure.

    "content": "Attention Senior Backend Developers:“Skyrocket Your Career As A Developer In The Dream Work Environment – While Solving Interesting Problems And Working With A Clean Codebase”You’ve finally found it…The perfect work environment to skyrocket your career as a developer.If you’re a talented, experienced and ambitious backend developer, then this page could literally change your life!But only if you keep reading.iPhone Photography School is the world’s no. 1 online photography resource. To stay at the top, we need to be excellent at everything we do, including development.On the surface, our development needs look simple, but there's a lot more going on behind the scenes. In fact, our business is built on complex development solutions that we've created from scratch.Right now, we’re looking to expand our team with the best people so we can achieve even more.To attract the most capable developers like you, we’ve created the dream work environment for building your career.8 Reasons To Build Your Career As A Developer At iPhone Photography School1 - Solve Interesting ProblemsMost of our development solutions are built from scratch and are customized to our needs.This includes our payment and upsell system, our online learning platform and iOS app, and our proprietary algorithms that decide how millions of dollars are spent on Facebook ads.We have an AWS server set-up with load balancers, we use Docker and Circle CI for continuous integration, and we’ve got automated testing for everything.The point is, you’ll never be bored working here.2 - Work With A Clean CodebaseTell me if this sounds familiar to you: a nice piece of code you’re trying to push seems to be breaking a different part of the system. As you open the problematic code, the first words you utter are “Who the **** wrote this?”We don’t work like that.We spent all of 2017 to clean up our codebase and rarely will you find better-kept code. If we touch one part of the system, we make sure it still integrates perfectly with the rest.This long-term approach saves you a lot of frustration and lets you focus on the problem at hand.3 - Endless Opportunities To GrowYou love being a developer because you experience growth every single day. Each completed task comes with an exciting feeling that you’ve learned something new. This rush makes you want to jump on the next assignment and continue growing.We get how important growth is for developers.Want to master a new framework, tool or expand your skill set (e.g., learn about AI and deep learning)? Find the appropriate online course and we’ll pay for it.Want to use your new skills for real life solutions? We’ll encourage you to do it.4 - Get Expert GuidanceOur developers are ninjas. But we don’t expect them to know everything. Even the best developers sometimes need expert help to complete the most challenging tasks.If there’s something outside of our team’s comfort zone, we provide them with experienced mentors in the particular area.Besides that, you can always get help from other people on the team. They know how to achieve almost anything with code.Join our team, and you’ll get guidance from the top experts in the business.5 - Stay In Control Over Your Own TimeHave you ever experienced this situation: your boss angrily asks you about a feature that had to be launched already… while you had no clue it was a priority?You abandon all other tasks and end up working late in the evening to ship the feature – only for a new urgency to come up the next day... And this cycle repeats itself again and again.We do things a little differently. Because we use the scrum methodology, our developers know everything they’ll have to do in any given week in advance. And we stick to our plans.This means you can schedule your time however you want, as long as you get the job done.6 - Work From Anywhere In The WorldWe understand that the best developers like to work on their own terms. So you can do this job from anywhere in the world – including your home, our office in Latvia, or any paradise location!If the initial collaboration turns out to be successful, our company will pay for a week-long trip to Latvia where you’ll meet the rest of our team and get acquainted with our company culture.7 - Stability You Can Count OnMost startups have huge ambitions - and little or no revenue. If you've spent months or years of your life in an exciting new company that never really takes off, you already know how frustrating that can be.Rather than burning investor money, iPhone Photography School is highly profitable and our growth is funded from our own revenue. We had explosive growth last year, and we will 2X our business again in the next 12 months.You don't have to worry about the company running out of money.8 - Millions Of People Will Use Your CodeHelping others is one of the most rewarding things you can do in life. While this is something that everyone should practice in their daily life, you can also do it while earning a living.During the last 30 days alone our website has been visited by 2,063,297 different people, and this number is increasing rapidly as our impact continues to grow.Your work will help millions of people take better photos and capture the beauty of the world.Here’s What We Expect From You…- You’re excellent at PHP - You’ve worked with Laravel, Rest APIs and LEMP - You've worked as a full-time developer for at least 3 years - You have a proven track record in building reliable IT systems - You want to participate in scrum teamwork - You have an excellent attention to detail Please only apply if you meet all these criteria. Other applications will not be considered.

We believe in change through accountability, debate, ambition and respect for the communities and individuals that make up our networked universe(s).&nbsp;</p><p>Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to control a large group of people from the top down, which is why military organizations, industrial corporations and nation-states have relied on it so heavily. But hierarchies carry their own institutional costs, which means that a regulatory bureaucracy can focus only on a few issues at a time – generally those most important to the people at the top or to the dominant groups in the ruling coalition.</p><p>But what if we can organize this company to embody the very structures of those network communication technologies and digital platforms we hope to build? What if this can enable us to take on all those dinosaur hierarchies as equals - and more than equals? What if self-regulation and social cooperation can be amplified and intensified in this way to empower all of us to care for our selves and ourselves without any authority?</p><p>That’s why Mav Farm is&nbsp;stigmergic. Like the products we build, stigmergy is a form of self-organization social network. It's the principle that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergic networks are superior to hierarchies, in that they are not slowed down by bureaucratic permission-seeking, communication asymmetries and problems associated with top-down coordination. Instead stigmergy allows individual contributors or cells to freely work within a shared platform, contributing to a shared goal as they see fit.</p><p>With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project. The innovations of individual contributors can freely travel throughout the chain when others wish to adopt them. Think of stigmergy as a heuristic approach to improving everything, allowing all of us to be agile and flexible.</p><p>This is our shorthand way of saying that we don’t have any management, and nobody “reports to” anybody else. We do have Founders, but even they aren't your manager. This company is yours to steer—toward opportunities and away from risks, toward high performance and quick creative fixes. You have the power to green-light projects. You have the power to ship products.</p><p>In this stigmergic structure every organizational barrier is removed between your work and the customer enjoying that work. Every company will tell you that “the customer is boss,” but here that statement has weight. There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what our customers want, and then giving it to them.</p><p>So far, our team has designed, architected and built things like: motion tracking in video, object recognition in video, machine learning recommender systems, real-time graphics shaders, AR shopping experiences, business intelligence dashboards, marketplace apps, video streaming apps and more. Our sights are set high! Where will you take us?</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full medical, dental and vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Retirement/401K Plan</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited PTO</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible schedules</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life &amp; Disability coverage</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

You will have the opportunity to work with leading companies and marketing teams to develop complex sites and integrations between systems.</p><p>We are a fully distributed team that primarily builds in PHP on the Magento and Drupal platforms for ecommerce and content management sites. Since we are fully remote, you can work from anywhere! We do require at least 4 hours of working time overlap with the Pacific time zone work day where most of our clients are located. As a highly client focused organization, you will occasionally need to meet according to their schedule. This typically falls between 10 and 5 Pacific time, and we strive to give you plenty of time to focus on development.</p><p>Working with a variety of clients, we fluidly form groups including a Technical Project Manager, a Quality Analyst, and one or more developers to complete sprints of work. The type of work depends on the client, but often includes:</p><ul><li>Developing custom modules and extensions for Drupal CMS and Magento Commerce.</li><li>Integration with various APIs and third-party systems.</li><li>Migrating existing sites to modern platforms.</li><li>Knowledgeable with front-end development: HTML/CSS/Javascript coding, with Twig and PHP at the template level</li></ul><p>With Bear Group, you will tackle technical problems, code and debug primarily PHP/javascript/css, and occasionally participate in client meetings. You will need to be self-motivating and able to work independently most of the time, but we have a friendly and capable team to collaborate with when you encounter obstacles. Since the technology world is constantly evolving, you’ll be expected to keep up with the current technologies and practices. To help with this, we provide an annual education stipend that can be used for attending relevant conferences or continued education courses.</p><p>During your first week you will work closely with one of our senior developers to set up your new system and familiarize with our processes and tools. The system will be either Mac, Linux, or Windows to your preference, and we use Vagrant to manage virtual machines for a consistent development server stack. Other tools you will use include:</p><ul><li>Git for source control</li><li>Bitbucket for Git repositories</li><li>Jira for project management</li><li>Confluence for documentation</li><li>Slack for communication.</li></ul><p>As you get your feet under you we will introduce some project work, again in collaboration with a senior developer on a sprint they are currently working on. Ultimately our developers work independently on your own tickets and sprints.</p><p>In addition to competitive pay, a new computer, insurance, and 401k match, you’ll also receive:</p><ul><li>3 Weeks PTO plus approximately 10 vacation days annually</li><li>$1500 annual education stipend</li><li>Software stipend for the tools that you prefer to do the job</li></ul><p><br>To learn more about the company, visit&nbsp;<a href='http://www.beargroup.com/' rel='nofollow'>www.beargroup.com</a>.

Small businesses no longer have to license expensive software to get started, or depend on a webmaster to keep their sites up to date; large businesses are made more efficient with a rock-solid CMS and e-commerce platform that don’t require the development or management of proprietary platforms.</p><p>Since Bear Group opened, we have been able to help companies grow their business in many different ways. Sometimes it’s by creating a new sales channel by opening an online store-- or driving sales by vastly improving an existing one. Sometimes it’s by developing a more professional, authoritative web presence, or building a site that’s ready for search engine marketing. Sometimes it’s by empowering a business to manage its own site so it can keep it fresh and ensure that customers have a reason to visit. And sometimes it’s in the cost savings of making a web business so much more efficient.</p><p>We work with clients ranging in size and representing many different industries. My own background is a mix of technology and business (Computer Science degree as an undergrad, followed by an MBA), and I’ve worked as a founding member of three startups as well as on 200+ marketing/technology projects for Microsoft. So I enjoy the challenges of both a new business and a larger, more established one, and I like to look at growth potential holistically.</p>            </div>        ",

It’s a full-time, 100% remote position with a flexible work/vacation schedule as lifestyle is&nbsp;<i>hugely</i>&nbsp;important to our company.</div><div><br></div><div>A curious mind, desire for autonomy while excelling in an open, truly collaborative culture of high performers makes would make you a perfect fit. These aren’t talking points. This is what we do, now.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re on pace to double this year and repeat that next year. To that end, we need more help tackling some very big engineering projects so we can handle our next leg of growth. We’re laser-focused on recruiting someone with a business mindset who loves to solve big business problems by developing beautiful, efficient code and who enjoys having immediate, visible influence on the company’s results.</div><div><br></div><div>The ideal person is extremely results-driven and gets tremendous satisfaction from having their work see the light of day quickly… and being motivated by seeing the impact it has. We want someone of who obsesses about and loves to code… but also someone who loves to solve big business problems.</div><div><br></div><div>Projects include everything from handling the massive system and data load that spending $1,000,000+ monthly on paid advertising brings, to building automated workflow tools to streamline internal operations, to developing sophisticated if/then logic in our billing code to handle the creative pricing and offers we use in our customer acquisition funnels.</div><div><br></div><div>For example, we built our own all-in-one e-commerce system in 2012 as nothing handled the complex billing and funnel logic we needed to support our sophisticated B2C marketing strategies. However, now we’re moving over to the Shopify platform and strategically integrating our existing platform. That requires a complex analysis on which system does which part the best and building a&nbsp;<i>smart</i>&nbsp;integration.</div><div><br></div><div>As another example, we build our own custom dashboards to precisely track our advertising efforts. To that end, we integrate with Google and Facebook’s APIs to ingest all the data they provide. As a result, we end up with millions of rows of data a month that needs to be efficiently organized so we can use our BI tool to extract key business insights effectively.</div><div><br></div><div>The ideal person is extremely self-motivated, loves to grind out work consistently and is comfortable being hands-on in all facets of web engineering from the browser-to-the-code-to-the-server. Experience with&nbsp;<span>marketing funnels, e-commerce systems, split testing, sales analytics, conversion rate optimization</span>&nbsp;is essential.</div><div><br></div><div>We empower our developers with a lot of autonomy and responsibility for some very meaty projects that have very large $ impacts. To that end, this opportunity is suited only for a high-performing full-stack developer with an integrative mindset and proven ability to get things done cleanly and on time.</div><div><br></div><div>You will work hand-in-hand with our CTO to optimize, support and manage our entire web infrastructure. You and our two other senior devs form our core development team of 4, covering for each other as vacation and other needs arise, while working synergistically on separate projects.</div><div><br></div><div>Just as we obsess about creating metabolism-optimizing products that get the most results in the least time, we’re looking for someone equally obsessed about doing the same thing with efficient code.</div><div><br></div><div>While your coding skills are important, it's how fast you process information, how quickly (and accurately) you can cycle through work and how well you work with the rest of our team that's crucial. To that end,&nbsp;<span>communication</span>&nbsp;is key to this role, as is the ability to self-motivate and quickly turn a business conversation into an actionable set of dev tasks that you can jump on immediately.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Who is This Opportunity Perfect for?</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Anybody who truly is a top coder and creative architect who might relate to any of these:</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re tired of the commute, sick of burning the midnight oil, stress is dominating your life, and the cost of real estate is eating up your retirement, this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction.</div><div><br></div><div>Or, if you’ve always wanted to be a part of the thrill of a rapidly growing company, but didn’t want to move to an expensive big city with all the madness, stress and high cost that brings, this is your opportunity to stay where you are (or move to where you always wanted to go) to design your ideal life.</div><div><br></div><div>Or, if you’re drowning in the corporate world, suffocating from constantly shifting priorities that nobody agrees on, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get&nbsp;<i>work</i>&nbsp;done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep – to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity… and scale it like never before.</div><div><br></div><div>Regardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day… AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we can’t wait to meet you.</div><div><br></div><div><span></span></div><div><b>What are the Requirements?</b></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Deep experience as an&nbsp;<span>end-to-end web application developer/web architect</span>&nbsp;responsible for every single part of the project including requirements gathering, project management, system architecture, infrastructure setup, coding, integrating with 3rd parties, documenting and testing.</li><li>Heavy&nbsp;<span>marketing-systems</span>&nbsp;focus with&nbsp;<span>deep experience in e-commerce</span>, payment processing, split testing, funnel development, analytics, page speed optimization, API integrations, etc.</li><li><span>10+ years’ experience</span>&nbsp;as a software engineer/web developer with recent, applicable focus on database-driven web applications on a&nbsp;<span>LAMP stack</span>.</li><li>Expert-level, working knowledge of&nbsp;<span>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</span>; our design team creates most of the assets, but you’ll be implementing, optimizing, troubleshooting, and adding functionality.</li><li>Ability to build&nbsp;<span>complex PHP applications</span>&nbsp;quickly, efficiently, and&nbsp;<span>under pressure</span>.

    "content": "*About Us*<br />*Work In Startups* is the UK's number 1 platform for startup jobs. A site built by the startup community, for the startup community, we’ve grown from a humble launch in 2011 to becoming the largest dedicated tech startup job site in the country. Recently acquired by *Adzuna* (more about Adzuna below), we have some very exciting growth plans for 2019 and beyond, and are looking to bring on an experienced, contract, full-stack PHP developer for a minimum of 3 months to join our world class tech team and help millions of people find their dream startup job.<br /><br />*The Role*<br />Our engineering team is pivotal to Work In Startups’ (and Adzuna’s!) future. It’s an exciting time as we scale our existing product offering and also innovate with new tools and user experiences to get more people into better start up jobs. We’re also only a small unit within Adzuna’s 30-strong developer team (a startup within a startup if you will!), so there’s a genuine opportunity to make a real difference here. <br /><br />Based in our great Fulham office (or remotely based in Europe), you will work alongside our current lead developers and GM (as well as our Adzuna bank of back end, front end, dev/ops and product specialists), overseeing all aspects of our stack. The projects you will work on will include an initial revamp and reskin of the existing site before implementing a number of new features to enhance the user experience on Work In Startups for both jobseekers and employers. There will also be an opportunity to review our existing codebase and implement functional improvements to sharpen our edges, so we’re looking for someone keen to get truly stuck into the weeds. The aim is to build our systems and codebase to scale, and you will be able to demonstrate your experience in writing scalable code running in distributed environments.<br /><br />Note, this is for a 3 month contract role but with the opportunity to extend further if mutually of interest!<br /><br />*About you*<br />We don’t like to put people in boxes, but you’re likely to have or be able to demonstrate much of the below:<br />* Experience in partnering with other developers to improve existing systems and develop new functionality and tools<br />* Able to analyse business and technical requirements and develop solutions, taking into account variable aspects, such as performance, scalability, ease of maintenance and cost<br />* Proven ability to help refactor existing processes and workflows to improve efficiency <br />* Passion for and ambition to assist and mentor other members of our development team<br /><br />*Technical competency and tools*<br />* 5+ years with high-volume/high-traffic applications/sites<br />* 5+ years of professional experience with PHP (across the full stack), with expert level of the Zend framework<br />* Proficient in MySQL<br />* Excellent knowledge of / experience with Javascript, HTML, CSS, Bash, Behat, Node.js<br />* Fluent English<br />* Strong attention to detail<br /><br />*Useful extra skills / experience*<br />* Classified ads / vertical search websites<br />* Experience with nginx and MongoDB<br />* Search technology and search engine optimisation<br />* Solr, Lucene, ElasticSearch or other search engine<br />* Experience working with remote teams<br />* Fluent Greek a bonus (but not essential)!<br /><br />*About Adzuna (the parent company of Work In Startups!)*<br />Adzuna is a search engine for job ads used by over 10 million visitors per month that aims to list every job, everywhere. We search thousands of websites so our users don't have to, bringing together millions of ads in one place.
