    "content": "<h1><strong>About us</strong></h1><br /><p>We are on a journey to make pet healthcare more accessible, and we want you to help us! Did you know that only 8% of health issues are seen by a veterinary professional? In real numbers: pets experience 24 issues per year, but only 2 of them make it to the vet. This isn&rsquo;t because people are bad at being pet owners &mdash; going to the vet can be expensive, and takes a lot of effort, and sometimes it&rsquo;s even embarrassing. We want to remove all these barriers that stop pet parents from seeking expert care so that our pets can live the long and healthy lives they deserve.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our mission is to empower vets to advocate for their patients wherever and whenever suits them. Our current product provides an app-based approach that allows vets to interact with their patients through a combination of chat and video consultations. The future holds lots of exciting opportunities to expand this into the go-to app for all things pet care related. Gula recently raised a pre-seed round of funding, and off the back of that, we are looking to build the beginnings of our product team, which is where you come in. With a goal like allowing pets to live healthier lives, a fantastic experience across all our user facing products is going to be key to overcoming challenges in changing the way pet owners think about how they interact with their care providers.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our customer facing products right now are in the form of iOS &amp; Android apps written in React Native, with a web-app soon to follow. We envisage most pet owners interacting with their vets through digital means via their mobile devices. To date, most UX work has been done in Sketch, but we are open to any tooling that can do the job well!</p><br /><h1><strong>Who we&rsquo;re looking for</strong></h1><br /><p>You would be the first Product Designer working at Gula, which gives you the opportunity to help architect the ways of working in the product team and put in place what we would consider to be best practices.

Your role will be to build and maintain great relationships with a network of work spaces.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re therefore looking for an energetic people-person to help us build a strong network of workspaces that our customers can access through the Desana app.</p><br /><h2>People</h2><br /><p>Desana gives people access to a network of great work space when they want it, where they want it, through a single monthly subscription.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a growing startup based between London, Edinburgh, and Stockholm. We aim to become a globally relevant company by disrupting the way people think about, and access, the places they work. We're looking for the best people to join us on our journey.</p><br /><p>With prior experience in startups ourselves, we&rsquo;re keen to do things the right way from the very start. That&rsquo;s why we believe in openness and transparency in everything we do, from salary to communications, to processes.</p><br /><h2>Why Join Us</h2><br /><p>We&rsquo;re at the forefront of a new wave of innovation in the office space sector which is already undergoing tremendous change and significant growth. Join us to not only grow the network of workspaces that are already changing the ways people work, but by living and breathing that transformation as you work flexibly, autonomously, and (as much as the job demands) remotely yourself. We pride ourselves in radical open-ness and strive to create a company that fulfils its users, partners, and employees.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2>The Role</h2><br /><h2><em>Growing the Network</em></h2><br /><p>We want to build a network that&rsquo;s genuinely valuable to our customers and the operators that we work with. To do that, we need someone that&rsquo;s motivated to: &nbsp;</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Increase the number of workspaces on the Desana platform each month across the UK.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Collaborate in the shaping and delivery of a scalable space onboarding and retention&nbsp; strategies - regular communication with workspaces on the network; in person, LinkedIn, by phone, by email, and through events.</li><br /><li>Maintain CRM to track relationships and opportunities.</li><br /><li>Create and deliver result orientated &ldquo;sprints&rdquo; (tasks) based on the company&rsquo;s 6 and 12 month goals.&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><h2><em>Communication</em></h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Working directly with team to incessantly improve brand and workspace onboarding experience / interaction.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Regular monitoring and updating of our task management system.</li><br /><li>Prepare weekly, monthly, quarterly meetings that effectively communicate data informed outcomes from onboarding strategies.</li><br /><li>Participate daily in a 10 minute whole team &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; call, wherever you are.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2><em>Industry Awareness</em></h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Consistently develop wider awareness of coworking industry trends; meticulous attention to specific triggers for workspace / operator types.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Be able to identify and respond to micro-indicators of change.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2><em>About You</em></h2><br /><ul><br /><li>You have hospitality or related experience: If you&rsquo;ve worked in the coworking / flexible workspace industry or in a workspace brokering environment that would be advantageous (2-3 years preferably, but not critical to apply).&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have experience in sales: it would be great if you can bring experience in managing operational tasks in a sales/relationship management role.</li><br /><li>You can stay cool and deliver effectively: you have the ability to work to a deadline, prioritising workloads according to different criteria.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re data-driven: you understand growth metrics, A/B testing, and statistics and will use these skills to devise effective on-boarding strategies.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have CRM experience / awareness: particularly Hubspot. Not essential but would be really useful.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re personable: a fun, enthusiastic people-person. Ready to jump on the phone for a chat when appropriate.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re self-starting &amp; self-motivated: you&rsquo;re confident in your abilities, willing to take initiative, to take on your own responsibilities, and manage your own agendas and work scopes. Actively seek and respond to feedback.</li><br /><li>You can communicate diligently: you&rsquo;re able to understand the importance of maintaining regular communication with our team, our partners, and the workspace operators in our network. Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re never complacent: you strive to recognise that things can always be better than they currently are and have the confidence to present solutions to any weaknesses or inefficiencies that you see.</li><br /><li>You have a growth mindset: a desire to grow both personally and professionally.</li><br /><li>You have grit: the resilience and desire to work in a startup. You know when to seize the right opportunities in a fast-paced environment, while working to exceed the expectations of all market segments.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have a good network: if you have a good contact base in the UK coworking / property sector, that would be extremely useful but not essential.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Desana Benefits</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Share options in the business.</li><br /><li>Flexible and remote work hours with a strong focus on work-life balance.</li><br /><li>We&rsquo;re establishing complete salary transparency across the company with clear progression paths.</li><br /><li>Team drinks, events, and trips.</li><br /><li>Free access to the app and our network of workspaces.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Think you&rsquo;re the right person for the role?

The strongest candidates will possess the qualities and mindsets below:</p><ul><li><strong>You love details. </strong>You notice things that other people don’t. You approach each task you lead with an eagle eye toward details and anticipate every step and possible misstep in the process. It makes you incredibly happy when things fit together just right and projects and plans have been laid out down to the last detail. Secretly, there’s something you love about vetting a data set or proofreading a final document – you love catching and righting those small, but in your mind, critical points.</li><li><strong>You make things happen.</strong> You don’t get overwhelmed easily and you take personal responsibility for the success of your work whether it requires managing back-end processes, engaging with a team, or setting up others to execute effectively. You take pride in your integrity and follow-through on tasks. People would describe you as <em>dependable</em> and <em>driven</em>; they know when they ask you to do something, it’s as good as done.</li><li><strong>You’re a self-driven learner. </strong>You consistently seek feedback from diverse sources to learn and improve; you drive your professional development with purpose and focus on outcomes; and you have a knack for devising, implementing, and investing others in systems that improve individual and team performance. Reflecting on your work and strengthening your approach based on your reflections is second nature to you.</li><li><strong>You’re a great communicator.</strong> You value precision and clarity in language. Whatever the medium, when people receive a message from you they are crystal-clear on the purpose and any requested action. They feel respected and that their time was well-spent.</li><li><strong>You know policies like the back of your hand.</strong> You understand the importance of policies and procedures, and you take time to fully internalize them. You care about being a steward of our organization’s resources and you work to ensure that we stretch the Teach For America dollar as efficiently as possible, taking advantage of all discounts and corporate partnerships. You care about the way we spend our money and adhere to policies because you understand the stakes involved when we spend money that’s been fundraised by our colleagues.</li><li><strong>You’re a logistics master. </strong>You have superior logistics skills. You think ahead about what will be needed and strategize or make adjustments accordingly. Whether it be housing, dining, transportation or an unknown variable, you have lined up the necessary supports and resources well in advance and everyone involved in something you’re planning knows where to be, by when, and what the back-up plan is, just in case.</li><li><strong>You’re a jack of all trades. </strong>You’re flexible. You know a little bit about a lot of things and if you don’t know, you’re quick to learn. You’re willing to help out wherever needed and thrive in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment. You are a resourceful, results-oriented team player with a positive “can do” attitude and a sense of humor. You are skilled at managing complexity and adjust course easily and quickly when things fall off-track. You’re not thrown off by feedback (in fact, you thrive on it) and are able to incorporate and turn it around quickly.</li><li><strong>You’re a people person. </strong>You forge strong, trusting relationships with diverse groups of people. You’re empathetic and intuitive; you often know what people need or want before they do. You’re socially flexible and know how to attune and calibrate your interactional style depending on the environment, audience, or context. You are fueled by collaborating and working to make others efficient and effective. You know when a healthy dose of humor is called for. People really like you, and you really like them.</li></ul><p><strong>THE ORGANIZATION</strong><br>There are more than 16 million children growing up in poverty in the U.S., and less than 10 percent of them will graduate from college. These statistics are not a reflection of our children’s potential; we know that children growing up in poverty can and do achieve at the highest levels. Rather, these statistics reflect the systemic lack of access and opportunity for children in low-income communities.</p><p>Teach For America’s (TFA) mission is to find, develop, and support a diverse network of leaders committed to expanding opportunity for children from classrooms, schools, and every sector and field that shapes the broader systems in which schools operate. We are seeking individuals who align with our mission, core values and commitment to Diversity Equity &amp; Inclusiveness and are ready to join us in this global movement.</p><p><strong>THE PERSON</strong><br>The Associate, Executive Leadership and Learning will be responsible for:</p><ul><li><strong>ELL Team Operational Support (40%)</strong><ul><li>Manage logistics and execution for all team culture hallmarks such as birthdays, years of service, personal milestones (i.e. weddings, babies, etc.), transitions, and general team culture strategies.</li><li>Draft, edit, and get approval on the monthly team blast communication. This may include making recommendations on how to creatively increase effectiveness of these communications.</li><li>Prepare content and materials for monthly team calls in partnership with the SMD, Chief of Staff. This includes updating the scope &amp; sequence for call topics and prepping speakers and presenters.</li><li>Manage all call operations for monthly team calls. This includes saving the recording, running the zoom video-conferencing platform, sharing any presentation materials on the screen, and logging the chat.</li><li>Drive the logistics and execution of team retreats (1-2x/year). This includes finding a location, negotiating contracts, drafting communications, meal planning, budgeting, and all other operational support.</li><li>Serve as a back-up support for the SVP, ELL as needed when her executive assistant is unavailable.</li><li>Manage the Elevate year-long performance review process for all ELL team members including communications, deadline tracking, and summarizing survey results in coordination with the HA team.</li><li>One-off projects and needs</li></ul></li><li><strong>Direct support for the Advisory sub-team (two SVPs, Advisory and one Chief of Staff) (30%)</strong><ul><li>Set calendar strategy for the two SVPs, Advisory in partnership with their Chief of Staff, working to ensure their priorities are reflected in their meticulously maintained calendars and time is maximized.</li><li>Book all travel in accordance with organizational per diems while also maximizing SVPs’ time.</li><li>Coordinate with regions to plan site visit agendas, logistics and prep materials for SVPs.</li><li>Assisting SVPs with document creation and editing as needed.</li><li>Synthesizing materials and information in relation to SVPs’ regional support.</li><li>Process expense reports for the SVPs and their Chief of Staff in accordance with finance policies.</li><li>Manage the Advisory team budget and ensure accurate forecasting for spending throughout the year.</li></ul></li><li><strong>ELL Team Budget &amp; Finance Compliance (20%)</strong><ul><li>Manage and track team budget overall, ensuring we are under-spending for the fiscal year and that all spending and finance processing is compliant with org-wide policies.</li><li>Keep track of compliance across teams monthly by reviewing reports and checking in with the Office of the Chief Operating and Program Officer.</li><li>Manage team supply ordering via the Amazon Business account.</li><li>Manage the ELL Team Card and serve as a buyer liaison to help manage large purchasing and contracts across sub-teams.

    "content": "<h3> Humbly Confident Product Designer </h3><div><div>YNAB is growing, and so is our product design team. We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal finance apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have experience in designing great interfaces and experiences for most of those platforms. More important, you’re a designer who views your job as that of problem solver. You come to the table not only with a knack for interaction design and love of logical UI patterns, but also with a deep empathy for people. We design our software to fit our users more than our fancy, and you love nothing more than digging through (or conducting!) research that leads the way in the design process. You’ve been around the block a few times and know what it means to design a mature, evolving product.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):&nbsp;</strong></div><ul><li>You must have at least 3 years of experience working in product design <strong>at a software company.</strong> Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.</li><li>Experience in designing applications for both web and mobile (in your cover letter, please include the platforms for which you have designed and your level of experience with them).&nbsp;</li><li>We are looking for a designer who has a strong background in UX and usability but who also can design UI independently. This is a truly mixed position where you will be responsible for activities traditionally held in the “UX” and “UI” wheelhouses. And a user-testing/research wheelhouse, too. (Can you have three wheelhouses? Are they still wheelhouses? Yes, sometimes we do philosophical tangents, too.)</li></ul><div>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></h3><div>We build YNAB (or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands), the best budgeting software around. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.<br><br><br></div><div>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> Cultural Manifesto</a> has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong><br>Who you’d be working with:<br></strong><br><br></div><div><strong>Todd, </strong>our Chief Product Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—and knows that begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence <strong>and </strong>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.<br><br><br></div><div>And our product designers:<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Alan</strong> can be seen wearing many hats—and loving every second of it. He could be interviewing users one day and programming a prototype in Framer the next. He loves exploring ideas with teammates and lives for that rush when the team discovers a novel solution to a difficult problem. When he’s not busy designing, he’s probably either at Crossfit or working to improve his culinary skills... or contemplating the conflicts that occasionally arise between the two.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Andrea </strong>has spent a lengthy career knee-deep in interactive design. Today she finds great satisfaction in her dream job at YNAB where design and helping others converge—the perfect environment for empathic-driven design. After work, this compulsive doodler cherishes her time with her husband and kids. Soaking up live music, art, and setting sail on the occasional cruise are among her favorite to-dos.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Cindy </strong>sweats the small details when it comes to crafting simple, intuitive experiences. She loves having conversations with our users, and digs deep to find the root of their needs before exploring a solution. On most weekends (and some weekdays, depending on the daylight saving time), you can probably find her outdoors chasing sunrise and sunset with a camera in hand.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Dylan </strong>loves organizing design systems, obsessing over typographic details, and everything in between. Above his desk (ahem, kitchen table, it's a small apartment after all) sits an inconspicuous letterpressed card with Dieter Rams' 10 principles of good design on it. In his spare time he's probably taking photos or running—sometimes at the same time.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Emily</strong> is a design generalist, through and through. What she loves most about being a designer—besides the obvious draw of working with a team to build things people love—is how much there is to learn. Right now she's focused on honing her coding skills enough to be able to put up the occasional pull request as well as practicing the art of writing great microcopy. She enjoys reading books, cooking, biking, lifting weights, and spending time outdoors.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Kathryn</strong> loves to dig into problems and learn where things aren’t working, what people need, and how we can empower them to be even more amazing.&nbsp; And once she truly understands a problem, figuring out how to solve it is pretty fun. When she’s not at work, she can usually be found reading, conquering escape rooms, or hanging out with her family.<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></h3><div>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. In fact, we were recently recognized as <a href='https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune's #2 best small company to work for</a> in the United States! We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</div><div><strong><br>Live Where You Want<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too.&nbsp; Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</div><div><strong><br>No Crazy Hours<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</div><div><strong><br>Take Vacation (Seriously)<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our Slack channel, creatively named #office_wall</div><div><strong><br>The YNAB Meetup<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'> Costa Rica</a>, a <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and we most recently took over an entire hotel in Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</div><div><strong><br>Up Your Game<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>International is Absolutely Okay<br></strong><br><br></div><div>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</div><div><strong><br>If You’re Stateside…<br></strong><br><br></div><div>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)<br><br><br></div><div>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em><em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)<br><br><br></div><div><strong><br>Other Tidbits</strong></div><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp;</li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not <em>think</em> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.<br><br><br></div><h3>Now, back to you, our new Product Designer...</h3><div><strong>What Success Looks Like: <br></strong><br><br></div><div>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life changing financial control. No small thing, right? You’ll join our six product designers, working on both our web and mobile platforms. Throughout 2020, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB <em>effortless </em>and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience. You will also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users.<br><br><br></div><div>You’ll need to:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Understand the journey our users take, not just as they use our apps, but in the real world as they seek to take control of their financial lives.</li><li>Learn the design system, UI patterns, and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You have no problem designing a cross-platform feature for the web and mobile apps. You can clearly discern and navigate the relationship between the UI and the available data behind the scenes.&nbsp;</li><li>Solve design problems in a user-centric feedback loop. Research plays a big part in our design process so you’ll need to break down analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions. You’ll also follow up on the data gathered after the feature is released and continue to iterate and improve your designs until the data confirms success.&nbsp;</li><li>Shepherd your work from ideation to release. You will document your work for review with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders, make agreed-upon refinements, and will work with the developers on the upcoming feature. Design reviews during the development process examine form and function and you will see the feature through to the end.&nbsp;</li><li>Be comfortable iterating with low-fidelity designs and prototypes while working in cross-functional teams made up of developers, marketers, and customer-facing team members (waterfalls are for rivers!), while continuing to pursue a meticulous and thorough design.</li><li>Communicate and document the styling, user flows, and the impact of your designs on other parts of the system. You’ll update this documentation as feedback comes in and the apps evolve. On the flip side, you’ll provide feedback in design reviews that is clear and helpful in moving our products forward.</li><li>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done <em>in writing. </em>Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</li><li>Be comfortable writing a first pass at UI copy which is then refined with the help of your team in design reviews. There’s no lorem ipsum here.&nbsp;</li><li>You are comfortable speaking the language of software development. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!) to help implement your design work, that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement.</li><li>We use Figma for the vast majority of design work and maintaining our design system. You will aid in the expansion and maintenance of the design system and feel comfortable contributing new UI for our applications and website. If you have experience developing and maintaining design systems and can help us strike a balance between fighting for consistency and pushing the design system forward, that’s another plus.</li><li>Be comfortable talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing. You have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way to share with teammates.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem solving for both user and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our product: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…<br><br><br></div><div>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</div><h3><strong>How to Apply</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Apply below by 11:59PM on Oct 3rd, 2019.</strong> Firm. It’s a real deadline. Like, <em>after</em> it is too late.</li><li>Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:<ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.&nbsp;</li><li>We love a designer with a perspective. What’s yours? Feel free to touch on your beliefs on how design should be done, what it’s used for, or why it’s important.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Please include a portfolio that contains the following:&nbsp;<ul><li>Design work across web and mobile&nbsp;</li><li>Your design process (wireframes, interviews, architecture documentation)</li><li>Links to any live work.&nbsp;</li><li>Please state the role you played on each project.</li></ul></li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for.</li></ul><div>P.S.&nbsp; If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who might be, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!<br><br><br></div></div>",

We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal finance apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have experience in designing great interfaces and experiences for most of those platforms. More important, you’re a designer who views your job as that of problem solver. You come to the table not only with a knack for interaction design and love of logical UI patterns, but also with a deep empathy for people. We design our software to fit our users more than our fancy, and you love nothing more than digging through (or conducting!) research that leads the way in the design process. You’ve been around the block a few times and know what it means to design a mature, evolving product.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>You must have at least 3 years of experience working in product design&nbsp;</span><span>at a software company.</span><span>&nbsp;Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.</span></li><li><span>Experience in designing applications for both web and mobile (in your cover letter, please include the platforms for which you have designed and your level of experience with them).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>We are looking for a designer who has a strong background in UX and usability but who also can design UI independently. This is a truly mixed position where you will be responsible for activities traditionally held in the “UX” and “UI” wheelhouses. And a user-testing/research wheelhouse, too. (Can you have three wheelhouses? Are they still wheelhouses? Yes, sometimes we do philosophical tangents, too.)</span></li></ul><p><span>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>A Bit About Us</span></h3><p><span>We build YNAB (or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands), the best budgeting software around. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a><span>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></p><p><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;<span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span>&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;</span><em>click</em><span>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Who you’d be working with:</span></h4><p><span>Todd,&nbsp;</span><span>our Chief Product Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—and knows that begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</span></p><p><span>And our product designers:</span></p><p><span>Alan</span><span>&nbsp;can be seen wearing many hats—and loving every second of it. He could be interviewing users one day and programming a prototype in Framer the next. He loves exploring ideas with teammates and lives for that rush when the team discovers a novel solution to a difficult problem. When he’s not busy designing, he’s probably either at Crossfit or working to improve his culinary skills… or contemplating the conflicts that occasionally arise between the two.</span></p><p><span>Andrea&nbsp;</span><span>has spent a lengthy career knee-deep in interactive design. Today she finds great satisfaction in her dream job at YNAB where design and helping others converge—the perfect environment for empathic-driven design. After work, this compulsive doodler cherishes her time with her husband and kids. Soaking up live music, art, and setting sail on the occasional cruise are among her favorite to-dos.</span></p><p><span>Cindy&nbsp;</span><span>sweats the small details when it comes to crafting simple, intuitive experiences. She loves having conversations with our users, and digs deep to find the root of their needs before exploring a solution. On most weekends (and some weekdays, depending on the daylight saving time), you can probably find her outdoors chasing sunrise and sunset with a camera in hand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Dylan&nbsp;</span><span>l</span><span>oves organizing design systems, obsessing over typographic details, and everything in between. Above his desk (ahem, kitchen table, it’s a small apartment after all) sits an inconspicuous letterpressed card with Dieter Rams’ 10 principles of good design on it. In his spare time he’s probably taking photos or running—sometimes at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Emily</span><span>&nbsp;is a design generalist, through and through. What she loves most about being a designer—besides the obvious draw of working with a team to build things people love—is how much there is to learn. Right now she’s focused on honing her coding skills enough to be able to put up the occasional pull request as well as practicing the art of writing great microcopy. She enjoys reading books, cooking, biking, lifting weights, and spending time outdoors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kathryn</span><span>&nbsp;loves to dig into problems and learn where things aren’t working, what people need, and how we can empower them to be even more amazing.&nbsp; And once she truly understands a problem, figuring out how to solve it is pretty fun. When she’s not at work, she can usually be found reading, conquering escape rooms, or hanging out with her family.</span></p><h3><span>How You’ll Work at YNAB</span></h3><p><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. In fact, we were recently recognized as</span>&nbsp;<a href='https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune’s #2 best small company to work for</a><span>&nbsp;in the United States!</span>&nbsp;<span>We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></p><h5><span>Live Where You Want</span></h5><p><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too.&nbsp; Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></p><h5><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h5><p><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></p><h5><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h5><p><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;</span><em>minimum</em><span>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our Slack channel, creatively named #office_wall.</span></p><h5><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></h5><p><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;Costa Rica</a><span>, a&nbsp;</span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a><span>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and we most recently took over an entire hotel in Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></p><h5><span>Up Your Game</span></h5><p><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h5><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></h5><p><span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</span></p><h5><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h5><p><span>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;</span><em>and your family.</em><span>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</span></p><p><span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;</span><em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)</span></p><h5><span>Other Tidbits</span></h5><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas.</span></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;</span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not&nbsp;</span><em>think</em><span>&nbsp;that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span></li></ul><p><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</span></p><h3><span>Now, back to you, our new Product Designer…</span></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>What Success Looks Like:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life changing financial control. No small thing, right? You’ll join our six product designers, working on both our web and mobile platforms. Throughout 2020, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB&nbsp;</span><em>effortless&nbsp;</em><span>and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience. You will also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users.</span></p><p><span>You’ll need to:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>Understand the journey our users take, not just as they use our apps, but in the real world as they seek to take control of their financial lives.</span></li><li><span>Learn the design system, UI patterns, and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You have no problem designing a cross-platform feature for the web and mobile apps. You can clearly discern and navigate the relationship between the UI and the available data behind the scenes.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Solve design problems in a user-centric feedback loop. Research plays a big part in our design process so you’ll need to break down analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions. You’ll also follow up on the data gathered after the feature is released and continue to iterate and improve your designs until the data confirms success.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Shepherd your work from ideation to release. You will document your work for review with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders, make agreed-upon refinements, and will work with the developers on the upcoming feature. Design reviews during the development process examine form and function and you will see the feature through to the end.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable iterating with low-fidelity designs and prototypes while working in cross-functional teams made up of developers, marketers, and customer-facing team members (waterfalls are for rivers!), while continuing to pursue a meticulous and thorough design.</span></li><li><span>Communicate and document the styling, user flows, and the impact of your designs on other parts of the system. You’ll update this documentation as feedback comes in and the apps evolve. On the flip side, you’ll provide feedback in design reviews that is clear and helpful in moving our products forward.</span></li><li><span>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done&nbsp;</span><em>in writing.&nbsp;</em><span>Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable writing a first pass at UI copy which is then refined with the help of your team in design reviews. There’s no lorem ipsum here.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>You are comfortable speaking the language of software development. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!) to help implement your design work, that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement.</span></li><li><span>We use Figma for the vast majority of design work and maintaining our design system. You will aid in the expansion and maintenance of the design system and feel comfortable contributing new UI for our applications and website. If you have experience developing and maintaining design systems and can help us strike a balance between fighting for consistency and pushing the design system forward, that’s another plus.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing. You have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way to share with teammates.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem solving for both user and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our product: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</span></p><p><span>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</span></p><h3><span>How to Apply</span></h3><ul><li><span>Apply through the link below (or here:&nbsp;<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk03p1u' rel='nofollow'>https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk03p1u)</a>&nbsp;by 11:59PM on Oct 3rd, 2019</span><span>.</span>&nbsp;<span>Firm. It’s a real deadline. Like,&nbsp;</span><em>after</em><span>&nbsp;it is too late.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</span></li><ul><li><span>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>We love a designer with a perspective. What’s yours? Feel free to touch on your beliefs on how design should be done, what it’s used for, or why it’s important.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><li><span>Please include a portfolio that contains the following:&nbsp;</span></li><ul><li><span>Design work across web and mobile&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Your design process (wireframes, interviews, architecture documentation)</span></li><li><span>Links to any live work.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Please state the role you played on each project.</span></li></ul><li><span>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who might be, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!</span></p><p></p>  </div>",

We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;6m in venture funding from the most respected investors in technology and real estate. Our vision is to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed. The beginning of this journey is our online platform to help businesses rent, manage and share office space in London.</p><br /><p>As a product designer at Hubble, you will have the opportunity to add your magic to every stage of the design process. Working closely with product managers and tech leads, you will have the autonomy to conjure up functional yet delightful solutions to genuine user problems. All the while working towards business goals.</p><br /><p>Your role will of course include wire-framing, prototyping and spinning up high fidelity designs and assets but this is only a small part. Through user testing and internal feedback sessions, you will be responsible for continually testing ideas and assumptions and mixing your findings back into the designs. You will be able to use these findings to explain and defend your design rationale with the wider team and stakeholders. Excellent communication skills, explaining complex solutions in simple terms and the ability to challenge people in the wider team at all levels, backed with evidence, are all crucial.</p><br /><p>Strong visual UI design is a given, but beyond that you will be instrumental in following and helping to build out the Hubble design system. You will work closely with our engineers and regularly pair with them to help set the rules and ingredients for new design assets and components. A keen eye for detail is important but you should understand the trade-offs between striving for pixel-perfection against good enough to ship fast.</p><br /><p>You will possess a functional but creative mind and a no-fear attitude to your work. With a scientific approach to product design, don't be afraid to fail-fast and learn. You will feel empowered to push the needle, and suggest wildcard ideas that may make some colleagues squirm, but always be grounded in the possible. We build our products in an iterative, continuous deployment style, but as a designer you should always be thinking of where we want to be rather than just what's next.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>REQUIREMENTS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years experience in designing digital products.</li><br /><li>Fully proficient in designing for various screen sizes with a mobile first approach to responsive design.</li><br /><li>Solid understanding of UX design principles.</li><br /><li>Good understanding of atomic design and front end architecture.</li><br /><li>Expertise in the tools of the trade, sketch, invision etc. UI animations desirable but not required.</li><br /><li>Have the confidence to explain and defend design decisions to colleagues at all levels.</li><br /><li>Experience in mapping out user journeys and flows.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>&nbsp;</h2><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>BENEFITS</h2><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture.

    "content": "<div>The RoleRun organic and paid search for the Moment Shop, the largest online store for photography, filmmaking, and travel. The role is bigger than Moment the gear maker. It extends to the gear, apps, and photography trips we sell in the Moment Shop. This means supporting 20 different brands and making our store the place you shop before your next trip. On one side you'll be following the traditional role for search in making sure every article, trip, and product page is authoritative. This means managing both our organic and paid efforts to rank for the searches that matter. This also extends to multiple search boxes with Google, Amazon, Youtube, and iTunes to name a few. If people are searching for photography, filmmaking, and travel we want to win these searches. On the other side you get to work creatively with our content and commerce teams as they explore what content to publish and what products to sell. You will be collaborating with them from the beginning, using data to help them make better decisions.

You will have full autonomy of a cross-functional squad and will concoct a viable roadmap that mixes customer requirements (often poorly stated or not clearly known by customers themselves) with our vision, sales team feedback, product data and engineering team capabilities in order to build impactful products.</p><br /><p>Though your roadmap is never set in stone. You need to be comfortable in an experimental environment of flux and speed. You adapt to fluid circumstances as new information is learned and priorities change. And in this state of flux you are key to figuring out what not to build, bringing focus and steadiness to teams.</p><br /><p>To do all this, we believe that a great Product Manager is a clarifier, not a confuser. You need to be able to take complexity and distil out what really matters. You are clear-headed and comfortable making decisions on how to do less, not more. To you, less means cutting scope and not quality; constantly trying to find creative (and sometimes risky) solutions to seemingly unfathomable problems. Particularly in situations where data is lacking you must rely on qualitative user research in order to make this call, always with the end goal in mind.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, host monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years product related experience within a tech startup environment.</li><br /><li>Be comfortable managing stakeholders and distilling differing voices within a company.</li><br /><li>Have built a product roadmap that balances customer problems with business goals.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>Proficient with data; understanding what to measure and how.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture.

We are building Wethos Teams, a platform that enables independent specialists to join or form temporary micro-agencies to tackle larger, more complex initiatives.

We’re growing our business every month, we’re well-funded, and we’re investing heavily in our platform.</p><p><strong>Job description:</strong></p><p>We’re looking for a Lead Product Designer for the new Wethos Teams platform. Our goal is to provide an integrated set of scoping, networking, project delivery, and payment services that make it incredibly easy for remote, independent specialists to collaborate on teams together. The platform spans functional areas such as professional networking, client relationship management, project scoping and management, and billing. We believe that by removing barriers for clients (finding qualified teams) and freelancers (doing work with their existing networks and finding others to work with), we can unlock a tidal wave of opportunities that are normally reserved for full-service agencies.</p><p>For that to happen, our platform has to coordinate workflows across many parties, and do it in a way that is consistent, simple and rewarding. Projects can be chaotic and stressful – communication and visibility are critical. As our lead Product Designer, you will be building experiences that help people come together and collaborate, cut through the chaos, and provide transparency.

The incredibly competitive nature of the sports betting industry gave birth to a plethora of betting promotions to entice new and existing customers. These promotions allowed savvy gamblers to take advantage of markets using a risk-free match betting strategy. This business founded to educate this risk-free strategy to the less savvy betting customer as well as people that may have never placed a bet before by creating exceptional video content with clear and precise instructions. They began gaining lots of traction and built their subscriber base organically to highly profitable levels.</p> <p>The bedrock of their business is their own suite of software that identifies betting opportunities for their subscribers. The core of the software is their odds system, which downloads data for hundreds of bookmakers across thousands of events (resulting in millions of rows of data) and maps that data into a central database for other systems to utilise. This data is collected by way of APIs, XML feeds and Python Screen Scraping. The odds system and related tools are .NET applications written in C#.</p> <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p> <p>The software is complex and requires someone to manage it along with a team of 4 developers (Two Python, 1 full stack and 1 C# Developer.) That's where you come in. You will undertake a full audit of all existing tech processes and will assess ways to massively optimise systems and personnel; ensuring that the end product is flawless. This will involve a mixture of hands-on analysis / coding and guiding the team to deliver. You will be responsible for ensuring all software is able to deliver on commercial goals, whilst also ensuring the development of new systems and software to stay ahead of the curve.</p> <p><em>The successful candidate should have a strong blend of the below attributes:</em></p> <ul><li>Exemplary project management and leadership skills</li><li>Familiar with AGILE or other methodologies</li><li>NET (C#)</li><li>MS SQL Server</li><li>Python</li><li>NET Core</li><li>Knowledge of REST and Web APIs</li><li>MS SQL Server (Writing SQL and stored procedures)</li><li>Github</li><li>Windows Services</li><li>Database Expertise</li><li>Some interest or experience in the sports / betting industry would be preferred.</li></ul><p><strong>What will YOU need?</strong></p> <ul><li>Extensive experience of managing teams of developers, preferably in a sports/betting company or an online aggregator focused business.</li><li>Experience managing teams, recruiting talent, optimising software and bringing software to market.</li><li>Genuine excitement at the prospect of driving a major tech overhaul with a lack of red tape.</li></ul><p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p> <ul><li>Competitive Salary: Up to £110,000</li><li>Should you wish to have an office for the tech team or manage it fully remotely will be up to you. There would likely be a couple of team meetings per month if remote. Currently, the team reside in the midlands.</li><li>Senior decision-making tech role in a fast-growing UK business as it continues to educate and smarten consumers in the sports betting industry</li></ul><p>Please apply for a more detaileed conversation about the business.</p></div>",

We don’t care about A/B testing (<em>just yet</em>) but you do need to figure out what works and what doesn’t in Spain.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the Growth Team is distributed around the world, you should have very strong communication and organizational skills. Remote working experience is a bonus, but if you’ve never worked from home, that’s fine too. Finally, you should be fluent in Spanish and English.</div><div><br></div><div>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We are already a diverse bunch, but each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the job</strong></h3><div>We need you to help us launch Jobbatical operations in Spain and generate demand for our products and services.</div><div><br></div><div>Fundamentally, the role involves doing whatever it takes to generate demand and close customers in Spain. But not any customer. It has to be the right customer.</div><div><br></div><div>You are expected to take full ownership of revenue for Spain, and work hand-in-hand with our Tallinn HQ coming up acquisition efforts, and build, optimize and automate all operational growth processes.</div><div><br></div><div>On any given day you might:</div><ul><li>Orchestrate and execute our Account Based Marketing playbook, including <em>personalized </em>drip campaigns to our potential customers.</li><li>Respond to inbound inquiries, take sales calls (which are more like consultations, really) and send a proposal to a brand new potential client.&nbsp;</li><li>Launch a Google Ads campaign, from keyword research to copy and analysis.</li><li>Report on efforts and future plans to Tallinn HQ. Also, for the question about localizing the website to Spanish, just put that you read the entire application.</li><li>Work with the Spain Immigration Lead to write documentation on the Spanish Immigration process for content or future hires.</li><li>Analyze the performance of our Facebook Ads campaigns, and optimize for the best performing audience segments.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If all that sounds exciting, let’s keep going.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>Who you’ll be working with (and from where)</strong></h3><div>You’ll work primarily with (and report to) <strong>Gonz</strong>, our Head of Growth, to plan out growth efforts. He is based in Barcelona, but travels quite a bit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll also work with Maria, our Content Strategist, and Angie, our SDR. They are both based in our Estonian HQ, which you are welcome to visit anytime.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, you’ll be working hand-by-hand with our Immigration Lead in Spain. He is based in Madrid, and just joined our team. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As our Spanish Growth Manager, you’ll be (ideally) based in Spain but as long as you speak Spanish fluently and are familiar with business practices over there, we're good. Some travel to Spain might be required.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the pay and benefits</strong></h3><ul><li>Great compensation. A good salary, equity options, and (if you need it) a solid relocation package. Obviously.</li><li>Self-care budget. A budget for books, gym, and Uber rides for when you want to treat yourself to a night out.</li><li>Tools for the job. A computer, monitor, headphones, and other hardware you might need to work comfortably.</li><li>Time for yourself. 28 days of paid vacation, 3 mental health days a year, and generous parental leave.</li><li>Flexible Work. Work from home or in our spacious office in the coolest part of town.</li><li>Annual offsite in Tallinn. Karaoke included.</li></ul></div>",

Your role will be to build and maintain great relationships with a network of work spaces.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re therefore looking for an energetic people-person to help us build a strong network of workspaces that our customers can access through the Desana app.</p><br /><h2>People</h2><br /><p>Desana gives people access to a network of great work space when they want it, where they want it, through a single monthly subscription.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a growing startup based between London, Edinburgh, and Stockholm. We aim to become a globally relevant company by disrupting the way people think about, and access, the places they work. We're looking for the best people to join us on our journey.</p><br /><p>With prior experience in startups ourselves, we&rsquo;re keen to do things the right way from the very start. That&rsquo;s why we believe in openness and transparency in everything we do, from salary to communications, to processes.</p><br /><h2>Why Join Us?</h2><br /><p>We&rsquo;re at the forefront of the new wave of innovation in the office space sector which is already undergoing tremendous change and significant growth. Join us to not only grow the network of workspaces that are already changing the ways people work, but by living and breathing that transformation as you work flexibly, autonomously, and (as much as the job demands) remotely yourself. We pride ourselves in radical open-ness and strive to create a company that fulfils its users, partners, and employees.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2>The Role</h2><br /><h3><em>Growing the Workspace (supply) Network&nbsp;</em></h3><br /><p>We want to build a network that&rsquo;s genuinely valuable to our customers and the operators that we work with. To do that, we need someone that&rsquo;s motivated to: &nbsp;</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Increase the number of workspaces on the Desana platform each month across the UK.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Collaborate in the shaping and delivery of a scalable space onboarding and retention&nbsp; strategies - regular communication with workspaces on the network; in person, LinkedIn, by phone, by email, and through events.</li><br /><li>Maintain CRM to track relationships and opportunities.</li><br /><li>Create and deliver result orientated &ldquo;sprints&rdquo; (tasks) based on the company&rsquo;s 6 and 12 month goals.&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><h3><em>Communication</em></h3><br /><ul><br /><li>Working directly with team to incessantly improve brand and workspace onboarding experience / interaction.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Regular monitoring and updating of our task management system.</li><br /><li>Prepare weekly, monthly, quarterly meetings that effectively communicate data informed outcomes from onboarding strategies.</li><br /><li>Participate daily in a 10 minute whole team &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; call, wherever you are.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Industry Awareness&nbsp;</h3><br /><ul><br /><li>Consistently develop wider awareness of coworking industry trends; meticulous attention to specific triggers for workspace / operator types.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Be able to identify and respond to micro-indicators of change.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>About You</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>You have hospitality or related experience: If you&rsquo;ve worked in the coworking / flexible workspace industry or in a workspace brokering environment that would be advantageous (2-3 years preferably, but not critical to apply).&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have experience in sales: it would be great if you can bring experience in managing operational tasks in a sales/relationship management role.</li><br /><li>You can stay cool and deliver effectively: you have the ability to work to a deadline, prioritising workloads according to different criteria.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re data-driven: you understand growth metrics, A/B testing, and statistics and will use these skills to devise effective on-boarding strategies.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have CRM experience / awareness: particularly Hubspot. Not essential but would be really useful.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re personable: a fun, enthusiastic people-person. Ready to jump on the phone for a chat when appropriate.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re self-starting &amp; self-motivated: you&rsquo;re confident in your abilities, willing to take initiative, to take on your own responsibilities, and manage your own agendas and work scopes. Actively seek and respond to feedback.</li><br /><li>You can communicate diligently: you&rsquo;re able to understand the importance of maintaining regular communication with our team, our partners, and the workspace operators in our network. Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re never complacent: you strive to recognise that things can always be better than they currently are and have the confidence to present solutions to any weaknesses or inefficiencies that you see.</li><br /><li>You have a growth mindset: a desire to grow both personally and professionally.</li><br /><li>You have grit: the resilience and desire to work in a startup. You know when to seize the right opportunities in a fast-paced environment, while working to exceed the expectations of all market segments.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have a good network: if you have a good contact base in the UK coworking / property sector, that would be extremely useful but not essential.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Desana benefits</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Share options in the business.</li><br /><li>Flexible and remote work hours with a strong focus on work-life balance.</li><br /><li>e&rsquo;re establishing complete salary transparency across the company with clear progression paths.</li><br /><li>Team drinks, events, and trips.</li><br /><li>Free access to the app and our network of workspaces.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Think you&rsquo;re the right person for the role?

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. The Elastic family unites employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p>We’re looking to add a new Product Management node to the Elastic Product cluster.

Now we need you to take the next step.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the job</strong></h3><div>We need you to help us launch Jobbatical operations in Germany and generate demand for our products and services.</div><div><br></div><div>Fundamentally, the role involves doing whatever it takes to generate demand and close customers in Germany. But not any customer. It has to be the right customer.</div><div><br></div><div>You are expected to take full ownership of revenue for Germany, and work hand-in-hand with our Tallinn HQ coming up acquisition efforts, and build, optimize and automate all operational growth processes.</div><div><br></div><div>On any given day you might:</div><ul><li>Respond to inbound inquiries, take sales calls (which are more like consultations, really) and send a proposal to a brand new potential client.&nbsp;</li><li>Launch a Google Ads campaign, from keyword research to copy and analysis.</li><li>Send a <em>personalized </em>drip campaign to our potential customers.&nbsp;</li><li>Report on efforts and future plans to Tallinn HQ. Also, for the question about localizing the website to German, just put that you read the entire application.</li><li>Work with the German Immigration Lead to write documentation on the German Immigration process for content or future hires.</li><li>Analyze the performance of our Facebook Ads campaigns, and optimize for the best performing audience segments.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If all that sounds exciting, let’s keep going.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About you</strong></h3><div>You must have a strong entrepreneurial spirit, and you should’ve spent the last couple of years driving growth and sales at a small team, wearing multiple hats.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You could be an ex-startup founder, part of a startup’s founding team, or part of a Launch Team in a big company (think Rocket Internet, Uber, Deliveroo, Bolt, etc.)</div><div><br></div><div>You need to work independently, and be able to hit goals. Your <em>only</em> responsibility will be to work alongside our German Immigration Lead and drive new customers in our German operations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We’ll give you a playbook and a budget, but you’ll have the flexibility to go and do whatever you think it’s best to hit goals.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This means you’ll need a strategic vision, but on-the-ground execution and <em>some </em>combination of the following skills: personalized cold outreach at scale, sales, paid advertising, content marketing, SEO, copywriting, or marketing ops.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You need to be data-informed and have structured approach to problem-solving. We don’t care about A/B testing (<em>just yet</em>) but you do need to figure out what works and what doesn’t in Germany.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the Growth Team is distributed around the world, you should have very strong communication and organizational skills. Remote working experience is a bonus, but if you’ve never worked from home, that’s fine too. Finally, you should be fluent in German and English.</div><div><br></div><div>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We are already a diverse bunch, but each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>Who you’ll be working with (and from where)</strong></h3><div>You’ll work primarily with (and report to) <strong>Gonz</strong>, our Head of Growth, to plan out growth efforts. He is based in Barcelona, but travels quite a bit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll also work with Maria, our Content Strategist, and Angie, our SDR. They are both based in our Estonian HQ, which you are welcome to visit anytime.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, you’ll be working hand-by-hand with our Immigration Lead in Germany. He is based in Munich, and just joined our team. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As our German Growth Country Manager, you’ll be (ideally) based in Germany but as long as you speak German fluently and are familiar with business practices over there, we're good. Some travel to Germany might be required.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the pay and benefits</strong></h3><ul><li>Great compensation. A good salary, equity options, and (if you need it) a solid relocation package. Obviously.</li><li>Self-care budget. A budget for books, gym, and Uber rides for when you want to treat yourself to a night out.</li><li>Tools for the job. A computer, monitor, headphones, and other hardware you might need to work comfortably.</li><li>Time for yourself. 28 days of paid vacation, 3 mental health days a year, and generous parental leave.</li><li>Flexible Work. Work from home or in our spacious office in the coolest part of town.</li><li>Annual offsite in Tallinn. Karaoke included.</li></ul></div>",

Do you live on social media 24/7 and wouldn’t dream of being out of touch for more than a few hours? Are you primarily a people organizer, with the ability to plan a schedule and get others to stick to your timeline? Would you be psyched to manage a social media community of smart, successful women seeking dating, relationship, and confidence advice?</div><div><br></div><div>Well, you might be the rock star social media process manager we’re looking for.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a critical role on our team that requires a super organized, independent self-starter. We need you to not be shy about keeping others — even our CEO — to a schedule. If you need a lot of hand holding, you won’t be a great fit for this role.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s also not a content creation role — we’re using existing content that Matthew creates, and someone else will be delivering that weekly. Your process management, organizational, and teamwork skills, as well as your flexibility, will be more important than anything in this role.</div><div><br></div><div>The qualities we’re looking for include:</div><div><br></div><div>– High level of organizational skills and ability to organize others</div><div>– Process mindset and ability to see the big picture from a linear, process-driven perspective and organize others within that</div><div>– Confidence, but no ego</div><div>– Ability to keep others on schedule, no fear in your project management skillset</div><div>– Lots of flexibility&nbsp;</div><div>– High digital availability and willingness to grow with us</div><div>– Passion for and devotion to the work we do and our community</div><div>– Dependability</div><div>– Prior experience as a freelancer preferred</div><div>– Two years of social media management experience preferred (bonus points if it’s for a media personality)</div><div><br></div><div>Responsibilities include:</div><div><br></div><div>– Process managing two designers, a video editor, and our CEO to get posts planned, ready, and scheduled (we have someone else who will source &amp; deliver content from our existing library)</div><div>– Finalizing approvals from Matthew&nbsp;</div><div>– Scheduling daily posts and tweets</div><div>– Creating a social media content schedule every month&nbsp;</div><div>– Helping put in place a team to review comments and respond to messages with questions about our programs</div><div>– Willingness to speak up with ideas as well as take final direction where necessary</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Why Join Us?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>You’ll work remotely with a good amount of flexibility. We are 100% remote, with team members based in LA, NY, the UK, Eastern Europe, and Asia.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Make an impact – help women level-up in their relationships, self-esteem, and happiness.</div><div><br></div><div>Be part of a positive, upbeat team that deals with each other with respect and gratitude.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>HOURS</strong></div><div><br></div><div>This role starts as part-time freelance for 20 hours per week, but we are looking for someone who wants to be full time and expect the hours to grow rapidly. Given that most of our customers are in the U.S., we generally work U.S. business hours, so you should have consistent availability within 9 am - 6 pm Eastern time hours (if you’re an early bird and want to work from Pacific Time, or a night owl who wants to work from European hours, we don’t care, but we’ll need to be reliably able to reach you during these hours). You’ll need consistent availability for team video calls between the hours of 11 AM - 3 PM Eastern.</div><div><br></div><div>To be considered, please write a cover letter to recruiting@howtogettheguy.com as to why you’d be a good fit in the body of your email. DO NOT send a CV or other attachments (if you attach ANYTHING to it, your application will automatically not be read). We prioritize culture fit, attention to detail, and superstar-quality writing when selecting candidates.&nbsp;<br><br>You’ll be interviewing with our Customer Support Lead, Courtney. Her favorite color is red, so she’d be pleased if you put that word somewhere in your subject line when sending your letter.</div><div><br></div><div>Looking forward to meeting you!</div></div>",

Our goal is to ultimately re-imagine the way building projects are planned, delivered and operated.</p><br /><p>Over the past year, our three offices (London - HQ, Sarajevo, and Yerevan) have joined forces to build a product and service that our customers love. Now, we&rsquo;re kickstarting our growth across the pond in New York with our newest clients, Tiffany &amp; Co and Aecom Tishman.</p><br /><p>We have ambitions to expand significantly, which means that we are looking for passionate and enthusiastic talent to join our&nbsp;<a class=&quot;external&quot; href='https://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.disperse.io%2Fteam%2F' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>proudly diverse, international team</a>.</p><br /><h3>YOUR ROLE</h3><br /><p>There is no better time to join our growing team, as you will have the rare opportunity to establish yourself as first Product Marketing leader and a core part of our US founding team in New York. The idea is to build out a team that connects the dots between a fantastic product and huge growth potential. Productivity in construction is an age-old problem with enormous opportunity and we&rsquo;re looking for someone ambitious, smart and versatile to help us unlock it. As we expand domestically and globally, the Product Marketing team has a critical role in supporting and enabling our growth.</p><br /><p>We organise the Product Marketing team into two parts, focusing on different core outcomes:</p><br /><p><em>Product Success: Customers understand the problems we solve and the value they get from our products and solutions.</em></p><br /><p><em>Commercial Success: ensuring that we have clearly differentiated value propositions for key audiences, and that our Sales team and Champions in our customers&rsquo; organisations have the tools they need to position and sell easily.</em></p><br /><p>The role will be based in New York with an initial 6-week on-boarding in London and regular travel to the UK and Europe.</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Lead GTM: Define and lead go-to-market strategy and execution &ndash; Build the launch strategy and lead a cross-functional team to see it through to execution</li><br /><li>Define Positioning: Decide on how we position our product in the market and how we message it strategically to different customer cohorts, buyers and user groups</li><br /><li>Lead product marketing efforts: help define the overall market narrative, construct target customer profiles, generate customer case studies and other collateral to support marketing and sales initiatives, and guide communication efforts across multiple audiences and channels</li><br /><li>Drive inbound product marketing - Be the voice of the market through industry research, competitive analysis, quantitative analysis, and structured qualitative feedback from businesses through direct engagement.</li><br /><li>Content Lead: Set priorities for the content production backlog and drive changes to the marketing website, and ensure the availability of high-quality product collateral; produce high fidelity externally-facing content including thought leadership content, customer stories, webinars, data sheets, solution guides, and more for all funnel stages</li><br /><li>Lead Research: Research key market and product data, conduct user interviews to understand key customer segments, their specific needs, and lifecycle stages</li><br /><li>Sales Enablement: Support the sales team by researching and documenting typical customer use cases and proof points, target buyer profiles, and</li><br /><li>Develop innovative marketing strategies to gain C-level and VP mindshare.</li><br /><li>Champion the product messaging and positioning internally, ensuring not only the commercial side of the business is knowledgeable about product and messaging (everyone represents the Disperse brand)</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>OUR CULTURE</h3><br /><p>Ask anyone at Disperse what they love most about working here, and they'll probably tell you &quot;it's the people!&quot;, &quot;the team, of course&quot;, &quot;the people and the Hedwig owls in the offices&quot;.</p><br /><p>As clich&eacute;d as it may sound, we're very proud of the people we have and the close-knit, family culture we've built across London, Sarajevo and Yerevan. Despite the distances, we're united through the passion with which we approach our goals and the fun that we have along the way. We always look out for each other, no matter what. The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.</li><br /><li>We support each other. If a process breaks or if you're struggling, you can always count on the people around you and the people far away from you, to help you get back on track.</li><br /><li>We run on feedback: direct and transparent praise and constructive criticism, communicated with the best of intentions. There is no other way to learn!</li><br /><li>Ideas and approaches are always judged on merit rather than source. We welcome discussions and challenges. This way everyone makes a tremendous impact no matter the role.</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>REQUIREMENTS</h2><br /><p>Although previous product marketing experience is not an absolute requirement, it certainly helps if you&rsquo;ve positioned and messaged enterprise products before.</p><br /><p>We do not currently sponsor work visas for this role, therefore US citizenship or a green card are required from all applicants.</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have a proven track record of delivering tangible results in a product marketing within a B2B technology organisation</li><br /><li>You have been working as a Product Marketing Manager between 3 to 5 years or have demonstrated experience from a similar field</li><br /><li>You have experience of working collaboratively as part of cross-functional teams to take products to market</li><br /><li>You understand what the component parts are, and how to determine them, for a go-to-market strategy.</li><br /><li>You have led projects to gain insight from customers, and understand how to translate this into useful feedback for Business Development, Marketing and Product teams.</li><br /><li>You have a customer service orientation and experience in a client-facing capacity</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Your skills</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You are able to think critically about why having a great product alone is not enough to succeed</li><br /><li>You are comfortable converting complex concepts into clear, engaging messages for internal and external audiences.</li><br /><li>You enjoy tackling challenging problems to ensure continuous improvement.</li><br /><li>You are action-orientated and enjoy making an impact.</li><br /><li>You are comfortable interpreting data and using it to inform decision making.</li><br /><li>You enjoy driving projects from planning and strategy through to execution and analysis of results.</li><br /><li>You are passionate about technology and its ability to solve complex problems</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>BENEFITS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Competitive Salary and generous option package</li><br /><li>Private health insurance.</li><br /><li>25 days&rsquo; holiday plus all federal holidays.</li><br /><li>Friendly, open and transparent culture.</li><br /><li>You'll get to join a passionate startup with proven traction on its international scaling journey.</li><br /><li>Flexible working hours / ability to work from home.</li><br /><li>Free coffee.</li><br /><li>Regular travel to the UK and Europe.</li><br /><li>Regular socials, and team retreats to amazing destinations (Tbilisi, Kiev...

You might be the perfect fit for this full-time, remote position if you are an ambitious and highly-skilled sales and marketing manager, who combines creativity with strategy to develop innovative strategies and campaigns to shape the future of our company.<br><br></div><div><br>Aeolidia is a “one stop shop” design agency that develops brands and creates story-centered ecommerce websites for designers, artisans, and curators that have made it past the startup phase.&nbsp; We pair our custom strategic Shopify websites with analytical insights to continually optimize clients’ sites, resulting in significant growth to their online retail sales.<br><br></div><div><br>Our employees are directly responsible for empowering awesome business owners to succeed, and are challenged with meaningful work that improves their particular skills. If this all sounds excellent to you, please keep reading to see if we might be a match to work together!<br><br></div><div><strong><br>A Bit About Us<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Aeolidia is a graphic design and web development agency that has been working with designer and artisan businesses since 2004. We’re the preeminent design team in our creative niche, and we dig deep into strategy based on information we get from each client’s website analytics while also truly understanding the branding part of it. We deliver a gorgeous AND powerful site every time.<br><br></div><div><br>A designer or artist’s story should be compelling to customers. We focus on storytelling for brands. This is about each business’s “why” and what makes them unique and irreplaceable to their perfect customers. Since we do business naming, brand vision and voice, brand graphic identity, copywriting, and photography in-house, we have the capability to craft a cohesive story without losing anything along the way.<br><br></div><div><br>We are a remote team of overachievers, united in our common goal of taking creative businesses to the next level by paving the way toward substantial increases to online sales.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Now Let’s Talk About You<br></strong><br></div><div><br>As the Sales &amp; Marketing Manager, you’re a critical part of the leadership team. You enjoy leading people, as well as managing the day-to-day sales and marketing operations of a thriving and ever-changing business. You’re creative, charismatic, knowledgeable, and exceptionally well-versed in the latest sales and marketing techniques, as well as tried-and-true practices. You will increase productivity, inspire and motivate junior employees, and optimize our company’s market share.<br><br></div><div><br>Here are just a few ways we see you being successful in the Sales &amp; Marketing Manager role with Aeolidia:<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Diligent Achiever<br></strong><br></div><div><br>You work smartly to deliver a truly top notch experience to your clients. You seek unique solutions, meet each deadline, and just plain get things done. You are a reliable go-getter.<br><br></div><div><br>Capable, persistent, and resourceful, you never despair when you hit a roadblock or need to figure out something new. You give it a try, do the research, try try again, ask for help, test it out, succeed, then consider it a learning experience and a new tool in your kit.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Curious Learner<br></strong><br></div><div><br>You know it would be easy to keep doing what has worked in the past, but you also know that technology changes quickly, each business is different, and what works in one case won’t be the best solution in others.<br><br></div><div><br>You stay abreast of advancements in design, technology, and each specialty area in your role. You value being at the top of your game, even as things change. You have big ideas, and you’re eager to figure out how to do them.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Humble Expert<br></strong><br></div><div><br>It’s important that each member of our team approaches the client relationship from the mindset of a “doctor”—using their years of expertise and insight to prescribe the right solution. This is in sharp contrast to the “waiter” mentality of taking orders and doing what is asked of us.<br><br></div><div><br>You remember that each client knows their business better than you do, and that you have a lot to learn from them. You strike the balance by being authoritative but cooperative and open-minded. You are experienced and your role is to help guide your client down the path to their goal.<br><br></div><div><br>You are highly collaborative and function well within a team. You feel comfortable asking for help and being open about what you don’t yet know. And, in turn, eagerly show up and share the special knowledge you do have without being arrogant about it. You also facilitate a team environment where each member feels the same.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Positive Ally<br></strong><br></div><div><br>You anticipate your clients’ needs and concerns, and take an active role in making them feel comfortable with their brand, their technology, and their next steps.<br><br></div><div><br>When you see a problem you can solve or help with, you leap to action to make progress toward a solution. You take as much responsibility for client dissatisfaction as you can, knowing that you’re the one guiding the relationship and setting expectations.<br><br></div><div><br>You find solutions that are more than just acceptable, but something the client is happy with, and that keeps your relationship with them on a good track.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Creative Supporter<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Your work is meaningful to you. Making a website and getting money is not the satisfying part. You’re in this to watch your clients exceed their goals and feel proud to have contributed.<br><br></div><div><br>You care about and believe in your clients’ businesses. You have a personal connection that makes the journeys of designer and artisan businesses meaningful to you.<br><br></div><div><br>You understand, you relate to, you value and respect each client and their business. With every step on their project, you are aiming to propel your client to where they want to be next.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>A Day in the Life<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Now that we’ve covered what it’s like to work with Aeolidia, let’s chat about what you would be doing on an average day. The full-time Sales &amp; Marketing Manager will work approximately 40 hours per week designing, implementing, and improving sales and marketing strategies. You will be responsible for identifying and targeting new markets, generating new leads, managing the sales and marketing processes, tracking and assessing the effectiveness of each sales and marketing strategy, providing guidance for your team, and removing obstacles and barriers from their path so they can effectively execute the plan.<br><br></div><div><br>As the Sales &amp; Marketing Manager, you will work closely with the CEO/Founder and Director of Operations to ensure the sales and marketing strategies are aligned with the company vision and goals. You will be responsible for translating and communicating the vision and goals to everyone on your team to ensure they understand what is expected of them in their individual roles. You will help drive results by keeping your team focused on the big picture vision and goals, developing team unity, and prioritizing projects so the team can follow through and execute them on schedule. You thrive in the post-project followup (gathering satisfaction surveys, testimonials, case studies, etc.) and understand its role in a successful sales process to attract new clients.<br><br></div><div><br>Every position with Aeolidia is a remote one, meaning you get to work from wherever you are! This also means that you will be leading a remote team. There are no set schedules or hours. Flexible schedules that fit around your life are what we do best. However, of course we do expect all of our team members to meet their goals and project expectations, so we’ll have weekly meetings to check in on progress, celebrate successes and help clear roadblocks that have a tendency to pop up from time to time. In addition to meetings with your supervisor, you’ll also be leading these meetings with your own direct reports, as well as following up on what they have learned from their team members. We want to ensure you (and every team member at Aeolidia) have every chance to be successful in this role and we’re committed to doing our part to make sure you are.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Great Fit For Our Team If:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>You can commit to working 40 hours per week.</li><li>You have a reliable internet connection which allows you to work from anywhere.</li><li>You work closely with the CEO/Founder and Director of Operations to help bring the goals of the company to life through the sales and marketing processes.</li><li>You’re an experienced and confident leader, comfortable with overseeing multiple team members, setting expectations, discussing project goals and outcomes, delegating and handling difficult conversations in a timely manner when they’re needed, all while keeping the company vision in the forefront.</li><li>You’re not someone who settles for the status quo.

This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.<br />Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours. Across the UK, connected communities are simply not happening.<br />This is where School Space comes in.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - How</strong><br />Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays.<br />We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the center of a thriving community.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - Team</strong><br />Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 7 years, and recent success includes investment raises, 29 partner schools, over half a million generated for them. We&rsquo;ve been on the Techstars 2018 Cohort, been nominated for Social Enterprise UK&rsquo;s Social Enterprise of the Year, and picked up a few awards and amazing networks along the way. Our team are committed to the n th degree and full of the belief that social business is the model of the future. We have endless determination to see School Space grow fast and well, scaling our impact across the UK and beyond. In the mix we have Oxbridge graduates, marathon runners, a pilot, industry veterans, an Olympic torch bearer and a man who once ran a marathon with no training/trainers for an onion bhaji.</p><br /><p><strong>Community Manager</strong><br /><strong>The Role - Why</strong><br />We have an incredible local team that need training, inspiring and leading. You<br />will be responsible for leading a group of up to 80 Community Connectors (part<br />time staff who work based at our schools in the evenings and weekends). You will<br />have administrative support but lead the direction and engagement strategy to<br />ensure our team are empowered with the tools to do their job, with a focus on<br />retention.</p><br /><p><br /><strong>The Role - How</strong><br /><strong><em>Key responsibilities include:</em></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Line Management - whilst most of our remote team work between 5-15 hours per week, they need a point of contact, and you must master supporting them individually whilst drawing on others in your team to balance this responsibility</li><br /><li>Developing and Leading an engagement strategy - our Community Connectors (CCs) already engage via weekly videos from the co-founders and use slack to communicate, but we want you to revamp their &lsquo;journey&rsquo; as a School Space team member, developing the touchpoints they should have to feel supported throughout their lifetime with us</li><br /><li>Developing a training programme - you would be responsible for starting the &lsquo;School Space Academy&rsquo;, which will involve training new starters and providing refreshers for existing staff members.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong><em>What we want from you:</em></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Comfort in working evenings and weekends, as training will have to be done in these hours (expectation; minimum one weekend a month, taken in lieu)</li><br /><li>Experience in leading communities, or managing large groups of people to success.</li><br /><li>A track record of developing a strategy yourself and seeing it through</li><br /><li>Empathy and excellent people skills - an ability to manage but also inspire via &lsquo;low touch&rsquo; methods including innovative techniques</li><br /><li>The ability to self-start and self manage, to bring your own ideas to the table and manage them from start to finish</li><br /><li>Excellent time management and prioritisation skills</li><br /><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills, comfortable with using basic tech tools such as slack</li><br /><li>The ability and desire to work in a fast-paced, challenging environment with peers who challenge you to constantly improve</li><br /><li>An eagerness to take on more responsibility, and you thrive on change - we are a start up and that means things are fast moving.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. </strong><strong>We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, </strong><strong>gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability </strong><strong>status.</strong></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p>",

This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.<br />Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours. Across the UK, connected communities are simply not happening.<br />This is where School Space comes in.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - How</strong><br />Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays.<br />We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the center of a thriving community.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - Team</strong><br />Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 7 years, and recent success includes investment raises, 29 partner schools, over half a million generated for them. We&rsquo;ve been on the Techstars 2018 Cohort, been nominated for Social Enterprise UK&rsquo;s Social Enterprise of the Year, and picked up a few awards and amazing networks along the way. Our team are committed to the n th degree and full of the belief that social business is the model of the future. We have endless determination to see School Space grow fast and well, scaling our impact across the UK and beyond. In the mix we have Oxbridge graduates, marathon runners, a pilot, industry veterans, an Olympic torch bearer and a man who once ran a marathon with no training/trainers for an onion bhaji.</p><br /><p><strong>Community Manager</strong><br /><strong>The Role - Why</strong><br />We have an incredible local team that need training, inspiring and leading. You<br />will be responsible for leading a group of up to 80 Community Connectors (part<br />time staff who work based at our schools in the evenings and weekends). You will<br />have administrative support but lead the direction and engagement strategy to<br />ensure our team are empowered with the tools to do their job, with a focus on<br />retention.</p><br /><p><br /><strong>The Role - How</strong><br /><strong><em>Key responsibilities include:</em></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Line Management - whilst most of our remote team work between 5-15 hours per week, they need a point of contact, and you must master supporting them individually whilst drawing on others in your team to balance this responsibility</li><br /><li>Developing and Leading an engagement strategy - our Community Connectors (CCs) already engage via weekly videos from the co-founders and use slack to communicate, but we want you to revamp their &lsquo;journey&rsquo; as a School Space team member, developing the touchpoints they should have to feel supported throughout their lifetime with us</li><br /><li>Developing a training programme - you would be responsible for starting the &lsquo;School Space Academy&rsquo;, which will involve training new starters and providing refreshers for existing staff members.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong><em>What we want from you:</em></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Comfort in working evenings and weekends, as training will have to be done in these hours (expectation; minimum one weekend a month, taken in lieu)</li><br /><li>Experience in leading communities, or managing large groups of people to success.</li><br /><li>A track record of developing a strategy yourself and seeing it through</li><br /><li>Empathy and excellent people skills - an ability to manage but also inspire via &lsquo;low touch&rsquo; methods including innovative techniques</li><br /><li>The ability to self-start and self manage, to bring your own ideas to the table and manage them from start to finish</li><br /><li>Excellent time management and prioritisation skills</li><br /><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills, comfortable with using basic tech tools such as slack</li><br /><li>The ability and desire to work in a fast-paced, challenging environment with peers who challenge you to constantly improve</li><br /><li>An eagerness to take on more responsibility, and you thrive on change - we are a start up and that means things are fast moving.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. </strong><strong>We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, </strong><strong>gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability </strong><strong>status.</strong></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The<br />income generated is used by the schools to improve the educational experience<br />and facilities for their students, in addition to building stronger connections with<br />the surrounding community. Having recently raised significant investment we are<br />entering a period of rapid growth which will see us head towards our goal of giving<br />&pound;7m in income back to our schools by 2020.</p><br /><p><strong>Our culture</strong><br />We strongly believe that our people are at the heart of our success. From weekly<br />update videos from the founders, to regular training days, daily stand-ups, socials<br />and unexpected &lsquo;magic moments&rsquo;. Our core values are Transparency, Positivity,<br />Initiative, Community, Drive/Passion and Learning. We are driven to improve and<br />develop every team member at School Space and actively encourage all team<br />members to proactively contribute to our culture.</p><br /><p><br /><strong>Our impact</strong><br />In the last 12 months, we&rsquo;ve generated over half a million pounds for our partner<br />schools. That equates to 200,000+ free school meals, 40 additional teaching<br />assistants, 85,000 footballs but importantly, a brighter future for those schools.</p><br /><p><strong>Our story</strong><br />In 2010, our founders, James and Jemma, became part of Wheatley Park School&rsquo;s Head Boy and Girl Team.

Below is some basic info about us and the role, so you know what you’re getting into.</p><p><strong>About AirDev</strong></p><p>We founded AirDev to change how custom software is made. Our goals are to dramatically lower the technical and financial barriers to making technical products and to enable people without traditional coding skills to make a good living building those products.</p><p>Co-founders Andrew and Vlad were some of the original Bubble users in 2013, and were amazed at the web platforms they could build without a technical background. They started AirDev in 2015 as the first Bubble agency, building apps for clients of all shapes and sizes.</p><p>We’ve grown significantly since and now help hundreds of clients all over the globe, from one-person startups to large enterprises, build high-quality software in a matter of weeks.</p><p><strong>About the role and its responsibilities</strong></p><p>Product Owners act as the Head of Product/CTO for our clients, helping them think through their idea and turn it into concrete requirements that our developers and designers can execute on. Their primary task is to create a product that’s as good as possible while ensuring that it’s scoped to meet the client’s timeline and budget. Their specific responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>Discuss the project with the client and determine what functionality is needed</li><li>Help the client think through their different options, corner cases, and simplest ways to build something</li><li>Research answers to technical questions that involve API integrations or complex workflows</li><li>Put together detailed specifications and wireframes based on the project requirements as well as our standards</li><li>Work with the development and design teams to execute on the project, providing feedback and guidance as needed</li><li>Help the client iterate on the product based on data, development best practices, and customer feedback</li></ul><p><strong>Qualities we look for</strong></p><p>We value a mix of hard and soft skills, as well alignment to our core values in all of our people. Some specific qualities for this role include:</p><ul><li>Excellent communication skills: Product Owners spend majority of their time interacting with clients, so they need to be very clear and structured in both verbal and written communication.</li><li>Product sense and commitment to simplicity: We see a large range of ideas and Product Owners should be able to quickly figure out the simplest way to turn those ideas into products, no matter what the industry or application.</li><li>Analytical skills: Designing software can be quite complex, so we look for strong conceptual and logical thinkers.</li><li>Software Experience: Ideal candidates will have 2+ years of experience building software, using Bubble or code (as either a developer or Product Manager).</li><li>Time management and being task-oriented: We work with lots of clients at once and always stick to our deadlines, which requires diligence and constantly moving the ball forward.</li><li>Enjoy intellectual &amp; creative challenges: Finding the right technical solution to a human need is both an art and a science, and those who enjoy solving complex problems tend to be best suited for this role.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.airdev.co/job/product-owner-1564508510522x591534616877203500' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Come on board if you want to pull weight atone of the most interesting young technology companies to come out ofCambridge.</p><p><b>SpecificDuties and Responsibilities</b></p><p><i>GrowthSprints</i></p><p>DataSwiftis developing a growth and marketing engine targeting developers, startups, andother fast-growing businesses. You will contribute weekly to the businessdevelopment and marketing sprints, working with the Head of Growth andMarketing and CCO to develop a scalable engine of growth.  If Eric Ries said it, we’re doing it.</p><p><i>ExternalComms</i></p><p>Yourtools will be the websites, social channels, and emails that we use every dayto have conversations with our users, and in our weekly growth sprints you willuse them to learn more about all our awesome customers. You will need to write,joke, chat, listen, and empathise with them, and will hold the face of ourcompany in your purview.</p><p><i>Reportingand Insights</i></p><p>TheWeekly Growth Sprints are our primary tool for generating all of the HAT’s newbusiness, and the Head of Growth and Marketing that you’ll be working with isresponsible for reporting on how well that work is going to the wholecommercial team, our developers and engineers, and of course the CEO andexecutive. You’re going to help - we’ll all work together like a little hitsquad to make sure we learn as much as we possibly can about our customers.</p><p><b>Skills,Qualifications and Experiences:</b></p><p><i>Communications–</i> you are joining an elite (*buffs nails*) team of early business-sidestartuppers, working on the hardest job in startups: early-stage growth. Good,no, great communication is essential. If you’ve never worked in startups beforethat’s ok too - we’ll teach you everything you need to know. Which reminds me…</p><p><i>Learning-</i> very, very few people have elite-level experience in high-growth startups. Ifyou do (awesome, come work with us!!) you know that learning is a huge part ofthe job. If you don’t this is going to be a place where you can pick uphundreds if not thousands of new skills, and really stretch your abilities.Sound fun?</p><p><i>Timemanagement –</i> we have too much to do, and you will too. If you can work wellunder pressure and manage your time and tasks efficiently, you’re going to loveit here.</p><p><i>Marketing–</i> ultimately, our job is to know and love our customers. The more we get them,the easier they’ll be to find, onboard, and make happy, which is the whole jobof a new startup like ours. That’s how we think marketing really works at thisstage of growth. Sure, we may use websites and social and advertising to dothat work, but it’s a communications job at heart.</p><p><i>Problem-solving–</i> no one has ever (!!) sold our product before, and no one we’re selling to hasever bought it before. This job is all about problem solving. If you’re good atpuzzles, or can’t rest when you have a juicy conundrum in front of you, thisjob will give you a lot of satisfaction.</p><p><b>What’sin it for you:</b></p><p>Thisis an entry-level role paying £20,000-30,000 a year, and you’ll earn equity aswell. You’ll work in a fast-paced environment with a lot of flexibility, andyou can more or less work as remotely as you like. You’ll get some expensescovered, you’ll have lot’s of opportunities for advancement, and you’ll bejoining us right after we’ve raised Seed (and before Series A), which is almostthe perfect time to join a young Startup. You’ll have a lot of responsibilitiesand you’ll learn a ton.</p><p><b>The pitch from us:</b></p><p>This is a chance to work on the most important problems in tech: data problems. You can fix Cambridge Analytica and help pioneer the future of the digital economy.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll work with a young, driven growth team with a range of skills. You can also help shape that team, as we're still small and are building our internal culture.&nbsp;</p><p>We have good flexibility. We can foster remote working and we have family-friendly setups and understanding for our teams. We're very international as well, with team members from Canada, the UK, Malaysia, Greece, and Germany.&nbsp;</p><p>Things are going to move quickly here, and&nbsp;your personal development is one of our big focuses, and so is the development of our team as we onboard our new customers.&nbsp;You're joining the company right at Seed stage - so stable enough to be responsible, but young enough for there still to be lots of responsibility to go around.&nbsp;</p><p>We cultivate a culture of open-mindedness and flexibility with discipline and hard work. On top of a competitive salary, you get financial perks like equity, and the responsibilities of leadership. We're building a representative team and you'll work under one of the highest-paid female academics and CEOs in the UK. Hope you can join us.</p>",

To that end, we build technology for both voters and election administrators that simplifies the process and ensures that no voter should ever have to miss an election.</p><p>TurboVote helps voters register, stay registered, and cast a ballot in every election, from municipal to national. TurboVote served more than 5 million voters in 2018 by building the largest college, nonprofit, and corporate voter engagement coalition in the country, including more than 300 campuses, companies like Starbucks, Univision, Facebook, Google, Snapchat, and dozens more.</p><p>We also manage the The Voting Information Project, which coordinates with state election offices to publish nationally-standardized information about where and how to votedata that powers everything from Googles polling place search to our own text message and email reminders to TurboVote users, and received over 120 million impressions in 2016. Ballot Scout helps election administrators track absentee ballots through the mail, providing transparency in the vote-by-mail process and making it easier to follow up when things go awry. And in 2018, we became the organizational home of the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED).</p><p><strong>Software Development at Democracy Works</strong><br>These products are the work of our 14-developer team. Most of our development involves writing microservices in Clojure running in Docker containers on Kubernetes and hosted on AWS. These services communicate over RabbitMQ and store their data in Datomic. Our users primarily interact with web apps written in ClojureScript and re-frame. We also have projects that use JavaScript, Node, React, Python, and PostgreSQL.</p><p>We pair program, collaborate with product managers, and make sure our efforts deliver value to voters. We define specialized roles and projects on each team so that everyone gets a variety of experience and working relationships and can bring their unique strengths to as wide a swath of our work as possible.</p><p><strong>Where you fit in</strong><br>As CTO, you’ll be helping Democracy Works consolidate our recent growth and prepare for even larger-scale work in 2020 and beyond. In 2018, TurboVote scaled from 1 million to 6 million voters served, and did so with the help of some new tools, from Kubernetes to Twilio Studio. In 2019, were considering how our datasets and products can best improve the voting experience in the years to come, and what infrastructure we still need to build to get there. Our technical work will include removing additional bottlenecks to scale, resolving code debts incurred in the election season, and standardizing how our various projects are deployed, documented, and supported. Were grappling with questions of balancing scale and cost, building core infrastructure while also shipping new features, when and where to introduce specialization within our technical teams, and how to unify our many tools to best support our mission.</p><p><strong>You will:</strong></p><ul><li>Join communities of voter engagement experts and election administrators, and work with our leadership team to define how our data and tools can best support better democratic participation</li><li>Collaborate with our VP Engineering and employee engagement team to ensure that our recruitment, professional development, and people-management all support a diverse and effective developer team</li><li>Develop and implement policies and best practices to maximize the security of our data and applications</li><li>Review and approve architectural decisions with an eye toward standardizing practices across programs and products</li><li>Communicate directly with senior leadership, individual developers, and product leads to understand and support their needs and goals</li></ul><p><strong>You are:</strong></p><ul><li>A skilled communicator who takes pride in distilling complex concepts into simple components</li><li>A strategic planner capable of translating an ambitious mission into architecture, process, and code</li><li>Creative, in the way that sees constraints and trade-offs as puzzles to solve rather than obstacles to success</li><li>Curious, excited to learn about the areas of our work that youre not already familiar with</li><li>Empathetic, a decision-maker who considers how our choices can affect voters, developers, and stakeholders</li><li>Someone who enjoys wearing multiple hats and bringing different disciplines together in pursuit of a goal</li></ul><p><strong>You have experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Building, deploying, and scaling complex products</li><li>Managing others we expect that this role will have only two direct reports, but will be involved in personnel decisions affecting many others</li><li>Learning and using a wide range of technologies and tools</li><li>Both in a developer role and (ideally) in other positions, whether product, design, or leadership</li><li>Working closely with non-engineering colleagues</li></ul><p><strong>Physical demands</strong></p><p>This position requires regular, daily use of a computer.</p><p>Democracy Works is committed to diversity and inclusion in everything we do and aspires to have a team that’s representative of the voters we serve.

One of our core behaviors is to lead by serving others, and we’re looking for a people-focused manager to help define what that looks like. Our team has recently grown from 5 to 10 individual contributors in a few months in order to support our customers and unlock more opportunities.</p><p>This is a full-time, salaried position that includes equity, health, dental, and vision benefits. In addition to these benefits, we offer awesome perks that reflect our commitment to the physical and mental well-being of every member of our team. Enjoy a $1,000 bonus for taking your first vacation over 5 days with us, a monthly stipend for health and wellness expenses, flexible parental leave, and more. Compensation will vary based on where you’ll work from — the base range for San Francisco is $170,000 – $190,000.</p><p>Note: You’ll need valid U.S. work authorization to join us.</p><p><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></p><ul><li>Build relationships of trust and psychological safety with your reports.</li><li>Help your reports uncover a growth plan based on their interests and aptitude, identifying the right strategy to help them achieve that plan (whether it’s sponsoring them for an opportunity, or coaching them on specific skills).</li><li>Create a positive environment where your team feels safe to communicate openly, share constructive criticism and contribute innovative ideas.</li><li>Help resolve conflicts between your reports and their peers, coaching them on radical candor and stepping in when necessary.</li><li>Establish strong partnerships with your cross-functional peers in each product area that your reports work on, improving collaboration and trust for your reports.</li><li>Contribute to and drive initiatives to codify operations and processes that help the design team produce work they’re proud of.</li><li>Help recruit and retain talented designers, staffing them on teams that leverage their strengths and provide opportunities for growth.</li></ul><p><strong>We’d love to hear from you if: </strong></p><ul><li>You believe in people management through servant leadership, and view the success and fulfillment of your reports as your primary goal. (This is not a Creative Director position where you tell your reports what to do.)</li><li>You apply a user-oriented design process to managing a team. You ask questions and receive buy-in before making decisions that will impact your reports.</li><li>You understand when to be supportive, when to be directive, and when to sponsor your reports.</li><li>You have a strong understanding of a designer’s career levels (from entry-level through senior roles) and how each person has different strengths. You know how to level and an incoming candidate, staffing them on the appropriate team, and have successfully helped individual contributors get promoted.</li><li>You’ve helped struggling performers get back on track or find a new opportunity.</li><li>You practice radical candor and know how to coach others situationally.</li><li>You can navigate a company building a complex tool with many moving parts.</li><li>You understand management is not a one-size-fits-all solution, that every report needs a different approach at different stages in their career, but also believe that standardized operations can help set consistent expectations.</li><li>You have managed a team of designers in a full-time role.

So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

We help them send automated messaging that their customers actually like to receive. If that’s exciting to you, we should talk.</p><p>Our current team includes designers who are passionate about developing our design system and improving our visual design. We would love to add a Product Designer with a specific interest in solving the complex user experience problems in our product.</p><p><strong>About Customer.io</strong></p><p>We believe that businesses who create strong relationships with their customers will outperform the ones who don’t.</p><p>Were working to make Customer.io the default choice for any internet business to deliver great, automated customer experiences at scale. Customer.io is used by over 1200 businesses to create continuity after a person leaves a website or mobile app. Every message (receipts, win-backs, and onboarding) across every channel (email, push, sms and more) can be managed and measured in Customer.io.</p><p><strong>What will you be doing as Product Designer?</strong></p><ul><li>Sketching exploratory designs and customer journeys for new features.</li><li>Building high fidelity mockups and sharing opinionated design proposals in Slack and Notion.</li><li>Collecting and acting on feedback from your peers and our customers.</li><li>Pairing with developers to bring ideas to life in interactive prototypes.</li><li>Iterating on our design system by making improvements to foundational styles, components, and processes.</li></ul><p><strong>Examples of some recent projects we’ve worked on:</strong></p><ol><li>Transitioning all of our page layouts to card-based layouts to help users focus on content.</li><li>Designing a drag-and-drop workflow builder so people can visualize complex automated messaging workflows.</li><li>Discussing and writing guidelines for our take on accessibility (check it out in our WIP design system documentation)</li></ol><p><strong>What will you bring to the table?</strong></p><ul><li>If you identify as a UX or UI designer, that’s okay. We don’t care much about labels.</li><li>The most important thing: You have a deep interest in finding ways to&nbsp;<strong>improve UX in complex flows</strong>&nbsp;and features.</li><li>You have a solid understanding of&nbsp;<strong>interaction design</strong>&nbsp;methods and best practices (including journey mapping, human computer interaction, and animations).</li><li>You have&nbsp;<strong>a growth mindset</strong>&nbsp;and are willing to challenge our team and propose changes to how we do things.</li><li>You&nbsp;<strong>genuinely care about understanding the outcomes of products you work on</strong>&nbsp;and will make design decisions that protect our customers and their end-users.</li><li>You can&nbsp;<strong>present your work clearly</strong>&nbsp;to an asynchronous team.</li><li>You have&nbsp;<strong>experience in user research</strong>&nbsp;and usability testing practices.</li></ul><p><strong>And bonus if you have these skills too:</strong></p><ul><li>Ability to level-up our copy strategy.</li><li>Experience working with SVGs and creating illustrations.</li><li>Visual design acumen (color, typography, iconography).</li><li>Understanding of HTML, CSS, and git.</li></ul><p><strong>Why should you work with Customer.io?</strong></p><p>We’re in a special moment as a company: small enough where you’ll have a big impact as an individual, big enough to have resources to conquer ambitious goals as a team, yet calm about how we set growth goals.</p><p><strong>We are a remote-first company – we have employees in Australia, the United States, India, and beyond. We meet up twice a year to get to know each other,&nbsp;</strong>but prioritize asynchronous communication strategies that help us build strong relationships from wherever we choose to work.</p><p>We do a lot of research to ensure everyone is paid well and think our new Product Designer will be paid around $90,000-$110,000, but will adjust for experience. Check out our career’s page for more information on our great benefits and why you should come work with us!</p><p><strong>Diversity statement</strong></p><p>We want to build and maintain a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment where everyone has the opportunity to learn, mentor, and grow. We know that diverse teams make better products, and especially encourage applicants from underrepresented groups to apply if you have any questions, please let us know. We want people with different backgrounds from the team we have today to bring their perspective and thoughtfulness to the work that we do and the culture were always working to build.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/customerio/jobs/1806501' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

You ask a lot of questions. You’re decisive.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>As Community Manager at MitoHQ, your primary job is to understand our customer— what motivates them, what makes their job difficult, and what simply delights them. You will take these constant and ongoing learnings and deftly apply them to the way we position our brand and movement to the world. After all, social business is at its very core, all about people.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your previous experience growing a highly engaged community will enable you to oversee the customer engagement through all social channels.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Sometimes you’ll be looking at our community management from a high level view—say, determining our key objectives for the quarter or the year. Other days, you may be down in the weeds yourself, slicing content to suit each channel or working with others on the marketing team to run A/B conversion tests on site. You’re comfortable—and happy—doing both.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>What you don’t know, you’ll openly admit, but then you’ll get to work figuring it out (asking others for help and/or digging deep on your own). Your self-motivation and a relentless drive to learn/do more are appreciated by all. You pride yourself on being a “clever thinker”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re comfortable talking with and working alongside our operations, marketing and leadership teams. You understand your critical part in the overall machine, graciously accepting thoughts and feedback from others while offering your own expertise where you can. You pride yourself on being “overly communicative” -- keeping everyone up to date with the latest social marketing wins, losses, and initiatives.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You are comfortable working remotely as part of a small team, with a high level of autonomy. You can devise your own schedule and effectively manage your workload based on the biggest opportunities and company objectives.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>When you’re in the wrong or make a mistake you can admit it. You can articulate why it happened and how you’ve learned from the experience.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your timezone location is not important as long as you are available for calls with leadership during business hours in Sydney Australia.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Above all, you understand that your success—and our success—hinges on the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h5><span>Corner the market[ing]</span></h5><br></div><div><span>MitoHQ is a social enterprise and is driven by community.

Failures are learnings.</li><li><b>Integrity</b>- Keep your word. Be whole and complete.</li><li><b>Growth</b>- A hunger for professional improvement.

Understanding that what you do has value.</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>We are also one of the early adopters of the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)</b>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well-rounded team members and flexible thinkers; those who can survey a wide range of sources, synthesize key insights and recommend actionable strategies to propel GorillaDesk into the future.</div><div><br></div><div><b>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our job descriptions, including this one, are regularly updated via small iterations.&nbsp;</b>As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</div><div><br></div><div><i>'Most startups believe in iteration of their products.

By the end of this phase, you will have a clear vision and direction, and all the building blocks you need to build your first end-to-end sales funnel. The activities that will help you during this phase include:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Buyer Persona Identification</li><li>Sales Pitch Development</li><li>Brand Visual Development</li><li>Brand Messaging</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>Phase 2:&nbsp;</b>Bridge the gap between GorillaDesk and the people who want to buy from us.

This is a dream job for anyone who enjoys monitoring political developments, quickly pulling together a plan, writing fast, and getting fired up about holding politicians and corporate executives accountable.</p><p>We are a small but powerful activism team. Our vision: a world where everyone can access the Internet affordably, free of interference and censorship and with full privacy. To accomplish this, we are using the Internet in innovative ways to mobilize people on a scale previously thought to be impossible. We’ve built the technology and created the messaging behind the largest online protests in history, including organizing the campaign that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014. Just last month, we garnered over 6 million views while livestreaming the Congressional debate over the Save the Internet Act, generating tens of thousands of phone calls and letters to Congress.</p><p>We work on a number of issues at the intersection of technology and human rights, from facial recognition surveillance to the use of Artificial Intelligence in the criminal justice system to protecting net neutrality (also known as the free speech fight of our generation) to defending decentralized technologies and alternatives. Our model of activism relies on a relentless focus on strategy and working toward specific wins; campaigning that taps into the power of the Internet; and the ability to speak with a strong voice online. <strong>We are a fully remote organization and you would work from home or a shared work space.</strong></p><p>We’re looking for smart and strategic candidates with excellent writing skills and the drive to make urgent but critical wins on a quick timeline.</p><p>Your day-to-day could include generating an avalanche of phone calls on the issue to a decision-maker or generating so much media media coverage that a C.E.O resigns.</p><p><strong>More specifically, you will be:</strong></p><ul><li>Identifying, monitoring, and analyzing political developments around Internet freedom and tech policy issues related to our campaigns and policy positions at the state, federal, and international level.</li><li>Quickly assessing the opportunity (good or bad) and what role FFTF should play, who the key decision-makers are, and which actions would be most strategic, coordinating closely with the campaigns team. Work closely with FFTF’s Deputy Director and Campaign Director around strategic responses and coordinate new positions as needed.</li><li>Creating high-quality, engaging communications materials including mass emails and SMS, news pitches, campaign pages, event materials, and social media content.</li><li>Acting as a spokesperson to the media on our campaigns when needed.</li><li>Working with designers and developers as a project manager of websites, campaign actions, and more.</li><li>Supporting other organizational needs such as staff and volunteer recruitment, fundraising, and special projects.</li></ul><p><strong>What we’re looking for in you:</strong></p><ul><li>You have at least three years of experience in relevant fields which include communications, campaigns, advocacy, grassroots organizing, digital marketing, or journalism.</li><li>You have experience in campaigning and understand what it takes to move the needle, the messaging that will move people, and the steps to get us there.</li><li>You have significant writing experience and love to write, especially for large audiences, including online audiences and traditional media. You can synthesize complex ideas into concise, easily understandable copy for the web. Your writing can speak to people’s humor, fears and what gets both their head nodding and heart pumping.</li><li>You are familiar with the pace of news cycle and understands how quickly you need to move and hard you need to hustle to ensure our voice is heard.</li><li>You have experience generating media coverage on campaigns including developing relationships with traditional media sources.</li><li>You have experience at generating media coverage on campaigns, including writing press materials and reaching out and developing relationships with traditional media sources.</li><li>You have experience with and a commitment to working with people from a variety of backgrounds, including racial, ethnic, socio-economic, and religious backgrounds, and people from the LGBTQ community.</li><li>You are fascinated by the power of the Internet and have used it in creative ways.</li><li>You have a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on a wide range of political issues. You are a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an idea out of ordinary interaction and someone’s frustrations/struggles.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for:</strong></p><ul><li>A background working on digital campaigns that grow fast.</li><li>Previous experience in Internet or digital rights policy and issues.</li><li>Experience and comfort with working remotely.</li><li>Coding, web design, or marketing skills.</li><li>An commitment to an interest outside of your professional life, such as art, music, sports, hiking, or the outdoors.</li></ul><p><strong>Who you will work with:</strong></p><p>As FFTF’s Communications Specialist, you will work closely with the organization’s Executive Director and Deputy Director who have a combined 30+ years in campaigning, our campaigns staff, and a world class designer and senior software engineer which will position you well to build the tech needed on any campaign. Our team comes from a variety of backgrounds — including startups, the music industry, and campaign organizations. We’re looking for well-rounded individuals who have a range of interests, can do a little bit of everything, and know what they’re really good at! We pride ourselves on being a welcoming place to work for women, the LGBTQ community, people of color, people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, as well as parents.</p><p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p><p><strong>This is a full-time position and the range for this position is a total compensation package of $50-$75K</strong>, depending on experience. Benefits include the option for full health care and partially covered dental benefits, the value of which would be included in the total compensation package. Additional benefits include a 401K plan and paid sick, vacation, and federal holidays days. We offer support for remote work, training and mentoring, and a driven, highly collaborative, supportive work environment.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong></p><p><strong>Fight for the Future is a 100% remote organization so no need to commute or relocate. Our staff are based all over the country (and a couple of international locations too) and work in their homes or shared work spaces over video, slack, and through project management tools.</strong></p><p><strong>How to apply:</strong></p><p>In your application, please let us know where you heard about the jobs and include links to or samples of your writing—ideally in situations where you’re writing to persuade a group of people. Include as much relevant information as you like: significant things you’ve accomplished and projects you’ve worked on. Being well-rounded is a plus, so don’t exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren’t activism related (such as starting a business or being a musician).</p><p><em>Fight for the Future is an equal opportunity and inclusive employer. FFTF does not and shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion (creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), disability, marital status, sexual orientation, or military status, in any of its activities or operations. We believe that a diverse staff enables us to better understand and serve our members, audience and community. Women, people of color, and members of low-income, disadvantaged, and LGBTQ communities are strongly encouraged to apply.</em></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://fightforthefuture.applytojob.com/apply/QQ4o7k4R6K/Communications-Specialist-remote-Can-Be-Based-Anywhere-In-The-US' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Today, the GitHub community includes over 36 Million users, and north of 100M user repositories. It is hands-down the largest developer community in the world, and in turn, GitHub has become the most visible and beloved brand in the developer ecosystem.</p><p>In June of 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for $7.5B, a massive, and highly visible acquisition that was officially completed in the fall of 2018. Since then, Satya Nadella has spoken extensively about the responsibility to the developer world that comes with the GitHub acquisition, and Microsoft’s continued commitment to developer freedom. GitHub is operated as an independent business with a developer-first ethos and a completely open approach to ALL clouds. Microsoft already houses more open source code than any company in the world. The goal in the acquisition is simply for GitHub to become the number one company in the developer world!</p><p>The question is now: how do we leverage GitHub’s enormous user community and highly visible brand to continue to build a world-class business, and continue to be the most important company in the world for developers. Given GitHub’s centrality within the developer ecosystem – the most important part of the entire tech ecosystem – the possibilities for GitHub from a product standpoint are nearly limitless. In the past six months GitHub has dramatically accelerated its product and future roadmap to include innovations that further distance GitHub from its competitors.</p><p></p><strong>The Product Marketing Team</strong><p>Product Marketing operates at the intersection of product management, sales, and the larger marketing organization. We collaborate closely with these teams and other areas of the company to clearly communicate the value of our solutions to our users and customers. We support upwards of 100 product ships each year to millions of users and thousands of companies all over the planet. In addition we help shape the overall company strategy and message, including our naming, packaging, and pricing for all products.</p><p></p><strong>On a day-to-day basis, you will:</strong><ul></ul><li>Create clear, differentiated messaging and positioning for our products.</li><li>Work closely with PMM peers to quickly iterate and refine our messaging and content</li><li>Support our product launch process, including company readiness, collateral updates, PR/AR initiatives, digital campaigns, and demand gen programs</li><li>Support the development for content generation across all our properties and campaigns.</li><li>Develop collateral including white papers, blogs, and presentations</li><li>Support the creation of enablement materials such as demos and videos for customer facing teams (sales, sales engineers, consulting, etc)</li><li>Support a rigorous competitive analysis program with deep resources and succinct summaries</li><p></p><strong>You should have:</strong><ul></ul><li>3-7 years of experience in enterprise software, preferably focused on SDLC, open source, or platform technologies</li><li>Demonstrated ability to collaborate on successful projects in a fast-paced entrepreneurial environment</li><li>Ability to influence wide audiences at all levels and work effectively across functions and geographies</li><li>Be comfortable working with data, and embrace of evidence-based practices for marketing</li><li>Strong interpersonal skills; world class written and oral communications skills</li><li>Joy in collaboration with colleagues, sometimes leading, sometimes following</li><li>Solid understanding of developer workflows and tooling</li><li>Experience marketing to developers</li><li>Deep understanding of GitHub, our users, and at least one programming language a major plus.</li><p></p><strong>Who We Are:</strong><p>GitHub is the developer company. Over 36 million people use GitHub to build amazing things together across 100 million repositories. We make it easier for developers to be developers: to work together, to solve challenging problems, to create the world’s most important technologies. We foster a collaborative community that can come together—as individuals and in teams—to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.</p><p></p><strong>What We Value:</strong><p>&nbsp;We believe the best work is done together. &nbsp;We believe in putting people first. &nbsp;We believe in setting the standard for excellence. &nbsp;We believe in making the world a better place through our work. &nbsp;We believe in creating things for the people using them.</p><em>Collaboration:</em><br><em>Empathy:</em><br><em>Quality:</em><br><em>Positive Impact:</em><br><em>Shipping:</em><p></p><strong>Why You Should Join:</strong><p>At GitHub, we constantly strive to create an environment that allows our employees (Hubbers) to do the best work of their lives. We’ve designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily. The other half of our Hubbers work remotely in 18 countries across the globe.&nbsp;</p><a href='https://github.com/about/careers/remote' rel='nofollow'>Here is a complete list of where we can hire!</a><p>We are also committed to keeping Hubbers healthy, motivated, focused and creative.

We embrace diversity and invite applications from people of all walks of life. We don’t discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, disability, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences.

    "content": "Most experienced SaaS sales professionals have participated in a sales training programme at one point in their careers. Famous sales methodologies like MEDDIC, Value Selling and others, have been adopted by thousands of software organisations throughout the world to help sales teams ultimately deliver better results, sometimes to good effect.<br /><br />What often happens though, is that salespeople have forgettable experiences with these programmes and whilst they may show initial enthusiasm, it is common to see a new methodology rigorously followed for a few months, before disappearing out of sight and mind forever.<br /><br />Todays selection of programmes offer valuable learning, but the delivery of programmes can be a poor experience. Trainings are often much too generic, and almost never align with the unique challenges SaaS businesses face, such as preparing for rapid scale, or future acquisition.<br /><br />SAASco seeks a successful SaaS salesperson to help build a better way for companies to implement successful sales methodologies, process and training, by compiling unique programmes which align with business goals and revolutionise the sales function.<br /><br />The perfect co-founder will have experienced great success working with hyper-growth SaaS businesses in a sales capacity - experience of closing six figure deals is essential but seven figure deals will be preferable.<br /><br />Remote working is welcomed but US or UK based persons would be preferred for proximity to SaaS hubs.",

    "content": "Timeular is looking for a *Remote Growth Marketer* to join our growth team in scaling our user base.<br />(Note: this role is 100% remote, you can be based anywhere).<br /><br />We’re looking for someone who treats acquisition as part of the core user experience and therefore is eager to dive deep to find out what our users really need so you can tune every piece of the acquisition and create a smooth and engaging experience starting already from the first touch point.<br /><br />Timeular enables people to improve their time management to create more value for themselves and the people around them. Basically, it’s about helping people to focus on the right things, getting rid of distractions and ultimately create more value in fewer hours, which they hopefully will use to enjoy their life outside of work.<br /><br />As we live what we pray we will not ask you to work a crazy amount of hours. In fact, we try hard to protect your time. In return, we ask you to do your best job every day every 40 hour week.<br /><br />We are a fully remote team of 16 people working from 5 countries and are between 20 and 40 years old. You can work whenever you want but we’re accepting applications only from people living in a timezone somewhere starting from GMT-4 till GMT+2 (GMT-5 till GMT+1 in winter northern hemisphere).<br /><br />*ABOUT THIS ROLE*<br /><br />You’ll be responsible to establish new growth loops and improve current ones to scale our Timeular user base in a sustainable and predictable way. While this is a very broad definition of your long-term goal, here is what you can start with until you have enough insights to come up with your own roadmap.<br /><br />*Improve acquisition conversion rates*<br /><br />* Dive into our Google Analytics and Mixpanel data together with the retention team to understand even better which customer-behaviour we provide the most value for and where are touchpoints we could acquire more of them.<br />* Find, prioritize and run experiments to test your hypothesis for how to improve conversion rates and analyze the outcome. Mainly on our paid ads and on the webshop.<br />* Facebook and Google Ads are currently our main acquisition channels. Support your colleagues in creating more efficient creatives and landing pages or to automate spending.<br /><br />*Align our messaging and content*<br /><br />* We aim to increase our traffic through helpful content that’s worth to be shared. Help us to build and tune a scalable content growth loop.<br />* Find the sweet spot between our users’ voice and our values and make sure all our customer facing communication aligns with that.<br />* We didn’t really invest in SEO so far. If you have strong experience there, it’s all yours and ready to go in order to increase our organic traffic.<br /><br />*Lead people*<br /><br />* Identify and prioritize the biggest issues we should focus our resources next.<br />* Manage the implementation and iteration for solutions you come up with. Write and specify tickets and approve the implementations for release.<br />* Help to find and onboard new people so they can do their best work and support them when they need orientation.<br /><br />We know you can’t perform at your best from day one because everything is new and there is a lot of information to absorb first. That’s why you’ll get assigned an onboarding buddy right after joining Timeular to assist you while getting started with your new challenges and all the questions you might have along the way.<br /><br />*ABOUT YOU AND OUR CULTURE*<br /><br />As we work remotely, we communicate a lot in written form. To help you demonstrate the strong writing skills you’ll need for this role, we’ve made the first part of this application process a written task.<br /><br />We believe that the most time efficient communication style, whether it’s client-facing or with your team members, is to be direct but respectful. We’re honest and transparent to each other and we support each other. So should you.<br /><br />We work in cycles. We prioritize our top challenges and pitch solutions in a two week pre-cycle and then focus on getting the most promising solutions out within 6 weeks in mixed teams that change at every cycle.<br /><br />We are a virtual team, meaning there is physically no-one around you and you should feel comfortable working like this most of the time. While we do a lot to bring people together it’s unavoidable that loneliness and de-motivation might hit you here and there. We have all been through this and have learned a few things.<br /><br />We respect time because time is the most valuable thing we have: we show up, deliver and communicate in time. We respect everyone’s private time unless there is a real urgency.<br /><br />We say no to distractions and focus on the important things. We seek the minimal path with the highest possible output. We single task our way along that path. We keep meetings efficient. Basically, we focus on focus.<br /><br />*ABOUT THE PAY AND BENEFITS*<br /><br />We’re still at the beginning of our journey and therefore can’t afford to pay huge salaries; however we manage that with other benefits, which are mostly about helping you to live a healthy life outside of work.<br /><br />The transparent salary for this role at hiring ranges between $40,000 and $80,000, depending on several factors like the country you’re in (taxes, living costs etc…) and your experience. After one year of working full-time at Timeular you can participate in the employee stock option pool.<br /><br />The benefits we offer are:<br /><br />* Work where, when and how you want as long it is in GMT-4 to GMT+2 (GMT-5 till GMT+1 in winter northern hemisphere).<br />* 50 days of paid holidays (including national holidays) because we’ve learned that time off is the best source for great ideas.<br />* Three paid team retreats per year to spend an incredible time together discovering unique locations and amazing food. All costs covered.<br />* Paid parental leave and a couple more benefits<br /><br />*HOW THE APPLICATION PROCESS WORKS*<br /><br />We care about who you are today, what you have achieved so far and where do you want to go.<br /><br />Our application process is pretty simple: we start with asking you a few questions in written form, you answer them the best you can, we read it and, if we like it, we jump on a call to get to know each other better. If that goes well, we do a test period so we both can verify our expectations and if we both agree, you’re in.<br /><br />As we value good clear writing skills, take your time to send your application. When you see a question with Why, dig deep to find the real root-why before answering. We value if you answer with facts and numbers.<br /><br />When we ask for example tasks, write your reply like you would think aloud: imagine you’re doing the task and walk us through your thinking from the starting point until the outcome.<br /><br />*MAKE YOUR TIME COUNT WITH US AND APPLY*<br /><br />If you made it this far, then we assume you’re interested and are likely a good fit. Please apply and we will send you a form to fill in.<br /><br />As we always get many applications it might take some time till we get back to you after having evaluated all the applications.",
