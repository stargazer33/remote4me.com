The person in this role must love talking and negotiating with people.</p><p>After a six month probationary period – if it is a good fit for everyone – you will be invited to join our sales team officially, where you will become a fully fledged Business Analyst.</p><p>Being a location-independent full time position is one of the many benefits – you’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best, be it the beaches in Thailand, which does have superb 4G connectivity and cheaper cost of living, or in a mountain resort in the Swiss alps – the choice is yours.</p><p><strong>What’s the Opportunity?</strong></p><ul><li>Becoming a Business Analyst makes you a critical part of the team at Empire Flippers.</li><li>You will represent our brand and be the face of Empire Flippers to buyers and sellers while learning skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world.</li><li>Your work ethic and skill set will have a direct impact on our growth. We will open up our Rolodex, offer you training, and give you insights into the online business space that no college course or paid informational product could ever teach you.</li><li>And you won’t be just another employee at a giant corporation.</li><li>You will connect with entrepreneurs running hundreds of sites, as well as entrepreneurs running gigantic global e-commerce brands with name recognition.</li><li>Because of our fast growth, that also means new needs will arise. We will need good, trained “hands on deck” to handle that growth. If we’re a good fit for each other, you can be at the forefront of that growth and take advantage of it.</li></ul><p><strong>What’s This Sales Position Like?</strong></p><p>While we are an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not overly corporate. You’ll work with our entire team to make sure the job gets done. We believe in collaboration, and that means every department in our company comes together to help bring a project to fruition.</p><p>It has been an effective strategy, and has worked well for us.</p><p>When you first come on board as a Business Analyst, you will start learning more about our business before jumping into the job. You will learn everything there is to know about the different kinds of customers we serve in our audience. You will become well versed in all of our processes, from how our deposit system works all the way up to the intricacies of structuring a business acquisition.</p><p>Once you have the basics down, you will use the phone, chat systems, and email to communicate with our audience and will have access to our backend support systems through HubSpot, Zendesk, and our new Platform we’ve recently launched.</p><p>You might be wondering, though … what will your daily work routine really look like once you’re up and going?</p><p>Here is a list of daily tasks we’ll expect from you (though this isn’t an exhaustive list and could change):</p><ul><li>Taking calls with potential sellers and answering their questions on how we go about selling their business</li><li>Calling people who have placed deposits on businesses and guiding them to the next step in our sales funnel</li><li>Contacting warm leads and qualifying them before sending them to the next step (whether that’s making a deposit or talking with one of our Senior Business Analysts)</li><li>Returning emails to potential buyers who are looking at using our marketplace, but still have questions about our process</li><li>Working closely with our Senior Business Analysts to set up our Buyer-Seller Conference Calls</li></ul><p>As a Business Analyst, you will support our Senior Business Analysts as they negotiate deals that are win-wins for both our buyers and sellers.</p><p><strong>What Skills Are Needed?</strong></p><p><strong>What Skills Do I Need?</strong></p><p>We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean we aren’t looking for a certain kind of skill set.</p><p>While no previous work experience is needed, experience in sales is a big plus. Any background in e-commerce or online business is also helpful. However, we are looking to train the right person, so if you don’t have that experience, don’t let it stop you from applying.</p><p><strong>You must love talking and negotiating with people</strong>. You need to be able to pick up the phone and call someone who doesn’t know you and see how they are doing. This isn’t cold-calling, but it won’t be super warm, either. Everyone you call will have opted into our marketplace and given out their phone number, so they will know about Empire Flippers. It is your task to make sure they understand our processes and see why we are someone they want to work with.</p><p><strong>You can spot risks and opportunities.</strong>&nbsp;Every day, you will speak with entrepreneurs about scaling businesses, liabilities, and how good certain assets are as an investment. Over time, you will need to be able to spot what are genuine risks and genuine opportunities for people looking to acquire online businesses. You will need to be able to confidently tell the entire story of a possible acquisition. While investing in online businesses can bring great returns, it can also be a volatile space to play in. We respect our audience’s intelligence by telling them about both the risks and rewards.</p><p><strong>You’re a problem solver.</strong>&nbsp;Selling a business is an intimate experience for most entrepreneurs, especially if it is the first business someone is selling or buying. That means you will face obstacles and challenges. It will be up to you to make sure those challenges are met head-on and solved.</p><p><strong>You’re excited about expanding the Empire Flippers brand</strong>. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. In many ways, we really are changing lives. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.</p><p><strong>What’s the Lifestyle Like?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits!</strong></li><li>We aren’t going to chain you to a cubicle. You’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best. The choice is yours. While we’re an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not a Fortune 500 company. You won’t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our sellers while also helping to increase the number of high-quality businesses that go live on our marketplace.</li><li>When you first start off, you will be training with our Sales team in Lima, Peru for 6 to 8 weeks. You will need to pay your own way to Lima, but after that we will cover the cost of any travel that we require you to do during your six month probationary period.</li><li>You won’t start off making much money.</li><li>For the first six months, you will be paid $2,500 USD per month during the probation period. In addition to this, you’ll get a housing stipend of $700 USD per month for months 1 through 6. While not a lot, it is enough to have an enjoyable time in Lima and many countries around the world. After six months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan. Within 12 months, you can expect to earn $40,000-$46,000 USD per year, and have paid, international healthcare coverage.</li><li>This amount is more than enough to live a very nice lifestyle almost anywhere in the world (within reason).</li></ul><p><strong>Love It. What’s the Catch?</strong></p><ul><li>We love our employees and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table.</li><li>We love to play and travel. A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work hard.</li><li>Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call when you’re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the globe.</li><li>Sometimes we really do work next to the pool. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil early in the morning and late into the night with a 12-hour work day. That isn’t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a client’s series of questions, so you’ll need to be prepared for that.</li><li>A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job.</li><li>We want you to become a long-term employee with us. Ultimately, we want this sales position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company.</li></ul><p><strong>The Details to Keep in Mind</strong></p><p>Remember, we’re not going to throw you into the fire right away.</p><ul><li>When you first come on board, you’re going to learn about our company. We will do a deep dive into how our processes and systems work and teach you about each department within the business.</li><li>As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into the low-level tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later becoming an independent fully fledged Business Analyst.</li><li>The Sales Leadership Team will review every application that comes our way. For those we think would be a good fit, we will schedule an interview with you. Typically, we do two rounds of interviews before we decide.</li><li>The cut-off date for applying is November 15, 2019. That will leave us a month to review all the applications, and give you time if you’re hired to prepare to come out to Lima.</li><li>If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://empireflippers.com/career/business-analyst/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

That&rsquo;s where you come in.</li><br /><li>As Dalia&rsquo;s first dedicated Social Media Manager, you will act as our guru on all social media channels and content.</li><br /><li>Working across multiple teams, you will craft and disseminate stories about our team, our research, and products that generate interest and engagement from our target audiences.

With over 85,000 retrospectives run on our platform, we’re the trusted leader in our market, and we’ve been helping teams continuously improve since 2015.\\n\\nWe’re also a small, cross-functional team of passionate and fun people. We have an outstanding leadership team and a dedication to company culture, so you’ll always feel connected to our mission, even though you can work from anywhere. We’re lucky enough to have an awesome product, great revenue growth, high customer satisfaction, low churn, and a recent round of seed investment. Now, we need someone to help us take our product to the next level!\\n\\nThe right candidate for the Senior Product Designer position at Retrium is someone who has experience in a product-led organization, can translate complex customer problems into elegant solutions, understands best practices for user interface design, and likes to iterate based on research findings and customer feedback. If you’re a creative problem-solver and want to create a compelling experience for thousands of users, then come be a part of our growing team!\\n\\n### Benefits\\n\\nWe provide amazing benefits, and if you ask the team, they’ll tell you that the greatest benefits we offer employees are the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the company and the opportunities to “Listen. Learn. Teach”, another core value.\\n\\nOur other benefits include:\\n\\n- Competitive salary and equity in a fast-growing, funded startup\\n- Health, dental, and vision insurance coverage for you and your family\\n- Unlimited and minimum vacation policy (we encourage you to ask us about this!)\\n- Flexible, sustainable work hours\\n- Work from home or a co-working office\\n- All the equipment you need to do your job\\n- Continuing education and learning opportunities\\n- Annual company retreats\\n\\n### Additional Information\\n\\nRetrium is committed to creating a diverse environment where you can “Be Your Amazing Self”, yet another core value. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n As the first dedicated product designer at Retrium, you’ll help us establish the design processes we’ll use going forward. This means you’ll need to understand the business context, customers, and technical constraints and their impact on design in addition to being a great designer. You’ll work closely with both the engineering and business teams to advocate for design in strategic product decisions and oversee the UI design implementation, so communication and collaboration will be key in this role.\\n\\nBecause you’ll own everything related to design, you’ll need to be well versed in customer research, so that you can share your concepts and get feedback from our users. You’ll translate our product’s mission and these customer research insights into an engaging and simple interface for our retrospective platform. In this role, your goal will be to continuously improve the user experience of our application, so that customers can easily adopt, understand, and interact with our product.\\n\\nDay-to-day, you’ll be responsible for creating mockups, user flows, sketches, wireframes, diagrams, customer journey maps, and other design artifacts needed to guide the product development process. The ability to take ideas from low-fidelity outlines to high-fidelity designs using Sketch, Invision, Figma, Framer, or other relevant tooling, is a big part of this role.\\n\\nBecause our core values include “Default to Autonomy”, “Bias for Action”, and “Level Up”, you’ll need to be a self-starter who can brainstorm possibilities, execute tasks, and lead the implementation of major features and changes to the product. If you want a job that’s integral to a company’s expansion and growth and where there’s opportunities to learn and make a real impact, then this role is for you! \\n\\n# Requirements\\nMore than anything else, we’re looking for a self-motivated person who is passionate about designing a great user experience within Retrium.\\n\\nWe believe that the following collection of experiences and abilities would make someone successful in this position. However, we encourage anyone with 5 or more years of professional experience as a Product Designer, UX Designer, or Front-End Engineer to apply.\\n\\n- A portfolio of relevant design work that you’re proud to share that includes digital products, not just websites\\n- A history of successfully shipping products and collaborating cross-functionally with both software engineers and business stakeholders\\n- The passion and drive to learn about Retrium and our customers\\n- A growth mindset with an openness to feedback, learning, and experimentation\\n- Experience with Agile software development processes, from problem definition through to detailed UI and visual design\\n- Experience designing a B2B SaaS product is strongly preferred\\n- Experience in a distributed team and/or high-growth startup would be helpful \\n\\n#Salary\\n100000 - 140000\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- US-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

    "content": "<p><strong>About Us</strong></p><br /><p>Planes is a young digital product studio, started by two friends who liked making great products together. As we grow that will always be our essence - to work on products we believe in with people we enjoy every day.</p><br /><p>Our background is in startups, not agencies. We prefer shipping code, listening to users and iterating quickly rather than long lunches, &lsquo;expert&rsquo; reports and death by powerpoint. This approach has lead us to work with all sorts of people, from international fin-tech providers to startups, building products that their users love.</p><br /><p>A small and nimble team, we work collaboratively to produce work that we are proud of and our clients love. We are made up of designers, engineers and product lovers who are all entrepreneurs by nature.</p><br /><p><strong>The Role</strong></p><br /><p>We are looking for a Junior Product Manager to join our team full time. You will be responsible for managing a number of products at once, both new projects and retainers for existing products. Working in a multi-disciplinary team you will be the voice of the user, while also keeping sprints running on time and budget. Days will be varied and could involve any of the following:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Running user interviews to uncover insights</li><br /><li>Testing prototypes with users to understand usability and solution fit</li><br /><li>Digging into data to inform decisions and query hypothesis</li><br /><li>Collaborating with a designer to convert ideas into a tangible product</li><br /><li>Writing user stories and managing development pipelines to ensure delivery stays on track</li><br /><li>Running product demos and sprint planning sessions with clients and the development team</li><br /><li>Researching and making recommendations for solutions to product problems, or to help with product goals</li><br /><li>Wireframing and mapping out user journeys</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>About you</strong></p><br /><p>For this role, you will have the right combination of experience and skills to manage multiple projects and priorities. You will need to be able to take the initiative and be organised as the rest of the team will rely on you to keep workflows moving in the right direction. Tonnes of experience is not required, but here is some idea of the kinds of experience that would suit:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Client facing; communicating directly with clients both written and in person</li><br /><li>UX research/design; an appreciation of how users interact with products, how to map and measure these journeys and the ability to improve them. You might have some experience with wireframing too.</li><br /><li>Project planning; aptitude at managing many moving parts and conflicting stakeholders requirements</li><br /><li>Specification writing; translating designs or requirements to user stories for developers to build</li><br /><li>Scrum/agile exposure; you will have exposure to the principles of agile development, and know how to adapt a development framework to suit various types of projects.</li><br /><li>Exposure to deliverying digital projects; this doesn't have to be apps it could be micro sites or campaigns for an agency too for example</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Working at Planes</strong></p><br /><p>We are a relatively relaxed bunch, and believe that if we hire adults and treat them like them we won't need any baby sitters. As such we leave it to you to decide where and when you will do your best work. If you need to stay at home and nut out a tough problem so be it, if you have to come in late because you are dancing at Morning Glory -power too you! That being said, we all tend to spend most of our time in the studio because we have more fun working together, so this is not a fully remote role.</p><br /><p>We are also a social bunch and since we work with people we like we tend to hang out after work too. We don't really plan anything but tend to find ourselves doing at least one activity together a month be it mountain biking, rock climbing or just going out for beers. We also get that you have your own life too, so won't be upset if you can't join us every Friday night.</p><br /><p>Holidays are the spice of life, so on top of your 28 days a year, we also let you take up to a month of leave without pay if you like to do even more adventuring.</p><br /><p><strong>Hiring process</strong></p><br /><p>If this sounds like a piece of you, please send through a short (no longer than one paragraph) intro on you along with your CV. If we like what we see we will start with a phone call. Following that we will send you across a small challenge for you to work on and come in to present back to us, at the same time we will introduce you to the team, show you our office and have a chat over a coffee.</p>",

The incredibly competitive nature of the sports betting industry gave birth to a plethora of betting promotions to entice new and existing customers. These promotions allowed savvy gamblers to take advantage of markets using a risk-free match betting strategy. This business founded to educate this risk-free strategy to the less savvy betting customer as well as people that may have never placed a bet before by creating exceptional video content with clear and precise instructions. They began gaining lots of traction and built their subscriber base organically to highly profitable levels.</p> <p>The bedrock of their business is their own suite of software that identifies betting opportunities for their subscribers. The core of the software is their odds system, which downloads data for hundreds of bookmakers across thousands of events (resulting in millions of rows of data) and maps that data into a central database for other systems to utilise. This data is collected by way of APIs, XML feeds and Python Screen Scraping. The odds system and related tools are .NET applications written in C#.</p> <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p> <p>The software is complex and requires someone to manage it along with a team of 4 developers (Two Python, 1 full stack and 1 C# Developer.) That's where you come in. You will undertake a full audit of all existing tech processes and will assess ways to massively optimise systems and personnel; ensuring that the end product is flawless. This will involve a mixture of hands-on analysis / coding and guiding the team to deliver. You will be responsible for ensuring all software is able to deliver on commercial goals, whilst also ensuring the development of new systems and software to stay ahead of the curve.</p> <p><em>The successful candidate should have a strong blend of the below attributes:</em></p> <ul><li>Exemplary project management and leadership skills</li><li>Familiar with AGILE or other methodologies</li><li>NET (C#)</li><li>MS SQL Server</li><li>Python</li><li>NET Core</li><li>Knowledge of REST and Web APIs</li><li>MS SQL Server (Writing SQL and stored procedures)</li><li>Github</li><li>Windows Services</li><li>Database Expertise</li><li>Some interest or experience in the sports / betting industry would be preferred.</li></ul><p><strong>What will YOU need?</strong></p> <ul><li>Extensive experience of managing teams of developers, preferably in a sports/betting company or an online aggregator focused business.</li><li>Experience managing teams, recruiting talent, optimising software and bringing software to market.</li><li>Genuine excitement at the prospect of driving a major tech overhaul with a lack of red tape.</li></ul><p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p> <ul><li>Competitive Salary: Up to £110,000</li><li>Should you wish to have an office for the tech team or manage it fully remotely will be up to you. There would likely be a couple of team meetings per month if remote. Currently, the team reside in the midlands.</li><li>Senior decision-making tech role in a fast-growing UK business as it continues to educate and smarten consumers in the sports betting industry</li></ul><p>Please apply for a more detaileed conversation about the business.</p></div>",

We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;6m in venture funding from the most respected investors in technology and real estate. Our vision is to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed. The beginning of this journey is our online platform to help businesses rent, manage and share office space in London.</p><br /><p>As a product designer at Hubble, you will have the opportunity to add your magic to every stage of the design process. Working closely with product managers and tech leads, you will have the autonomy to conjure up functional yet delightful solutions to genuine user problems. All the while working towards business goals.</p><br /><p>Your role will of course include wire-framing, prototyping and spinning up high fidelity designs and assets but this is only a small part. Through user testing and internal feedback sessions, you will be responsible for continually testing ideas and assumptions and mixing your findings back into the designs. You will be able to use these findings to explain and defend your design rationale with the wider team and stakeholders. Excellent communication skills, explaining complex solutions in simple terms and the ability to challenge people in the wider team at all levels, backed with evidence, are all crucial.</p><br /><p>Strong visual UI design is a given, but beyond that you will be instrumental in following and helping to build out the Hubble design system. You will work closely with our engineers and regularly pair with them to help set the rules and ingredients for new design assets and components. A keen eye for detail is important but you should understand the trade-offs between striving for pixel-perfection against good enough to ship fast.</p><br /><p>You will possess a functional but creative mind and a no-fear attitude to your work. With a scientific approach to product design, don't be afraid to fail-fast and learn. You will feel empowered to push the needle, and suggest wildcard ideas that may make some colleagues squirm, but always be grounded in the possible. We build our products in an iterative, continuous deployment style, but as a designer you should always be thinking of where we want to be rather than just what's next.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>REQUIREMENTS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years experience in designing digital products.</li><br /><li>Fully proficient in designing for various screen sizes with a mobile first approach to responsive design.</li><br /><li>Solid understanding of UX design principles.</li><br /><li>Good understanding of atomic design and front end architecture.</li><br /><li>Expertise in the tools of the trade, sketch, invision etc. UI animations desirable but not required.</li><br /><li>Have the confidence to explain and defend design decisions to colleagues at all levels.</li><br /><li>Experience in mapping out user journeys and flows.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>&nbsp;</h2><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>BENEFITS</h2><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture.

Cliniko makes life easy for Allied Health professionals by handling appointment scheduling, storing treatment notes, and a bunch of other things. It’s quite a neat system and is used globally by tens of thousands of people every day.</p><p><strong>Things we love to do:</strong></p><ul><li>Provide great software and service.</li><li>Work with talented people.</li><li>Delight our customers.</li><li>Make the world a little bit better.</li></ul><p><strong>How we work</strong></p><p>We work smarter, not harder.&nbsp;<strong>We think work/life balance is important and we work a 30-hour week as standard (you still get full-time pay; it’s a full-time position).</strong></p><p>Even though we’re based out of Melbourne, Australia, our team is spread around the world. We want to hire the best person available, not just the best person within a 10km radius. You can see our team’s locations on the Red Guava website (admittedly that site is a bit neglected, so it’s kind of how our team looked a couple of years ago).</p><p>If you want to know more about how we work (which really is quite different), our founder Joel gave a talk about it.</p><p><strong>The job</strong></p><p>We are looking for a Growth Marketer to join our team. We’d love someone that can be up and running very quickly, but that doesn’t mean you need 5 years’ experience in the industry. What we really care about is skill, passion, and integrity. That’s much more important than what’s on your CV.</p><p><strong>Who you are</strong></p><p>You understand how to reach people and let them know about a product that could be useful for them. You’re able to do so in a helpful friendly way, not a hard sales approach. You’re very familiar with the options for marketing in the digital world. Not only do you stay up to date with the latest trends and technologies available, but you’re also creative with your approach.</p><p>You either have a very strong knowledge of SEM, or at the very least, a keen interest and the aptitude to learn it very quickly.</p><p>You’re passionate about helping people find solutions to their problems, and strive to do so at scale with your work. You much rather sustainable long term growth, than a fleeting quick win.</p><p>You’re prepared to roll up your sleeves and get it done. You don’t need a team to bring your vision to life, you’re very capable with your hands on the tools.</p><p><strong>What you’ll work on</strong></p><p>You will spend your time helping people find out about Cliniko. This includes:</p><ul><li>Improve our measuring and reporting for both growth and churn.</li><li>Public relations.</li><li>Identifying partnership opportunities.</li><li>Investigate and reduce our churn.</li><li>Paid search ads (SEM).</li><li>Improving our on-boarding.</li><li>Helping develop our content strategy (and producing content).</li><li>Optimising for organic search (SEO).</li><li>Anything else you think needs doing.</li></ul><p>There are many businesses that could benefit greatly from using Cliniko, you’ll help them do that.</p><p><strong>Great work environment</strong></p><p>We want people doing their best work with us. We know that needs a great work environment, and we don’t just mean a flashy office. Some things we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:</p><ul><li>30-hour work week.</li><li>Complete autonomy.</li><li><strong>Work from anywhere.</strong></li><li>Unlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year).</li><li>Supplied computer equipment.</li><li>Ergonomic furniture.</li><li>Fresh organic fruit weekly to your home.</li><li><strong>Overseas trips for full team meet-ups (family invited and paid for too).</strong></li><li>No managers.</li><li>No meetings.</li></ul><p><strong>In summary</strong></p><p>Let’s be clear, you do need to be seriously amazing. We don’t hire often and when we do, we get hundreds of applicants. We will offer you the best job you have ever had with plenty of perks, but we expect you to be super-talented.</p><p>You should be absolutely passionate about digital marketing. You should believe you can make a significant difference in our growth and churn rates.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/redguava/b99f552b-d33a-48a2-87f4-3151b126eb14' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

It’s quite a neat system and is used globally by tens of thousands of people every day.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Things we love to do:</div><ul><li>Provide great software and service.</li><li>Work with talented people.</li><li>Delight our customers.</li><li>Make the world a little bit better.</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><span>How we work</span></strong></div><div>We work smarter, not harder. We think work/life balance is important and we work a 30-hour week as standard (you still get a full-time pay; it’s a full-time position).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Even though we’re based out of Melbourne, Australia, our team is spread around the world. We want to hire the best person available, not just the best person within a 10km radius. You can see our team’s locations on the&nbsp;<a href='https://www.redguava.com.au/' rel='nofollow'>Red Guava</a>&nbsp;website (admittedly that site is a bit neglected, so it’s kind of how our team looked a couple of years ago).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If you want to know more about how we work (which really is quite different), our founder Joel gave a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_2jXqzxBNU' rel='nofollow'>talk</a> about it.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><span>The job</span></strong></div><div><span>We are looking for a Growth Marketer to join our team. We’d love someone that can be up and running very quickly, but that doesn’t mean you need 5 years experience in the industry. What we really care about is skill, passion, and integrity. That’s much more important than what’s on your CV.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><span>Who you are</span></strong></div><div><span>You understand how to reach people and let them know about a product that could be useful for them. You’re able to do so in a helpful friendly way, not a hard sales approach. You’re very familiar with the options for marketing in the digital world. Not only do you stay up to date with latest trends and technologies available, you’re also creative with your approach.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span>You either have a very strong knowledge of SEM, or at the very least, a keen interest and the aptitude to learn it very quickly.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You’re passionate about helping people find solutions to their problems, and strive to do so at scale with your work. You much rather sustainable long term growth, than a fleeting quick win.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>You’re prepared to roll up your sleeves and get it done. You don’t need a team to bring your vision to life, you’re very capable with your hands on the tools.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><span>What you’ll work on</span></strong></div><div><span>You will spend your time helping people find out about Cliniko. This includes:</span></div><ul><li><span>Improve our measuring and reporting for both growth and churn.</span></li><li>Public relations.</li><li><span>Identifying partnership opportunities.</span></li><li><span>Investigate and reduce our churn.</span></li><li><span>Paid search ads (SEM).</span></li><li><span>Improving our&nbsp;</span><span>on-boarding.</span></li><li><span>Helping develop our content strategy (and producing content).</span></li><li><span>Optimising for organic search (SEO).</span></li><li><span>Anything else you think needs doing.</span></li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span>There are many businesses that could benefit greatly from using Cliniko, you’ll help them do that.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><span>Great work environment</span></strong></div><div><span>We want people doing their best work with us. We know that needs a great work environment, and we don’t just mean a flashy office. Some things we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:</span></div><ul><li><span>30-hour work week.</span></li><li><span>Complete autonomy.</span></li><li><span>Work from anywhere.</span></li><li><span>Unlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year).</span></li><li><span>Supplied computer equipment.</span></li><li><span>Ergonomic furniture.</span></li><li><span>Fresh organic fruit weekly to your home.</span></li><li><span>Overseas trips for full team meet-ups (family invited and paid for too).</span></li><li><span>No managers.</span></li><li><span>No meetings.</span></li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong><span>In summary</span></strong></div><div><span>Let’s be clear, you do need to be seriously amazing. We don’t hire often and when we do, we get hundreds of applicants. We will offer you the best job you have ever had with plenty of perks, but we expect you to be super-talented.</span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span>You should be absolutely passionate about digital marketing. You should believe you can make a significant difference in our growth and churn rates.</span></div></div><p></p><div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><span><u>Job applications close 16th of October, 2019.</u></span></div></div><p></p>  </div>",

Our team works remotely from all over the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Our sole focus is building an application called <a href='https://www.cliniko.com/' rel='nofollow'>Cliniko</a>. Cliniko makes life easy for Allied Health professionals by handling appointment scheduling, storing treatment notes, and a bunch of other things. It's quite a neat system and is used globally by tens of thousands of people every day.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Things we love to do:</strong></div><ul><li>Provide great software and service.</li><li>Work with talented people.</li><li>Delight our customers.</li><li>Make the world a little bit better.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>How we work<br></strong>We work smarter, not harder. We think work/life balance is important and we work a 30-hour week as standard (you still get a full-time pay; it’s a full-time position).<br><br></div><div>Even though we're based out of Melbourne, Australia, our team is spread around the world. We want to hire the best person available, not just the best person within a 10km radius. You can see our team's locations on the <a href='http://www.redguava.com.au/' rel='nofollow'>Red Guava</a> website (admittedly that site is a bit neglected, so it's kind of how our team looked a couple of years ago).</div><div><br></div><div>If you want to know more about how we work (which really is quite different), our founder Joel gave a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_2jXqzxBNU' rel='nofollow'>talk</a> about it.</div><h3>The Job</h3><div>We are looking for a Growth Marketer to join our team. We'd love someone that can be up and running very quickly, but that doesn't mean you need 5 years experience in the industry. What we really care about is skill, passion, and integrity. That's much more important than what’s on your CV.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Who you are</strong></div><div>You understand how to reach people and let them know about a product that could be useful for them. You're able to do so in a helpful friendly way, not a hard sales approach. You're very familiar with the options for marketing in the digital world. Not only do you stay up to date with latest trends and technologies available, you're also creative with your approach.</div><div><br></div><div>You either have a very strong knowledge of SEM, or at the very least, a keen interest and the aptitude to learn it very quickly.</div><div><br></div><div>You're passionate about helping people find solutions to their problems, and strive to do so at scale with your work. You much rather sustainable long term growth, than a fleeting quick win.</div><div><br></div><div>You're prepared to roll up your sleeves and get it done. You don't need a team to bring your vision to life, you're very capable with your hands on the tools.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What you'll work on<br></strong>You will spend your time helping people find out about Cliniko. This includes:</div><ul><li>Improve our measuring and reporting for both growth and churn.</li><li>Public relations.</li><li>Identifying partnership opportunities.</li><li>Investigate and reduce our churn.</li><li>Paid search ads (SEM).</li><li>Improving our on-boarding.</li><li>Helping develop our content strategy (and producing content).</li><li>Optimising for organic search (SEO).</li><li>Anything else you think needs doing.</li></ul><div>There are many businesses that could benefit greatly from using Cliniko, you'll help them do that.</div><div><br><strong>Great work environment</strong></div><div>We want people doing their best work with us. We know that needs a great work environment, and we don't just mean a flashy office. Some things we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:</div><ul><li>30-hour work week.</li><li>Complete autonomy.</li><li>Work from anywhere.</li><li>Unlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year).</li><li>Supplied computer equipment.</li><li>Ergonomic furniture.</li><li>Fresh organic fruit weekly to your home.</li><li>Overseas trips for full team meet-ups (family invited and paid for too).</li><li>No managers.</li><li>No meetings.</li></ul><div><br><strong>In summary</strong></div><div>Let’s be clear, you do need to be seriously amazing. We don't hire often and when we do, we get hundreds of applicants. We will offer you the best job you have ever had with plenty of perks, but we expect you to be super-talented.</div><div><br></div><div>You should be absolutely passionate about digital marketing. You should believe you can make a significant difference in our growth and churn rates.<br><br><br><br></div><div><strong>Job applications close 16th of October, 2019.</strong></div></div>",

Communicating to the world is at the heart of delivering that.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a growing startup so we&rsquo;re looking for a well rounded Marketing graduate capable of growing with us from the ground up.</p><br /><h2>About Desana</h2><br /><p>Desana gives our customers access to a network of great work space when they want it, where they want it, through a single monthly subscription. We do that by supporting coworking spaces, taking their spare inventory and giving our customers fluid access to it.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a growing startup based between London, Edinburgh, and Stockholm but we aim to become a globally relevant company by disrupting the way people think about, and access, the places they work. We're looking for the best people to join us on our journey.</p><br /><p>With prior experience in startups ourselves, we&rsquo;re keen to do things the right way from the very start. That&rsquo;s why we believe in openness and transparency in everything we do, from salary to communications, to processes.</p><br /><h2>Why Join Us?</h2><br /><p>We&rsquo;re at the forefront of a new wave of innovation in the office space sector which is already undergoing tremendous change and significant growth. Join us to not only grow our brand which is changing the ways people work, but by living and breathing the innovation as you work flexibly, autonomously, and (as much as the job demands) remotely yourself. We pride ourselves in radical open-ness and strive to create a company that fulfils its users, partners, and employees.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2>The Role</h2><br /><p>Marketing done well isn&rsquo;t always marketing done by the book. It&rsquo;s out-of-the-box, inherently unique thinking that makes the biggest impact.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re giving you the chance to flex your creativity. We want to build a brand that&rsquo;s memorable and impactful to both our customers and the workspaces that we&rsquo;re partnered with. To do that, we need someone that&rsquo;s motivated to:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Work with the founders and get to know the business really well.</li><br /><li>Work with our consumer groups, and workspace partners and will learn how to speak with them directly through email and LinkedIn, and indirectly through our social media channels.</li><br /><li>Work as a member of the team to produce a marketing strategy plan - you&rsquo;ll be in charge of delivering it.</li><br /><li>Work together to generate creative ideas and to identify new, high impact ways (and channels) to grow the business and engage potential customers.</li><br /><li>Run our social media platforms.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Work with photographers and videographers to create high-quality, engaging media.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Create and manage a content calendar for analytically focussed, multi-channel marketing campaigns.</li><br /><li>Reach out directly to potential customers and create a pipeline for the team to meet with them.</li><br /><li>Participate daily in a 10 minute whole team &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; call, wherever you are. Our team are regularly in London so it will be up to you to touch-base with us and take charge of your days.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>About You</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>You have a solid understanding of marketing: you have a relevant degree and, ideally, can already demonstrate experience in delivering marketing campaigns.</li><br /><li>You know what&rsquo;s effective: you have experience with marketing automation platforms, CDPs, and attribution tools and it would be advantageous if you are able to make good recommendations on different platforms.</li><br /><li>You get the importance of data: you understand growth metrics, A/B testing, and statistics and you&rsquo;ve delivered effective data-driven strategies and marketing campaigns across multiple media channels for for the companies you&rsquo;ve worked with.</li><br /><li>You can design: not essential for the role but it would be extremely advantageous if you have design experience that can be applied directly to content creation.</li><br /><li>You have CRM experience / awareness: not essential but would be really useful.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re personable: a fun, enthusiastic people-person.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re self-starting &amp; self-motivated: you&rsquo;re confident in your abilities, willing to take on responsibilities, and manage your own agendas and work scopes. Actively seek and respond to feedback.</li><br /><li>You can communicate diligently: you&rsquo;re able to understand the importance of maintaining regular communication with our team, our partners, affiliates, and our customers. You have excellent written and verbal communication skills in English.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re never complacent: you strive to recognise that things can always be better than they currently are and have the confidence to present solutions to any weaknesses or inefficiencies that you see.</li><br /><li>You have a growth mindset: a desire to grow both personally and professionally.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Desana benefits</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Share options in the business if the role were to become full time.</li><br /><li>Flexible and remote work hours with a strong focus on work-life balance.</li><br /><li>We&rsquo;re establishing complete salary transparency across the company with clear progression paths.</li><br /><li>Team drinks, events and trips.</li><br /><li>Free access to the app and our network of workspaces.</li><br /></ul>",

You’ll be a product expert: filling the gaps between what features we have, what customers are aware of, and use cases for growth.</li><li><strong>Create messaging that communicates value. </strong>Great stories enable us to differentiate from competitors, communicate the value of our products, and share our impact with the world. You’ll use market, customer, and competitive research to create effective messaging frameworks, content, collateral, and sales tools to drive adoption and growth.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Design, develop, and execute cross-functional product launches.</strong> You’ll be the point person for product launches, and are responsible for knowing what we’re releasing; who it will benefit; how impactful it will be; and how to best get the word out. That includes creating audience segmentation plans; developing messaging around the value of the new feature; writing copy and content along the customer journey for our self-service and sales-assisted funnels; pulling together the launch plan; coordinating marketing activities; identifying opportunities for iteration and experimentation; and measuring the impact of your campaigns.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Support demand generation, content marketing, and acquisition efforts. </strong>From crafting website copy to running a custom video shoot and everything in between, you’ll collaborate with internal teams, freelancers, and agencies to create and maintain an up-to-date product presence across all marketing channels. This will include (but is not limited to) our website, email programs, blog, print materials, digital assets, events, and more. Everything you write sets and reinforces the voice and tone of our brand.</li><li><strong>Enable our customer-facing teams.</strong> You’ll educate our internal customer-facing teams to ensure they’re informed of what we’re releasing, how it will benefit our customers, and how to talk about it. You’ll participate in gathering competitive intelligence; ensuring consistency of our messaging across teams and channels; and producing internal and external product materials including case studies, sales collateral, and internal training sessions.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><strong><br>About You<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>You’ll need to be skilled in understanding, articulating, and communicating the value of our products to our target audience through creative marketing tactics and programs.&nbsp;</li><li>You have superhuman organizational skills, an entrepreneurial spirit, and the capability to bring different teams together to achieve a common goal. You have a track record of getting things done—managing multiple projects and timelines simultaneously.</li><li>You are empathetic and thoughtful, always putting yourself in the customer’s shoes. You know that the most relevant messages start with understanding how people feel, which includes internal and external partners and stakeholders.&nbsp;</li><li>You have a high bar of excellence and leave no stone unturned when it comes to the details. Shipping a campaign with a broken link will temporarily ruin your day (but you’ll quickly recover and learn from the mistake, as will we!).</li><li>You are an outstanding writer, with a knack for summing up a customer benefit in 10 words or less. You can connect <strong>what</strong> something does with <strong>why</strong> the reader should care in a clear, articulate way.</li><li>You have a thorough, practical understanding of the product marketing process and understand how to balance competing demands and needs while always delivering content and communications that are valuable for your customers.</li><li>You are excited about being part of a remote-first company! No experience is required—we’re happy to set you up for success.</li><li>You have worked in B2B SaaS and enjoy the challenges of attracting people and getting them to consider our product.

    "content": "<h1><strong>About us</strong></h1><br /><p>We are on a journey to make pet healthcare more accessible, and we want you to help us! Did you know that only 8% of health issues are seen by a veterinary professional? In real numbers: pets experience 24 issues per year, but only 2 of them make it to the vet. This isn&rsquo;t because people are bad at being pet owners &mdash; going to the vet can be expensive, and takes a lot of effort, and sometimes it&rsquo;s even embarrassing. We want to remove all these barriers that stop pet parents from seeking expert care so that our pets can live the long and healthy lives they deserve.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our mission is to empower vets to advocate for their patients wherever and whenever suits them. Our current product provides an app-based approach that allows vets to interact with their patients through a combination of chat and video consultations. The future holds lots of exciting opportunities to expand this into the go-to app for all things pet care related. Gula recently raised a pre-seed round of funding, and off the back of that, we are looking to build the beginnings of our product team, which is where you come in. With a goal like allowing pets to live healthier lives, a fantastic experience across all our user facing products is going to be key to overcoming challenges in changing the way pet owners think about how they interact with their care providers.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our customer facing products right now are in the form of iOS &amp; Android apps written in React Native, with a web-app soon to follow. We envisage most pet owners interacting with their vets through digital means via their mobile devices. To date, most UX work has been done in Sketch, but we are open to any tooling that can do the job well!</p><br /><h1><strong>Who we&rsquo;re looking for</strong></h1><br /><p>You would be the first Product Designer working at Gula, which gives you the opportunity to help architect the ways of working in the product team and put in place what we would consider to be best practices. Your primary responsibility will be to deliver fantastic user experiences across our range of user-facing products, both to pet owners and vets. Here are some projects you might work on in the next six months:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Building the base of a design system for Gula.</li><br /><li>Designing innovative ways for pet owners to communicate with their vet.</li><br /><li>Redesigning our website to speak to our target customers better.</li><br /><li>Crafting the language we use to speak to our users.</li><br /><li>Testing new propositions with our users.</li><br /><li>Building a library of assets to be used in marketing material.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>You might be perfect for this role if most of these apply to you:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have extensive experience designing for iOS and Android</li><br /><li>You have extensive experience designing for the responsive web</li><br /><li>You consider a close relationship with the engineering team mandatory for building great products</li><br /><li>You have worked in a start-up</li><br /><li>You have experience with user research</li><br /><li>You have experience with user testing</li><br /><li>You would describe yourself as an animal lover</li><br /><li>You are happy working autonomously</li><br /><li>You love learning new things</li><br /></ul><br /><h1><strong>Application process</strong></h1><br /><p>Once we have reviewed your CV and have decided that we could be a great mutual match, we&rsquo;d start with a short phone call or coffee to tell you more about what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve at Gula long-term and also to give you some more details about the role. Then if successful there would be a final stage where we&rsquo;d spend some more time talking about your design thinking, look at some problems together, and you would meet Gula&rsquo;s CEO Thom to find out more about our values and to see if you&rsquo;d fit in.</p><br /><h1><strong>The benefits</strong></h1><br /><ul><br /><li>Pay &pound;55,000-65,000</li><br /><li>Stock options</li><br /><li>Flexible hours</li><br /><li>Working from home when you want</li><br /><li>25 days holiday</li><br /><li>Pick your own hardware up to &pound;2000</li><br /><li>Training budget</li><br /><li>Central London office</li><br /></ul>",

You will be responsible for content development, publishing, and community management on each of these social networks, as well as others you see as critical to our social strategy. You will need a deep understanding of each platform and how it can be leveraged to connect to teachers</p><p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Manage day-to-day messaging, monitoring and moderation across social channels: Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, and Twitter, among others</li><li>Write warm, funny, engaging content for social media channels daily</li><li>Create and manage our social media editorial calendar</li><li>Identify and engage with influential educators.</li><li>Provide support to our customers via social media channels</li><li>Turn frequently asked questions into clearly written help articles and video tutorials</li></ul><p><strong>Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Exceptional short-form writing skill</li><li>Short, snappy, and funny writing style</li><li>Fun and friendly sense of humor</li><li>2+ years of social media experience</li><li>Demonstrated ability to create / edit images for the internet</li><li><strong>4 year college degree with a major that involves a lot of writing (English, journalism, etc.)</strong></li><li>Strong sense of ownership and urgency</li><li>Strong organizational and project management skills</li></ul><p><strong>Nice to Have:</strong></p><ul><li>You were in the drama club or do improv and/or stand-up comedy for fun </li><li>You have worked for a very early stage technology startup.</li></ul><p><strong>More about the job:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Remote – We work remotely</strong>.

Your role will be to build and maintain great relationships with a network of work spaces.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re therefore looking for an energetic people-person to help us build a strong network of workspaces that our customers can access through the Desana app.</p><br /><h2>People</h2><br /><p>Desana gives people access to a network of great work space when they want it, where they want it, through a single monthly subscription.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a growing startup based between London, Edinburgh, and Stockholm. We aim to become a globally relevant company by disrupting the way people think about, and access, the places they work. We're looking for the best people to join us on our journey.</p><br /><p>With prior experience in startups ourselves, we&rsquo;re keen to do things the right way from the very start. That&rsquo;s why we believe in openness and transparency in everything we do, from salary to communications, to processes.</p><br /><h2>Why Join Us</h2><br /><p>We&rsquo;re at the forefront of a new wave of innovation in the office space sector which is already undergoing tremendous change and significant growth. Join us to not only grow the network of workspaces that are already changing the ways people work, but by living and breathing that transformation as you work flexibly, autonomously, and (as much as the job demands) remotely yourself. We pride ourselves in radical open-ness and strive to create a company that fulfils its users, partners, and employees.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2>The Role</h2><br /><h2><em>Growing the Network</em></h2><br /><p>We want to build a network that&rsquo;s genuinely valuable to our customers and the operators that we work with. To do that, we need someone that&rsquo;s motivated to: &nbsp;</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Increase the number of workspaces on the Desana platform each month across the UK.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Collaborate in the shaping and delivery of a scalable space onboarding and retention&nbsp; strategies - regular communication with workspaces on the network; in person, LinkedIn, by phone, by email, and through events.</li><br /><li>Maintain CRM to track relationships and opportunities.</li><br /><li>Create and deliver result orientated &ldquo;sprints&rdquo; (tasks) based on the company&rsquo;s 6 and 12 month goals.&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><h2><em>Communication</em></h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Working directly with team to incessantly improve brand and workspace onboarding experience / interaction.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Regular monitoring and updating of our task management system.</li><br /><li>Prepare weekly, monthly, quarterly meetings that effectively communicate data informed outcomes from onboarding strategies.</li><br /><li>Participate daily in a 10 minute whole team &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; call, wherever you are.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2><em>Industry Awareness</em></h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Consistently develop wider awareness of coworking industry trends; meticulous attention to specific triggers for workspace / operator types.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Be able to identify and respond to micro-indicators of change.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2><em>About You</em></h2><br /><ul><br /><li>You have hospitality or related experience: If you&rsquo;ve worked in the coworking / flexible workspace industry or in a workspace brokering environment that would be advantageous (2-3 years preferably, but not critical to apply).&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have experience in sales: it would be great if you can bring experience in managing operational tasks in a sales/relationship management role.</li><br /><li>You can stay cool and deliver effectively: you have the ability to work to a deadline, prioritising workloads according to different criteria.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re data-driven: you understand growth metrics, A/B testing, and statistics and will use these skills to devise effective on-boarding strategies.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have CRM experience / awareness: particularly Hubspot. Not essential but would be really useful.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re personable: a fun, enthusiastic people-person. Ready to jump on the phone for a chat when appropriate.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re self-starting &amp; self-motivated: you&rsquo;re confident in your abilities, willing to take initiative, to take on your own responsibilities, and manage your own agendas and work scopes. Actively seek and respond to feedback.</li><br /><li>You can communicate diligently: you&rsquo;re able to understand the importance of maintaining regular communication with our team, our partners, and the workspace operators in our network. Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re never complacent: you strive to recognise that things can always be better than they currently are and have the confidence to present solutions to any weaknesses or inefficiencies that you see.</li><br /><li>You have a growth mindset: a desire to grow both personally and professionally.</li><br /><li>You have grit: the resilience and desire to work in a startup. You know when to seize the right opportunities in a fast-paced environment, while working to exceed the expectations of all market segments.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have a good network: if you have a good contact base in the UK coworking / property sector, that would be extremely useful but not essential.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Desana Benefits</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Share options in the business.</li><br /><li>Flexible and remote work hours with a strong focus on work-life balance.</li><br /><li>We&rsquo;re establishing complete salary transparency across the company with clear progression paths.</li><br /><li>Team drinks, events, and trips.</li><br /><li>Free access to the app and our network of workspaces.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Think you&rsquo;re the right person for the role?

    "content": "<h3> Humbly Confident Product Designer </h3><div><div>YNAB is growing, and so is our product design team. We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal finance apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have experience in designing great interfaces and experiences for most of those platforms. More important, you’re a designer who views your job as that of problem solver. You come to the table not only with a knack for interaction design and love of logical UI patterns, but also with a deep empathy for people. We design our software to fit our users more than our fancy, and you love nothing more than digging through (or conducting!) research that leads the way in the design process. You’ve been around the block a few times and know what it means to design a mature, evolving product.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):&nbsp;</strong></div><ul><li>You must have at least 3 years of experience working in product design <strong>at a software company.</strong> Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.</li><li>Experience in designing applications for both web and mobile (in your cover letter, please include the platforms for which you have designed and your level of experience with them).&nbsp;</li><li>We are looking for a designer who has a strong background in UX and usability but who also can design UI independently. This is a truly mixed position where you will be responsible for activities traditionally held in the “UX” and “UI” wheelhouses. And a user-testing/research wheelhouse, too. (Can you have three wheelhouses? Are they still wheelhouses? Yes, sometimes we do philosophical tangents, too.)</li></ul><div>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></h3><div>We build YNAB (or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands), the best budgeting software around. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.<br><br><br></div><div>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> Cultural Manifesto</a> has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong><br>Who you’d be working with:<br></strong><br><br></div><div><strong>Todd, </strong>our Chief Product Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—and knows that begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence <strong>and </strong>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.<br><br><br></div><div>And our product designers:<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Alan</strong> can be seen wearing many hats—and loving every second of it. He could be interviewing users one day and programming a prototype in Framer the next. He loves exploring ideas with teammates and lives for that rush when the team discovers a novel solution to a difficult problem. When he’s not busy designing, he’s probably either at Crossfit or working to improve his culinary skills... or contemplating the conflicts that occasionally arise between the two.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Andrea </strong>has spent a lengthy career knee-deep in interactive design. Today she finds great satisfaction in her dream job at YNAB where design and helping others converge—the perfect environment for empathic-driven design. After work, this compulsive doodler cherishes her time with her husband and kids. Soaking up live music, art, and setting sail on the occasional cruise are among her favorite to-dos.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Cindy </strong>sweats the small details when it comes to crafting simple, intuitive experiences. She loves having conversations with our users, and digs deep to find the root of their needs before exploring a solution. On most weekends (and some weekdays, depending on the daylight saving time), you can probably find her outdoors chasing sunrise and sunset with a camera in hand.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Dylan </strong>loves organizing design systems, obsessing over typographic details, and everything in between. Above his desk (ahem, kitchen table, it's a small apartment after all) sits an inconspicuous letterpressed card with Dieter Rams' 10 principles of good design on it. In his spare time he's probably taking photos or running—sometimes at the same time.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Emily</strong> is a design generalist, through and through. What she loves most about being a designer—besides the obvious draw of working with a team to build things people love—is how much there is to learn. Right now she's focused on honing her coding skills enough to be able to put up the occasional pull request as well as practicing the art of writing great microcopy. She enjoys reading books, cooking, biking, lifting weights, and spending time outdoors.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Kathryn</strong> loves to dig into problems and learn where things aren’t working, what people need, and how we can empower them to be even more amazing.&nbsp; And once she truly understands a problem, figuring out how to solve it is pretty fun. When she’s not at work, she can usually be found reading, conquering escape rooms, or hanging out with her family.<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></h3><div>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. In fact, we were recently recognized as <a href='https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune's #2 best small company to work for</a> in the United States! We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</div><div><strong><br>Live Where You Want<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too.&nbsp; Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</div><div><strong><br>No Crazy Hours<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</div><div><strong><br>Take Vacation (Seriously)<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our Slack channel, creatively named #office_wall</div><div><strong><br>The YNAB Meetup<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'> Costa Rica</a>, a <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and we most recently took over an entire hotel in Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</div><div><strong><br>Up Your Game<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>International is Absolutely Okay<br></strong><br><br></div><div>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</div><div><strong><br>If You’re Stateside…<br></strong><br><br></div><div>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)<br><br><br></div><div>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em><em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)<br><br><br></div><div><strong><br>Other Tidbits</strong></div><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp;</li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not <em>think</em> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.<br><br><br></div><h3>Now, back to you, our new Product Designer...</h3><div><strong>What Success Looks Like: <br></strong><br><br></div><div>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life changing financial control. No small thing, right? You’ll join our six product designers, working on both our web and mobile platforms. Throughout 2020, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB <em>effortless </em>and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience. You will also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users.<br><br><br></div><div>You’ll need to:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Understand the journey our users take, not just as they use our apps, but in the real world as they seek to take control of their financial lives.</li><li>Learn the design system, UI patterns, and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You have no problem designing a cross-platform feature for the web and mobile apps. You can clearly discern and navigate the relationship between the UI and the available data behind the scenes.&nbsp;</li><li>Solve design problems in a user-centric feedback loop. Research plays a big part in our design process so you’ll need to break down analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions. You’ll also follow up on the data gathered after the feature is released and continue to iterate and improve your designs until the data confirms success.&nbsp;</li><li>Shepherd your work from ideation to release. You will document your work for review with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders, make agreed-upon refinements, and will work with the developers on the upcoming feature. Design reviews during the development process examine form and function and you will see the feature through to the end.&nbsp;</li><li>Be comfortable iterating with low-fidelity designs and prototypes while working in cross-functional teams made up of developers, marketers, and customer-facing team members (waterfalls are for rivers!), while continuing to pursue a meticulous and thorough design.</li><li>Communicate and document the styling, user flows, and the impact of your designs on other parts of the system. You’ll update this documentation as feedback comes in and the apps evolve. On the flip side, you’ll provide feedback in design reviews that is clear and helpful in moving our products forward.</li><li>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done <em>in writing. </em>Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</li><li>Be comfortable writing a first pass at UI copy which is then refined with the help of your team in design reviews. There’s no lorem ipsum here.&nbsp;</li><li>You are comfortable speaking the language of software development. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!) to help implement your design work, that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement.</li><li>We use Figma for the vast majority of design work and maintaining our design system. You will aid in the expansion and maintenance of the design system and feel comfortable contributing new UI for our applications and website. If you have experience developing and maintaining design systems and can help us strike a balance between fighting for consistency and pushing the design system forward, that’s another plus.</li><li>Be comfortable talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing. You have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way to share with teammates.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem solving for both user and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions.

We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal finance apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have experience in designing great interfaces and experiences for most of those platforms. More important, you’re a designer who views your job as that of problem solver. You come to the table not only with a knack for interaction design and love of logical UI patterns, but also with a deep empathy for people. We design our software to fit our users more than our fancy, and you love nothing more than digging through (or conducting!) research that leads the way in the design process. You’ve been around the block a few times and know what it means to design a mature, evolving product.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>You must have at least 3 years of experience working in product design&nbsp;</span><span>at a software company.</span><span>&nbsp;Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.</span></li><li><span>Experience in designing applications for both web and mobile (in your cover letter, please include the platforms for which you have designed and your level of experience with them).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>We are looking for a designer who has a strong background in UX and usability but who also can design UI independently. This is a truly mixed position where you will be responsible for activities traditionally held in the “UX” and “UI” wheelhouses. And a user-testing/research wheelhouse, too. (Can you have three wheelhouses? Are they still wheelhouses? Yes, sometimes we do philosophical tangents, too.)</span></li></ul><p><span>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>A Bit About Us</span></h3><p><span>We build YNAB (or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands), the best budgeting software around. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a><span>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></p><p><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;<span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span>&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;</span><em>click</em><span>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Who you’d be working with:</span></h4><p><span>Todd,&nbsp;</span><span>our Chief Product Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—and knows that begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</span></p><p><span>And our product designers:</span></p><p><span>Alan</span><span>&nbsp;can be seen wearing many hats—and loving every second of it. He could be interviewing users one day and programming a prototype in Framer the next. He loves exploring ideas with teammates and lives for that rush when the team discovers a novel solution to a difficult problem. When he’s not busy designing, he’s probably either at Crossfit or working to improve his culinary skills… or contemplating the conflicts that occasionally arise between the two.</span></p><p><span>Andrea&nbsp;</span><span>has spent a lengthy career knee-deep in interactive design. Today she finds great satisfaction in her dream job at YNAB where design and helping others converge—the perfect environment for empathic-driven design. After work, this compulsive doodler cherishes her time with her husband and kids. Soaking up live music, art, and setting sail on the occasional cruise are among her favorite to-dos.</span></p><p><span>Cindy&nbsp;</span><span>sweats the small details when it comes to crafting simple, intuitive experiences. She loves having conversations with our users, and digs deep to find the root of their needs before exploring a solution. On most weekends (and some weekdays, depending on the daylight saving time), you can probably find her outdoors chasing sunrise and sunset with a camera in hand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Dylan&nbsp;</span><span>l</span><span>oves organizing design systems, obsessing over typographic details, and everything in between. Above his desk (ahem, kitchen table, it’s a small apartment after all) sits an inconspicuous letterpressed card with Dieter Rams’ 10 principles of good design on it. In his spare time he’s probably taking photos or running—sometimes at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Emily</span><span>&nbsp;is a design generalist, through and through. What she loves most about being a designer—besides the obvious draw of working with a team to build things people love—is how much there is to learn. Right now she’s focused on honing her coding skills enough to be able to put up the occasional pull request as well as practicing the art of writing great microcopy. She enjoys reading books, cooking, biking, lifting weights, and spending time outdoors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kathryn</span><span>&nbsp;loves to dig into problems and learn where things aren’t working, what people need, and how we can empower them to be even more amazing.&nbsp; And once she truly understands a problem, figuring out how to solve it is pretty fun. When she’s not at work, she can usually be found reading, conquering escape rooms, or hanging out with her family.</span></p><h3><span>How You’ll Work at YNAB</span></h3><p><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. In fact, we were recently recognized as</span>&nbsp;<a href='https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune’s #2 best small company to work for</a><span>&nbsp;in the United States!</span>&nbsp;<span>We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></p><h5><span>Live Where You Want</span></h5><p><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too.&nbsp; Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></p><h5><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h5><p><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></p><h5><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h5><p><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;</span><em>minimum</em><span>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our Slack channel, creatively named #office_wall.</span></p><h5><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></h5><p><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;Costa Rica</a><span>, a&nbsp;</span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a><span>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and we most recently took over an entire hotel in Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></p><h5><span>Up Your Game</span></h5><p><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h5><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></h5><p><span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</span></p><h5><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h5><p><span>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;</span><em>and your family.</em><span>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</span></p><p><span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;</span><em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)</span></p><h5><span>Other Tidbits</span></h5><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas.</span></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;</span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not&nbsp;</span><em>think</em><span>&nbsp;that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span></li></ul><p><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</span></p><h3><span>Now, back to you, our new Product Designer…</span></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>What Success Looks Like:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life changing financial control. No small thing, right? You’ll join our six product designers, working on both our web and mobile platforms. Throughout 2020, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB&nbsp;</span><em>effortless&nbsp;</em><span>and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience. You will also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users.</span></p><p><span>You’ll need to:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>Understand the journey our users take, not just as they use our apps, but in the real world as they seek to take control of their financial lives.</span></li><li><span>Learn the design system, UI patterns, and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You have no problem designing a cross-platform feature for the web and mobile apps. You can clearly discern and navigate the relationship between the UI and the available data behind the scenes.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Solve design problems in a user-centric feedback loop. Research plays a big part in our design process so you’ll need to break down analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions. You’ll also follow up on the data gathered after the feature is released and continue to iterate and improve your designs until the data confirms success.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Shepherd your work from ideation to release. You will document your work for review with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders, make agreed-upon refinements, and will work with the developers on the upcoming feature. Design reviews during the development process examine form and function and you will see the feature through to the end.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable iterating with low-fidelity designs and prototypes while working in cross-functional teams made up of developers, marketers, and customer-facing team members (waterfalls are for rivers!), while continuing to pursue a meticulous and thorough design.</span></li><li><span>Communicate and document the styling, user flows, and the impact of your designs on other parts of the system. You’ll update this documentation as feedback comes in and the apps evolve. On the flip side, you’ll provide feedback in design reviews that is clear and helpful in moving our products forward.</span></li><li><span>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done&nbsp;</span><em>in writing.&nbsp;</em><span>Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable writing a first pass at UI copy which is then refined with the help of your team in design reviews. There’s no lorem ipsum here.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>You are comfortable speaking the language of software development. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!) to help implement your design work, that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement.</span></li><li><span>We use Figma for the vast majority of design work and maintaining our design system. You will aid in the expansion and maintenance of the design system and feel comfortable contributing new UI for our applications and website. If you have experience developing and maintaining design systems and can help us strike a balance between fighting for consistency and pushing the design system forward, that’s another plus.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing. You have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way to share with teammates.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem solving for both user and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our product: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</span></p><p><span>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</span></p><h3><span>How to Apply</span></h3><ul><li><span>Apply through the link below (or here:&nbsp;<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk03p1u' rel='nofollow'>https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk03p1u)</a>&nbsp;by 11:59PM on Oct 3rd, 2019</span><span>.</span>&nbsp;<span>Firm.

    "content": "<section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>DESCRIPTION</h2><br /><p>Hubble is one of the UK&rsquo;s leading PropTech scaleups and we&rsquo;re changing the face of commercial property. We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;6m in venture funding from the most respected investors in technology and real estate. Our vision is to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed. The beginning of this journey is our online platform to help businesses rent, manage and share office space in London.</p><br /><p>As a product designer at Hubble, you will have the opportunity to add your magic to every stage of the design process. Working closely with product managers and tech leads, you will have the autonomy to conjure up functional yet delightful solutions to genuine user problems. All the while working towards business goals.</p><br /><p>Your role will of course include wire-framing, prototyping and spinning up high fidelity designs and assets but this is only a small part. Through user testing and internal feedback sessions, you will be responsible for continually testing ideas and assumptions and mixing your findings back into the designs. You will be able to use these findings to explain and defend your design rationale with the wider team and stakeholders. Excellent communication skills, explaining complex solutions in simple terms and the ability to challenge people in the wider team at all levels, backed with evidence, are all crucial.</p><br /><p>Strong visual UI design is a given, but beyond that you will be instrumental in following and helping to build out the Hubble design system. You will work closely with our engineers and regularly pair with them to help set the rules and ingredients for new design assets and components. A keen eye for detail is important but you should understand the trade-offs between striving for pixel-perfection against good enough to ship fast.</p><br /><p>You will possess a functional but creative mind and a no-fear attitude to your work. With a scientific approach to product design, don't be afraid to fail-fast and learn. You will feel empowered to push the needle, and suggest wildcard ideas that may make some colleagues squirm, but always be grounded in the possible. We build our products in an iterative, continuous deployment style, but as a designer you should always be thinking of where we want to be rather than just what's next.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>REQUIREMENTS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years experience in designing digital products.</li><br /><li>Fully proficient in designing for various screen sizes with a mobile first approach to responsive design.</li><br /><li>Solid understanding of UX design principles.</li><br /><li>Good understanding of atomic design and front end architecture.</li><br /><li>Expertise in the tools of the trade, sketch, invision etc. UI animations desirable but not required.</li><br /><li>Have the confidence to explain and defend design decisions to colleagues at all levels.</li><br /><li>Experience in mapping out user journeys and flows.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>&nbsp;</h2><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>BENEFITS</h2><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture.

    "content": "<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><br /><p>Hubble is one of the UK&rsquo;s leading PropTech scaleups and we&rsquo;re changing the face of commercial property. We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;6m in venture funding from the most respected investors in technology and real estate. Our vision is to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed. The beginning of this journey is our online platform to help businesses rent, manage and share office space in London.</p><br /><p>As a Product Manager you will play a significant role in delivering our vision. You will have full autonomy of a cross-functional squad and will concoct a viable roadmap that mixes customer requirements (often poorly stated or not clearly known by customers themselves) with our vision, sales team feedback, product data and engineering team capabilities in order to build impactful products.</p><br /><p>Though your roadmap is never set in stone. You need to be comfortable in an experimental environment of flux and speed. You adapt to fluid circumstances as new information is learned and priorities change. And in this state of flux you are key to figuring out what not to build, bringing focus and steadiness to teams.</p><br /><p>To do all this, we believe that a great Product Manager is a clarifier, not a confuser. You need to be able to take complexity and distil out what really matters. You are clear-headed and comfortable making decisions on how to do less, not more. To you, less means cutting scope and not quality; constantly trying to find creative (and sometimes risky) solutions to seemingly unfathomable problems. Particularly in situations where data is lacking you must rely on qualitative user research in order to make this call, always with the end goal in mind.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, host monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years product related experience within a tech startup environment.</li><br /><li>Be comfortable managing stakeholders and distilling differing voices within a company.</li><br /><li>Have built a product roadmap that balances customer problems with business goals.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>Proficient with data; understanding what to measure and how.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture. Want to know more about why Hubble is a great place to work? Check out this<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fhubblehq.com%2Fblog%2Fhubble-best-places-to-work' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>&nbsp;recent blog post</a>.</p><br /><p>Hubble is an equal opportunities employer.

The platform spans functional areas such as professional networking, client relationship management, project scoping and management, and billing.

The incredibly competitive nature of the sports betting industry gave birth to a plethora of betting promotions to entice new and existing customers. These promotions allowed savvy gamblers to take advantage of markets using a risk-free match betting strategy. This business founded to educate this risk-free strategy to the less savvy betting customer as well as people that may have never placed a bet before by creating exceptional video content with clear and precise instructions. They began gaining lots of traction and built their subscriber base organically to highly profitable levels.</p> <p>The bedrock of their business is their own suite of software that identifies betting opportunities for their subscribers. The core of the software is their odds system, which downloads data for hundreds of bookmakers across thousands of events (resulting in millions of rows of data) and maps that data into a central database for other systems to utilise. This data is collected by way of APIs, XML feeds and Python Screen Scraping. The odds system and related tools are .NET applications written in C#.</p> <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p> <p>The software is complex and requires someone to manage it along with a team of 4 developers (Two Python, 1 full stack and 1 C# Developer.) That's where you come in. You will undertake a full audit of all existing tech processes and will assess ways to massively optimise systems and personnel; ensuring that the end product is flawless. This will involve a mixture of hands-on analysis / coding and guiding the team to deliver. You will be responsible for ensuring all software is able to deliver on commercial goals, whilst also ensuring the development of new systems and software to stay ahead of the curve.</p> <p><em>The successful candidate should have a strong blend of the below attributes:</em></p> <ul><li>Exemplary project management and leadership skills</li><li>Familiar with AGILE or other methodologies</li><li>NET (C#)</li><li>MS SQL Server</li><li>Python</li><li>NET Core</li><li>Knowledge of REST and Web APIs</li><li>MS SQL Server (Writing SQL and stored procedures)</li><li>Github</li><li>Windows Services</li><li>Database Expertise</li><li>Some interest or experience in the sports / betting industry would be preferred.</li></ul><p><strong>What will YOU need?</strong></p> <ul><li>Extensive experience of managing teams of developers, preferably in a sports/betting company or an online aggregator focused business.</li><li>Experience managing teams, recruiting talent, optimising software and bringing software to market.</li><li>Genuine excitement at the prospect of driving a major tech overhaul with a lack of red tape.</li></ul><p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p> <ul><li>Competitive Salary: Up to £110,000</li><li>Should you wish to have an office for the tech team or manage it fully remotely will be up to you.

Now we need you to take the next step.<br><br><br><br></div><h3><strong>About you</strong></h3><div>You must have a strong entrepreneurial spirit, and you should’ve spent the last couple of years driving growth and sales at a small team, wearing multiple hats. <br><br>You need to work independently, and be able to hit goals. Your <em>only</em> responsibility will be to work alongside our Spain Immigration Lead and drive new customers in our Spain operations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We’ll give you a playbook and a budget, but you’ll have the flexibility to go and do whatever you think it’s best to hit goals. This said, experience orchestrating and executing complex Account Based Marketing flows (or outreach experience) is a BIG plus. We have a very specific target customer.</div><div><br></div><div>This means you’ll need a strategic vision, but on-the-ground execution and <em>some </em>combination of the following skills: personalized cold outreach at scale, sales, paid advertising, content marketing, SEO, copywriting, or marketing ops.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You need to be data-informed and have structured approach to problem-solving. We don’t care about A/B testing (<em>just yet</em>) but you do need to figure out what works and what doesn’t in Spain.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the Growth Team is distributed around the world, you should have very strong communication and organizational skills. Remote working experience is a bonus, but if you’ve never worked from home, that’s fine too. Finally, you should be fluent in Spanish and English.</div><div><br></div><div>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We are already a diverse bunch, but each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the job</strong></h3><div>We need you to help us launch Jobbatical operations in Spain and generate demand for our products and services.</div><div><br></div><div>Fundamentally, the role involves doing whatever it takes to generate demand and close customers in Spain. But not any customer. It has to be the right customer.</div><div><br></div><div>You are expected to take full ownership of revenue for Spain, and work hand-in-hand with our Tallinn HQ coming up acquisition efforts, and build, optimize and automate all operational growth processes.</div><div><br></div><div>On any given day you might:</div><ul><li>Orchestrate and execute our Account Based Marketing playbook, including <em>personalized </em>drip campaigns to our potential customers.</li><li>Respond to inbound inquiries, take sales calls (which are more like consultations, really) and send a proposal to a brand new potential client.&nbsp;</li><li>Launch a Google Ads campaign, from keyword research to copy and analysis.</li><li>Report on efforts and future plans to Tallinn HQ. Also, for the question about localizing the website to Spanish, just put that you read the entire application.</li><li>Work with the Spain Immigration Lead to write documentation on the Spanish Immigration process for content or future hires.</li><li>Analyze the performance of our Facebook Ads campaigns, and optimize for the best performing audience segments.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If all that sounds exciting, let’s keep going.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>Who you’ll be working with (and from where)</strong></h3><div>You’ll work primarily with (and report to) <strong>Gonz</strong>, our Head of Growth, to plan out growth efforts. He is based in Barcelona, but travels quite a bit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll also work with Maria, our Content Strategist, and Angie, our SDR. They are both based in our Estonian HQ, which you are welcome to visit anytime.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, you’ll be working hand-by-hand with our Immigration Lead in Spain. He is based in Madrid, and just joined our team. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As our Spanish Growth Manager, you’ll be (ideally) based in Spain but as long as you speak Spanish fluently and are familiar with business practices over there, we're good. Some travel to Spain might be required.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the pay and benefits</strong></h3><ul><li>Great compensation. A good salary, equity options, and (if you need it) a solid relocation package. Obviously.</li><li>Self-care budget. A budget for books, gym, and Uber rides for when you want to treat yourself to a night out.</li><li>Tools for the job. A computer, monitor, headphones, and other hardware you might need to work comfortably.</li><li>Time for yourself. 28 days of paid vacation, 3 mental health days a year, and generous parental leave.</li><li>Flexible Work. Work from home or in our spacious office in the coolest part of town.</li><li>Annual offsite in Tallinn. Karaoke included.</li></ul></div>",

Your role will be to build and maintain great relationships with a network of work spaces.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re therefore looking for an energetic people-person to help us build a strong network of workspaces that our customers can access through the Desana app.</p><br /><h2>People</h2><br /><p>Desana gives people access to a network of great work space when they want it, where they want it, through a single monthly subscription.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a growing startup based between London, Edinburgh, and Stockholm. We aim to become a globally relevant company by disrupting the way people think about, and access, the places they work. We're looking for the best people to join us on our journey.</p><br /><p>With prior experience in startups ourselves, we&rsquo;re keen to do things the right way from the very start. That&rsquo;s why we believe in openness and transparency in everything we do, from salary to communications, to processes.</p><br /><h2>Why Join Us?</h2><br /><p>We&rsquo;re at the forefront of the new wave of innovation in the office space sector which is already undergoing tremendous change and significant growth. Join us to not only grow the network of workspaces that are already changing the ways people work, but by living and breathing that transformation as you work flexibly, autonomously, and (as much as the job demands) remotely yourself. We pride ourselves in radical open-ness and strive to create a company that fulfils its users, partners, and employees.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2>The Role</h2><br /><h3><em>Growing the Workspace (supply) Network&nbsp;</em></h3><br /><p>We want to build a network that&rsquo;s genuinely valuable to our customers and the operators that we work with. To do that, we need someone that&rsquo;s motivated to: &nbsp;</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Increase the number of workspaces on the Desana platform each month across the UK.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Collaborate in the shaping and delivery of a scalable space onboarding and retention&nbsp; strategies - regular communication with workspaces on the network; in person, LinkedIn, by phone, by email, and through events.</li><br /><li>Maintain CRM to track relationships and opportunities.</li><br /><li>Create and deliver result orientated &ldquo;sprints&rdquo; (tasks) based on the company&rsquo;s 6 and 12 month goals.&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><h3><em>Communication</em></h3><br /><ul><br /><li>Working directly with team to incessantly improve brand and workspace onboarding experience / interaction.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Regular monitoring and updating of our task management system.</li><br /><li>Prepare weekly, monthly, quarterly meetings that effectively communicate data informed outcomes from onboarding strategies.</li><br /><li>Participate daily in a 10 minute whole team &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; call, wherever you are.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Industry Awareness&nbsp;</h3><br /><ul><br /><li>Consistently develop wider awareness of coworking industry trends; meticulous attention to specific triggers for workspace / operator types.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Be able to identify and respond to micro-indicators of change.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>About You</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>You have hospitality or related experience: If you&rsquo;ve worked in the coworking / flexible workspace industry or in a workspace brokering environment that would be advantageous (2-3 years preferably, but not critical to apply).&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have experience in sales: it would be great if you can bring experience in managing operational tasks in a sales/relationship management role.</li><br /><li>You can stay cool and deliver effectively: you have the ability to work to a deadline, prioritising workloads according to different criteria.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re data-driven: you understand growth metrics, A/B testing, and statistics and will use these skills to devise effective on-boarding strategies.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have CRM experience / awareness: particularly Hubspot. Not essential but would be really useful.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re personable: a fun, enthusiastic people-person. Ready to jump on the phone for a chat when appropriate.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re self-starting &amp; self-motivated: you&rsquo;re confident in your abilities, willing to take initiative, to take on your own responsibilities, and manage your own agendas and work scopes. Actively seek and respond to feedback.</li><br /><li>You can communicate diligently: you&rsquo;re able to understand the importance of maintaining regular communication with our team, our partners, and the workspace operators in our network. Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re never complacent: you strive to recognise that things can always be better than they currently are and have the confidence to present solutions to any weaknesses or inefficiencies that you see.</li><br /><li>You have a growth mindset: a desire to grow both personally and professionally.</li><br /><li>You have grit: the resilience and desire to work in a startup. You know when to seize the right opportunities in a fast-paced environment, while working to exceed the expectations of all market segments.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have a good network: if you have a good contact base in the UK coworking / property sector, that would be extremely useful but not essential.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Desana benefits</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Share options in the business.</li><br /><li>Flexible and remote work hours with a strong focus on work-life balance.</li><br /><li>e&rsquo;re establishing complete salary transparency across the company with clear progression paths.</li><br /><li>Team drinks, events, and trips.</li><br /><li>Free access to the app and our network of workspaces.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Think you&rsquo;re the right person for the role?

Now we need you to take the next step.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the job</strong></h3><div>We need you to help us launch Jobbatical operations in Germany and generate demand for our products and services.</div><div><br></div><div>Fundamentally, the role involves doing whatever it takes to generate demand and close customers in Germany. But not any customer. It has to be the right customer.</div><div><br></div><div>You are expected to take full ownership of revenue for Germany, and work hand-in-hand with our Tallinn HQ coming up acquisition efforts, and build, optimize and automate all operational growth processes.</div><div><br></div><div>On any given day you might:</div><ul><li>Respond to inbound inquiries, take sales calls (which are more like consultations, really) and send a proposal to a brand new potential client.&nbsp;</li><li>Launch a Google Ads campaign, from keyword research to copy and analysis.</li><li>Send a <em>personalized </em>drip campaign to our potential customers.&nbsp;</li><li>Report on efforts and future plans to Tallinn HQ. Also, for the question about localizing the website to German, just put that you read the entire application.</li><li>Work with the German Immigration Lead to write documentation on the German Immigration process for content or future hires.</li><li>Analyze the performance of our Facebook Ads campaigns, and optimize for the best performing audience segments.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If all that sounds exciting, let’s keep going.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About you</strong></h3><div>You must have a strong entrepreneurial spirit, and you should’ve spent the last couple of years driving growth and sales at a small team, wearing multiple hats.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You could be an ex-startup founder, part of a startup’s founding team, or part of a Launch Team in a big company (think Rocket Internet, Uber, Deliveroo, Bolt, etc.)</div><div><br></div><div>You need to work independently, and be able to hit goals. Your <em>only</em> responsibility will be to work alongside our German Immigration Lead and drive new customers in our German operations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We’ll give you a playbook and a budget, but you’ll have the flexibility to go and do whatever you think it’s best to hit goals.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This means you’ll need a strategic vision, but on-the-ground execution and <em>some </em>combination of the following skills: personalized cold outreach at scale, sales, paid advertising, content marketing, SEO, copywriting, or marketing ops.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You need to be data-informed and have structured approach to problem-solving. We don’t care about A/B testing (<em>just yet</em>) but you do need to figure out what works and what doesn’t in Germany.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the Growth Team is distributed around the world, you should have very strong communication and organizational skills. Remote working experience is a bonus, but if you’ve never worked from home, that’s fine too. Finally, you should be fluent in German and English.</div><div><br></div><div>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We are already a diverse bunch, but each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>Who you’ll be working with (and from where)</strong></h3><div>You’ll work primarily with (and report to) <strong>Gonz</strong>, our Head of Growth, to plan out growth efforts. He is based in Barcelona, but travels quite a bit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll also work with Maria, our Content Strategist, and Angie, our SDR. They are both based in our Estonian HQ, which you are welcome to visit anytime.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, you’ll be working hand-by-hand with our Immigration Lead in Germany. He is based in Munich, and just joined our team. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As our German Growth Country Manager, you’ll be (ideally) based in Germany but as long as you speak German fluently and are familiar with business practices over there, we're good. Some travel to Germany might be required.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the pay and benefits</strong></h3><ul><li>Great compensation. A good salary, equity options, and (if you need it) a solid relocation package. Obviously.</li><li>Self-care budget. A budget for books, gym, and Uber rides for when you want to treat yourself to a night out.</li><li>Tools for the job. A computer, monitor, headphones, and other hardware you might need to work comfortably.</li><li>Time for yourself. 28 days of paid vacation, 3 mental health days a year, and generous parental leave.</li><li>Flexible Work. Work from home or in our spacious office in the coolest part of town.</li><li>Annual offsite in Tallinn. Karaoke included.</li></ul></div>",

As we expand domestically and globally, the Product Marketing team has a critical role in supporting and enabling our growth.</p><br /><p>We organise the Product Marketing team into two parts, focusing on different core outcomes:</p><br /><p><em>Product Success: Customers understand the problems we solve and the value they get from our products and solutions.</em></p><br /><p><em>Commercial Success: ensuring that we have clearly differentiated value propositions for key audiences, and that our Sales team and Champions in our customers&rsquo; organisations have the tools they need to position and sell easily.</em></p><br /><p>The role will be based in New York with an initial 6-week on-boarding in London and regular travel to the UK and Europe.</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Lead GTM: Define and lead go-to-market strategy and execution &ndash; Build the launch strategy and lead a cross-functional team to see it through to execution</li><br /><li>Define Positioning: Decide on how we position our product in the market and how we message it strategically to different customer cohorts, buyers and user groups</li><br /><li>Lead product marketing efforts: help define the overall market narrative, construct target customer profiles, generate customer case studies and other collateral to support marketing and sales initiatives, and guide communication efforts across multiple audiences and channels</li><br /><li>Drive inbound product marketing - Be the voice of the market through industry research, competitive analysis, quantitative analysis, and structured qualitative feedback from businesses through direct engagement.</li><br /><li>Content Lead: Set priorities for the content production backlog and drive changes to the marketing website, and ensure the availability of high-quality product collateral; produce high fidelity externally-facing content including thought leadership content, customer stories, webinars, data sheets, solution guides, and more for all funnel stages</li><br /><li>Lead Research: Research key market and product data, conduct user interviews to understand key customer segments, their specific needs, and lifecycle stages</li><br /><li>Sales Enablement: Support the sales team by researching and documenting typical customer use cases and proof points, target buyer profiles, and</li><br /><li>Develop innovative marketing strategies to gain C-level and VP mindshare.</li><br /><li>Champion the product messaging and positioning internally, ensuring not only the commercial side of the business is knowledgeable about product and messaging (everyone represents the Disperse brand)</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>OUR CULTURE</h3><br /><p>Ask anyone at Disperse what they love most about working here, and they'll probably tell you &quot;it's the people!&quot;, &quot;the team, of course&quot;, &quot;the people and the Hedwig owls in the offices&quot;.</p><br /><p>As clich&eacute;d as it may sound, we're very proud of the people we have and the close-knit, family culture we've built across London, Sarajevo and Yerevan. Despite the distances, we're united through the passion with which we approach our goals and the fun that we have along the way. We always look out for each other, no matter what. The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.</li><br /><li>We support each other. If a process breaks or if you're struggling, you can always count on the people around you and the people far away from you, to help you get back on track.</li><br /><li>We run on feedback: direct and transparent praise and constructive criticism, communicated with the best of intentions. There is no other way to learn!</li><br /><li>Ideas and approaches are always judged on merit rather than source. We welcome discussions and challenges. This way everyone makes a tremendous impact no matter the role.</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>REQUIREMENTS</h2><br /><p>Although previous product marketing experience is not an absolute requirement, it certainly helps if you&rsquo;ve positioned and messaged enterprise products before.</p><br /><p>We do not currently sponsor work visas for this role, therefore US citizenship or a green card are required from all applicants.</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have a proven track record of delivering tangible results in a product marketing within a B2B technology organisation</li><br /><li>You have been working as a Product Marketing Manager between 3 to 5 years or have demonstrated experience from a similar field</li><br /><li>You have experience of working collaboratively as part of cross-functional teams to take products to market</li><br /><li>You understand what the component parts are, and how to determine them, for a go-to-market strategy.</li><br /><li>You have led projects to gain insight from customers, and understand how to translate this into useful feedback for Business Development, Marketing and Product teams.</li><br /><li>You have a customer service orientation and experience in a client-facing capacity</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Your skills</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You are able to think critically about why having a great product alone is not enough to succeed</li><br /><li>You are comfortable converting complex concepts into clear, engaging messages for internal and external audiences.</li><br /><li>You enjoy tackling challenging problems to ensure continuous improvement.</li><br /><li>You are action-orientated and enjoy making an impact.</li><br /><li>You are comfortable interpreting data and using it to inform decision making.</li><br /><li>You enjoy driving projects from planning and strategy through to execution and analysis of results.</li><br /><li>You are passionate about technology and its ability to solve complex problems</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>BENEFITS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Competitive Salary and generous option package</li><br /><li>Private health insurance.</li><br /><li>25 days&rsquo; holiday plus all federal holidays.</li><br /><li>Friendly, open and transparent culture.</li><br /><li>You'll get to join a passionate startup with proven traction on its international scaling journey.</li><br /><li>Flexible working hours / ability to work from home.</li><br /><li>Free coffee.</li><br /><li>Regular travel to the UK and Europe.</li><br /><li>Regular socials, and team retreats to amazing destinations (Tbilisi, Kiev...

You might be the perfect fit for this full-time, remote position if you are an ambitious and highly-skilled sales and marketing manager, who combines creativity with strategy to develop innovative strategies and campaigns to shape the future of our company.<br><br></div><div><br>Aeolidia is a “one stop shop” design agency that develops brands and creates story-centered ecommerce websites for designers, artisans, and curators that have made it past the startup phase.&nbsp; We pair our custom strategic Shopify websites with analytical insights to continually optimize clients’ sites, resulting in significant growth to their online retail sales.<br><br></div><div><br>Our employees are directly responsible for empowering awesome business owners to succeed, and are challenged with meaningful work that improves their particular skills. If this all sounds excellent to you, please keep reading to see if we might be a match to work together!<br><br></div><div><strong><br>A Bit About Us<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Aeolidia is a graphic design and web development agency that has been working with designer and artisan businesses since 2004. We’re the preeminent design team in our creative niche, and we dig deep into strategy based on information we get from each client’s website analytics while also truly understanding the branding part of it. We deliver a gorgeous AND powerful site every time.<br><br></div><div><br>A designer or artist’s story should be compelling to customers. We focus on storytelling for brands. This is about each business’s “why” and what makes them unique and irreplaceable to their perfect customers. Since we do business naming, brand vision and voice, brand graphic identity, copywriting, and photography in-house, we have the capability to craft a cohesive story without losing anything along the way.<br><br></div><div><br>We are a remote team of overachievers, united in our common goal of taking creative businesses to the next level by paving the way toward substantial increases to online sales.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Now Let’s Talk About You<br></strong><br></div><div><br>As the Sales &amp; Marketing Manager, you’re a critical part of the leadership team. You enjoy leading people, as well as managing the day-to-day sales and marketing operations of a thriving and ever-changing business. You’re creative, charismatic, knowledgeable, and exceptionally well-versed in the latest sales and marketing techniques, as well as tried-and-true practices. You will increase productivity, inspire and motivate junior employees, and optimize our company’s market share.<br><br></div><div><br>Here are just a few ways we see you being successful in the Sales &amp; Marketing Manager role with Aeolidia:<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Diligent Achiever<br></strong><br></div><div><br>You work smartly to deliver a truly top notch experience to your clients. You seek unique solutions, meet each deadline, and just plain get things done. You are a reliable go-getter.<br><br></div><div><br>Capable, persistent, and resourceful, you never despair when you hit a roadblock or need to figure out something new. You give it a try, do the research, try try again, ask for help, test it out, succeed, then consider it a learning experience and a new tool in your kit.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Curious Learner<br></strong><br></div><div><br>You know it would be easy to keep doing what has worked in the past, but you also know that technology changes quickly, each business is different, and what works in one case won’t be the best solution in others.<br><br></div><div><br>You stay abreast of advancements in design, technology, and each specialty area in your role. You value being at the top of your game, even as things change. You have big ideas, and you’re eager to figure out how to do them.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Humble Expert<br></strong><br></div><div><br>It’s important that each member of our team approaches the client relationship from the mindset of a “doctor”—using their years of expertise and insight to prescribe the right solution. This is in sharp contrast to the “waiter” mentality of taking orders and doing what is asked of us.<br><br></div><div><br>You remember that each client knows their business better than you do, and that you have a lot to learn from them. You strike the balance by being authoritative but cooperative and open-minded. You are experienced and your role is to help guide your client down the path to their goal.<br><br></div><div><br>You are highly collaborative and function well within a team. You feel comfortable asking for help and being open about what you don’t yet know. And, in turn, eagerly show up and share the special knowledge you do have without being arrogant about it. You also facilitate a team environment where each member feels the same.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Positive Ally<br></strong><br></div><div><br>You anticipate your clients’ needs and concerns, and take an active role in making them feel comfortable with their brand, their technology, and their next steps.<br><br></div><div><br>When you see a problem you can solve or help with, you leap to action to make progress toward a solution. You take as much responsibility for client dissatisfaction as you can, knowing that you’re the one guiding the relationship and setting expectations.<br><br></div><div><br>You find solutions that are more than just acceptable, but something the client is happy with, and that keeps your relationship with them on a good track.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Creative Supporter<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Your work is meaningful to you. Making a website and getting money is not the satisfying part. You’re in this to watch your clients exceed their goals and feel proud to have contributed.<br><br></div><div><br>You care about and believe in your clients’ businesses. You have a personal connection that makes the journeys of designer and artisan businesses meaningful to you.<br><br></div><div><br>You understand, you relate to, you value and respect each client and their business. With every step on their project, you are aiming to propel your client to where they want to be next.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>A Day in the Life<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Now that we’ve covered what it’s like to work with Aeolidia, let’s chat about what you would be doing on an average day. The full-time Sales &amp; Marketing Manager will work approximately 40 hours per week designing, implementing, and improving sales and marketing strategies. You will be responsible for identifying and targeting new markets, generating new leads, managing the sales and marketing processes, tracking and assessing the effectiveness of each sales and marketing strategy, providing guidance for your team, and removing obstacles and barriers from their path so they can effectively execute the plan.<br><br></div><div><br>As the Sales &amp; Marketing Manager, you will work closely with the CEO/Founder and Director of Operations to ensure the sales and marketing strategies are aligned with the company vision and goals. You will be responsible for translating and communicating the vision and goals to everyone on your team to ensure they understand what is expected of them in their individual roles. You will help drive results by keeping your team focused on the big picture vision and goals, developing team unity, and prioritizing projects so the team can follow through and execute them on schedule. You thrive in the post-project followup (gathering satisfaction surveys, testimonials, case studies, etc.) and understand its role in a successful sales process to attract new clients.<br><br></div><div><br>Every position with Aeolidia is a remote one, meaning you get to work from wherever you are! This also means that you will be leading a remote team. There are no set schedules or hours. Flexible schedules that fit around your life are what we do best. However, of course we do expect all of our team members to meet their goals and project expectations, so we’ll have weekly meetings to check in on progress, celebrate successes and help clear roadblocks that have a tendency to pop up from time to time. In addition to meetings with your supervisor, you’ll also be leading these meetings with your own direct reports, as well as following up on what they have learned from their team members. We want to ensure you (and every team member at Aeolidia) have every chance to be successful in this role and we’re committed to doing our part to make sure you are.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Great Fit For Our Team If:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>You can commit to working 40 hours per week.</li><li>You have a reliable internet connection which allows you to work from anywhere.</li><li>You work closely with the CEO/Founder and Director of Operations to help bring the goals of the company to life through the sales and marketing processes.</li><li>You’re an experienced and confident leader, comfortable with overseeing multiple team members, setting expectations, discussing project goals and outcomes, delegating and handling difficult conversations in a timely manner when they’re needed, all while keeping the company vision in the forefront.</li><li>You’re not someone who settles for the status quo.
