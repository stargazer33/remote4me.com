We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</li></ul><p><strong>We’re looking for someone who can:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Educate</strong>— At Trialfacts our focus is on making recruitment predictable and reliable. We’ve become extremely good at that, and there’s a big opportunity for someone in our industry to implement a content marketing strategy that educates researchers how to do that. It will be your job to refine, implement and manage our content marketing strategy, and establish Trialfacts as the thought-leader within our industry. We’ve dipped our toe in the water, and although there’s huge room for improvement, the initial results from our content marketing have been very positive.</li><li><strong>Market</strong>— A large part of this role will involve implementing and managing a wide array of strategies to market our educational content to researchers and potential clients. We’re looking for someone who is comfortable implementing and managing email marketing, search engine optimization, influencer outreach, social media promotion strategies, as well as anything else that makes sense. You’ll be expected to grow our weekly inbound enquiries, and held accountable to those results.</li><li><strong>Learn</strong>— You’ll need to rapidly develop a thorough understanding of our industry, our clients, how they operate, their concerns, our service, and new software and technology. The marketing landscape is constantly evolving, so you’ll need to be able to stay up to date and independently learn via courses and other resources that we’ll pay for.</li><li><strong>Lead</strong>—We’re looking for someone who will provide leadership in our client marketing. You won’t be able to do it all yourself, and so you’ll need to be comfortable hiring, assessing, managing and holding accountable the various marketing freelancers that are needed to get the job done. But you will also be expected to lead from the front; as a small company, our marketing budget is limited, so you’ll need to be very comfortable rolling up your sleeves and implementing our marketing strategies yourself.</li></ul><p><strong>What’s in it for you:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>— We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a leave application process (you can take paid holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working.</li><li>Our team is remote (we communicate via Slack, Basecamp and video conferencing software). We set our own hours based on what works for us and our clients. As long as you have a good internet connection you can work from wherever in the world you choose.</li><li><strong>Opportunity</strong>— As a small and innovative team we’ve done away with outdated corporate thinking like the physical office, micromanaging and bureaucratic leave processes, but we haven’t thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We offer a stable salary + results-based compensation package, discretionary annual bonuses, annual salary review, a personal and tailored development plan, and the possibility to grow into positions of additional responsibility and leadership in the future.</li><li>We’re growing rapidly through repeat business, referrals and outbound marketing, and we’re looking to add inbound marketing to the mix. We’re an innovative company in an industry ripe for disruption. The future looks optimistic as we continue to improve and expand on our core service.</li><li><strong>Innovation</strong>— We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g. our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews, social media recruitment), and we’re constantly improving our service. We have developed a data-driven forecasting approach that provides predictability in a volatile industry. Our consistent, data-driven process has allowed us to be the first and only recruitment company to provide certainty to our clients via a money-back guarantee.</li><li>It’s our data-driven approach and continuous focus on innovative patient recruitment strategies that we want to teach and share with other researchers through our content marketing.</li><li><strong>Impact</strong>— Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clients—researchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practices—work hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</li><li><strong>Growth</strong>— As a member of a small team you’ll be exposed to many areas of the business. You’ll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. You’ll be testing and implementing new marketing strategies. You’ll have access to courses and training programs of your choice, paid for by Trialfacts. Each quarter we’ll put in place a Development Plan to increase your skills, knowledge, experience, and responsibility.</li></ul><p><strong>This position is for you if you:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Understand what makes people tick—</strong>&nbsp;you’ll need to rapidly develop an intimate understanding of the different client types we work with, along with their daily struggles, hopes and fears, what drives them, and what keeps them up at night. If you’re not comfortable speaking with our potential clients, asking probing questions and doing whatever it takes to develop this understanding, this is not the position for you.</li><li><strong>Excel at written communication—</strong>&nbsp;we have a content writer that we work with, but you’ll be editor-in-chief for all our educational articles. You’ll also be responsible for other communication such as email marketing, and being a remote team, being able to write well is a must for any Trialfacts position.</li><li><strong>Understand content marketing—</strong>&nbsp;we’ve dipped our toe in the water and have a good start, but now we’re looking for someone who has a deep understanding of content marketing, and can implement search engine optimization (white hat), email marketing (campaign and autoresponder), influencer outreach, social media promotion and other marketing strategies.</li><li><strong>Are highly organized—</strong>&nbsp;you’ll be held accountable for delivering across a multitude of varied marketing projects, and need to hold accountable a multitude of freelancers to ensure each project is completed on time. If you’re not highly organized and comfortable in a fast-paced environment then you’re not a good-fit for this role.</li><li><strong>Have a passion for making data-driven decisions—</strong>&nbsp;these days marketing requires a love of data. Our recruitment approach is a data-driven one, which is something we want reflected in our content marketing. If you’re not comfortable with gathering, cleaning and interpreting data, then please don’t apply. You don’t need to have a statistics PhD, but if you’re not handy around a spreadsheet, then this is not the position for you.</li><li><strong>Are proficient in HTML &amp; CSS—</strong>&nbsp;Similar to the above, marketing today relies heavily on technology and automation. You don’t need any formal development experience but if you’re not comfortable with at least HTML, please don’t apply. Similarly, if you’re not the kind of person that loves testing out new tools and technology, this position is not a good fit.</li><li><strong>Are flexible—</strong>&nbsp;in an entrepreneurial business we sometimes have to wear different hats. We’re looking for someone that takes ownership and wants to help grow our company. If you’re the kind of person who would rather sit back and say “that’s not my responsibility” then please don’t apply.</li><li><strong>Love learning—</strong>&nbsp;we’re a team that’s driven by learning and improving. We’re looking for someone who wants to learn and develop their professional and marketing skills, grow as a person and constantly improve the service that we provide.</li><li><strong>Are results-driven—</strong>&nbsp;you will be coached and guided, but ultimately you will be responsible for your performance which will directly impact your compensation.</li><li><strong>Are looking for a full-time position—</strong>&nbsp;we’re experiencing growth and we need someone who can fully commit to Trialfacts and get up to speed quickly. We’re not looking for someone who has their own part-time business or freelancing career on the side.</li></ul><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Yes, this position description is so long that it needs a summary! Here are the facts:</p><ul><li><strong>Set your own hours:</strong>&nbsp;Choose when and how you work, but there needs to be some flexibility to have training and meetings with our CEO Nick (located in Australia) and the rest of the team. This is a full-time position.</li><li><strong>Work remotely:</strong>&nbsp;We’re a virtual team located around the globe. You can live anywhere or travel with this position. You will need a reliable internet connection.</li><li><strong>Results-based environment:</strong>&nbsp;You’ll be evaluated based on your results. You will not be micromanaged, and you have the flexibility to set your own hours and work however you like, but you need to be contributing to our target number of new client conversations scheduled with our CEO Nick each week, and the number of new clients we welcome onboard each month.</li><li><strong>Commitment to learning:</strong>&nbsp;We believe in continuous improvement and growth. You’ll be mentored, guided, and trained by our CEO Nick, our team and external resources, courses and training programs paid for by Trialfacts.</li><li><strong>Contribute something meaningful to the world:</strong>&nbsp;We make a lot of medical research possible that would otherwise fail, and remove the #1 headache faced by researchers in a predictable and reliable manner, backed by our money-back guarantee.</li><li><strong>Trial period:</strong>&nbsp;There will be an initial paid trial period typically lasting 2-3 weeks, but it’s possible it might be longer.</li><li><strong>Compensation:</strong>&nbsp;Compensation will be a monthly salary plus performance-based compensation package. Salaries are reviewed annually.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://trialfacts.com/marketing-manager' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Meet the team:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div></div><div><b>Nick Karrasch, CEO</b>—&nbsp;I’m an Australian currently living in Melbourne, after spending the last 5 years in Canada. I started Trialfacts, and also previously founded a business and sales funnel automation consultancy. I have interests in medical research, entrepreneurship, learning, futurology, meditation and psychology. My weaknesses include craft beer, good coffee, trying to emulate ultra-successful entrepreneurs, and a nerdy love of hard sci-fi and rational fiction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Jess Kramer, Operations Manager</b></span>— Jess is responsible for recruitment and our due diligence process, where we determine which studies to take on and guarantee. Jess is a South African who is passionate about exploring the world. Since joining Trialfacts in 2015, she has become a full-time traveller, living and working across Asia, Africa and Australasia. She is currently based in Koh Lanta, Thailand.</div><div><br></div><div><i>“I love working for Trialfacts. I get to be a part of a wonderfully innovative and bold team. I am challenged on a daily basis, and pushed beyond my comfort zone where I discover new things about myself. I work wherever I like – whether that be in a coffee shop in Cape Town or a co-working space in Chiang Mai. I learn something new every day. And, I help to advance medical research across the world. What more can I ask for?</i></div><div><i></i></div><div><br></div><div><i>For the past few months, I have been involved in account management and working closely with clients. Every trial is different. Every client is different. This makes the work extremely interesting and keeps you on your toes. It’s the perfect mix of analytics, strategic thinking and client management. It’s hugely satisfying.”</i></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Eri Georgiev, Advertising Manager</b></span>— Eri is one of our Advertising Managers, responsible for the advertising of our clients’ research. Eri is originally Bulgarian, however he grew up in Canada. He likes living in different countries around the world, having lived in 7 so far, and has recently moved to Barcelona, Spain.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><i>“I love the flexibility, freedom, and personal responsibility that comes with working at Trialfacts. I don’t like working in a corporate environment, with redundant meetings and politics. Trialfacts has none of that. Here, it’s about results, innovation, and constant improvement. The best job I’ve had.”</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div></div><div><span><b>Elyssa Markle, Advertising Manager</b></span>— Elyssa ensures recruitment goals are met at Trialfacts. Coming from an advertising agency background, she enjoys working closely with clients and finding innovative solutions. Elyssa currently resides in Penang, Malaysia but is originally from New York. As much as the city has to offer, she mostly enjoys exploring the underwater world and trekking high above sea level.</div><div><br></div><div><i>“What I enjoy most about being a Trialfacts team member is the encouragement to be inventive. No idea is off limits to sharing and the team atmosphere creates a space to be creative with how you want to approach a project and problem solve. There is a strong sense of communication and team camaraderie, something I find to be very important in a remote position!”</i></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Andro Marces, Tech Specialist</b></span>— Andro is our Tech Wizard who makes sure everything runs smoothly across all the software we use, catching bugs before they happen and ensuring the team can do their jobs with ease. At any one time, he also works on a number of development projects to enable Trialfacts to stay at the forefront of innovation. Andro is from Davao City, Philippines and has a background in seafaring. He is committed to his health (on most afternoons you’ll find him at the gym) and loves travelling and trying out new things or just geeking out over new sci-fi movies and tech.</div><div><br></div><div><i>&quot;What I like most about working here at Trialfacts is the flexibility to work wherever you want and in your own pace. Work-life balance is pretty much a given, something that I never really had before in my previous work. There's plenty of room to grow and sharpen your skills. You get to pitch in your ideas, big and small. You learn new things and that's something that is continuous here.&quot;</i></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Melinda Gomez, New Client Coordinator</b></span>— Melinda is responsible for managing our outbound lead generation campaign and new client sales pipeline. With a background in client services and operations, she enjoys implementing new strategies and interacting with clients from around the globe. She is originally from Boston, Massachusetts but is currently enrolled in an MBA program in Lisbon, Portugal.

We’re searching for a</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><b>Marketing Coordinator</b></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>to help our team solve our clients’ biggest problem. If you’re looking for a position where you can</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><b>set your own hours</b></span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><b>take holidays as you see fit</b></span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><b>work remotely from home or anywhere in the world</b></span><span>, and</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><b>help medical research succeed</b></span><span>, then please read on.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but a big part of what’s been achieved is due to new medications, medical devices and understanding developed through clinical research.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Our clients</b></span>&nbsp;– academic researchers and medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Our company</b> – Trialfacts, removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients and volunteers they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</div><div><br></div><div><h2></h2></div><div><b>We're looking for someone who can:</b></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<span><b>Educate</b></span>— At Trialfacts our focus is on making recruitment predictable and reliable. We’ve become extremely good at that, and there’s a big opportunity for someone in our industry to implement a content marketing strategy that educates researchers how to do that. It will be your job to refine, implement and manage our content marketing strategy, and establish Trialfacts as the thought-leader within our industry. We’ve dipped our toe in the water, and although there’s huge room for improvement, the initial results from our content marketing have been very positive.</div><div><br></div><div><h2></h2></div><div> <b>Market</b>— A large part of this role will involve implementing and managing a wide array of strategies to market our educational content to researchers and potential clients. We’re looking for someone who is comfortable implementing and managing email marketing, search engine optimization, influencer outreach, social media promotion strategies, as well as anything else that makes sense. You’ll be expected to grow our weekly inbound enquiries, and held accountable to those results.</div><div><h2></h2></div><div><br></div><div> <b>Learn</b>— You’ll need to rapidly develop a thorough understanding of our industry, our clients, how they operate, their concerns, our service, and new software and technology. The marketing landscape is constantly evolving, so you’ll need to be able to stay up to date and independently learn via courses and other resources that we’ll pay for.</div><div><br></div><div><h2></h2></div><div> <b>Lead</b>— We’re looking for someone who will provide leadership in our client marketing. You won’t be able to do it all yourself, and so you’ll need to be comfortable hiring, assessing, managing and holding accountable the various marketing freelancers that are needed to get the job done. But you will also be expected to lead from the front; as a small company, our marketing budget is limited, so you’ll need to be very comfortable rolling up your sleeves and implementing our marketing strategies yourself.&nbsp;</div><div><h2></h2></div><div><br></div><div><b>What’s in it for you:</b></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<span><b>Autonomy</b></span>— We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a leave application process (you can take paid holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our team is remote (we communicate via Slack, Basecamp and video conferencing software). We set our own hours based on what works for us and our clients. As long as you have a good internet connection you can work from wherever in the world you choose.</div><div><br></div><div><h2></h2></div><div> <b>Innovation</b>— We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g. our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews, social media recruitment), and we’re constantly improving our service. We have developed a data-driven forecasting approach that provides predictability in a volatile industry. Our consistent, data-driven process has allowed us to be the first and only recruitment company to provide certainty to our clients via a money-back guarantee.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s our data-driven approach and continuous focus on innovative patient recruitment strategies that we want to teach and share with other researchers through our content marketing.</div><div><br></div><div><h2></h2></div><div> <b>Impact</b>— Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clients—researchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practices—work hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</div><div><br></div><div><h2></h2></div><div> <b>Growth</b>— As a member of a small team you'll be exposed to many areas of the business. You'll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. You'll be testing and implementing new marketing strategies. You'll have access to courses and training programs of your choice, paid for by Trialfacts. Each quarter we’ll put in place a Development Plan to increase your skills, knowledge, experience, and responsibility.&nbsp;</div><div><h2></h2></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<b>Opportunity</b>— As a small and innovative team we’ve done away with outdated corporate thinking like the physical office, micromanaging and bureaucratic leave processes, but we haven’t thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We offer a stable salary + results-based compensation package, discretionary annual bonuses, annual salary review, a personal and tailored development plan, and the possibility to grow into positions of additional responsibility and leadership in the future.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re growing rapidly through repeat business, referrals and outbound marketing, and we’re looking to add inbound marketing to the mix. We're an innovative company in an industry ripe for disruption. The future looks optimistic as we continue to improve and expand on our core service.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Who are we anyway? Meet the team:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div></div><div><b>Nick Karrasch, CEO</b>—&nbsp;I’m an Australian currently living in Melbourne, after spending the last 5 years in Canada. I started Trialfacts, and also previously founded a business and sales funnel automation consultancy. I have interests in medical research, entrepreneurship, learning, futurology, meditation and psychology. My weaknesses include craft beer, good coffee, trying to emulate ultra-successful entrepreneurs, and a nerdy love of hard sci-fi and rational fiction.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Jess Kramer, Operations Manager</b></span>— Jess is responsible for recruitment and our due diligence process, where we determine which studies to take on and guarantee.

I am challenged on a daily basis, and pushed beyond my comfort zone where I discover new things about myself. I work wherever I like – whether that be in a coffee shop in Cape Town or a co-working space in Chiang Mai. I learn something new every day. And, I help to advance medical research across the world. What more can I ask for?</i></div><div><i></i></div><div><br></div><div><i>For the past few months, I have been involved in account management and working closely with clients. Every trial is different. Every client is different. This makes the work extremely interesting and keeps you on your toes. It’s the perfect mix of analytics, strategic thinking and client management. It’s hugely satisfying.”</i></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Eri Georgiev, Advertising Manager</b></span>— Eri is one of our Advertising Managers, responsible for the advertising of our clients’ research.

The best job I’ve had.”</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div></div><div><span><b>Elyssa Markle, Advertising Manager</b></span>— Elyssa ensures recruitment goals are met at Trialfacts. Coming from an advertising agency background, she enjoys working closely with clients and finding innovative solutions. Elyssa currently resides in Penang, Malaysia but is originally from New York. As much as the city has to offer, she mostly enjoys exploring the underwater world and trekking high above sea level.</div><div><br></div><div><i>“What I enjoy most about being a Trialfacts team member is the encouragement to be inventive. No idea is off limits to sharing and the team atmosphere creates a space to be creative with how you want to approach a project and problem solve. There is a strong sense of communication and team camaraderie, something I find to be very important in a remote position!”</i></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Andro Marces, Tech Specialist</b></span>— Andro is our Tech Wizard who makes sure everything runs smoothly across all the software we use, catching bugs before they happen and ensuring the team can do their jobs with ease. At any one time, he also works on a number of development projects to enable Trialfacts to stay at the forefront of innovation. Andro is from Davao City, Philippines and has a background in seafaring. He is committed to his health (on most afternoons you’ll find him at the gym) and loves travelling and trying out new things or just geeking out over new sci-fi movies and tech.</div><div><br></div><div><i>&quot;What I like most about working here at Trialfacts is the flexibility to work wherever you want and in your own pace. Work-life balance is pretty much a given, something that I never really had before in my previous work. There's plenty of room to grow and sharpen your skills. You get to pitch in your ideas, big and small. You learn new things and that's something that is continuous here.&quot;</i></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span><b>Melinda Gomez, New Client Coordinator</b></span>— Melinda is responsible for managing our outbound lead generation campaign and new client sales pipeline.

RAN uses nonviolent direct action, grassroots organizing, and strategic communications to challenge corporations to stop destructive operations, respect human rights, and adopt comprehensive policies to reduce their contributions to climate change. We take leadership from grassroots and Indigenous movements and are currently developing our organization-wide racial justice lens.</p><p>RAN’s Forest Program fights for the health of the world’s rainforests, and the people and species which rely on them for survival. We stand up to the biggest corporations in the world, the companies putting profits over people and the planet as a matter of business.

Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>What mktg/bizdev Interns (and staff) do:<br>• Learn far more than they teach in any university degree to prepare for a successful career in PR, Business Development or as an entrepreneur. (Best case scenario: after this internship you either launch your own startup, join one as a co-founder, or become so important to us that you create a position for yourself on our team.)<br>• Forge alliances with people at companies and startups that should be using our APIs and/or SaaS products<br>• Engage our growing community in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium and beyond.<br>• Write case study articles for our blogs.<br>• Do what it takes to get original articles on getting things done with RiteKit in major news sites and top-tier blogs.<br>• Learn how to win at marketing</p><p>Terms &amp; Requirements:<br>• Ability to learn and teach RiteKit products and coach a business owner to use them so that they get social ROI. This will be your entry exam and how you will qualify for the internship.<br>• Ability to collaborate in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>• Commitment: 6 months at 3-5 hours/week OR 12 months at 2~3 hours/week (decide later, no rush)<br>• Be okay with the internship being UNPAID. <br>• Must be well-written and have proven ability to create visual content<br>• No relocation needed; we work remotely</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers. </p><p>As a self funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends that have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time.</p></div>",

We are a skills-based hiring platform that helps companies evaluate technical skills, better. We’re driving a new paradigm shift by eliminating resumes and creating opportunities for hundreds of thousands of programmers worldwide. We have a community of 3.5M developers and 1,000 customers across industries, and the best part is we are just getting started. Our customers – &nbsp;including VMware, Twitter, Capital One, and many other Fortune 100 companies – rely on HackerRank to build strong engineering teams.</p><p>We’ve assembled an amazing team that’s passionate about creating more opportunities for people by changing the way companies hire. We showcase extreme ownership and are data-driven&nbsp;, and we love delighting customers. If you’re interested in scaling HackerRank by working with some of the largest companies in the world, let’s talk.</p><a href='https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker' rel='nofollow'>givers</a><p>HackerRank is hiring a leader to build a system for creating Computer Science challenges. Our mission at HackerRank is to match every developer to the right job, with the underlying driver being skill vs resumes. We are doing millions of developer assessments every quarter with customers across different industries from the internet, banking, retail, to automobile, that are using us for their entire technical recruiting process. What this means is, we are building an interesting data asset on the DNA for a {job role, company} and the DNA for a developer that helps us recommend the right jobs. We are consistently evolving every year to make the matching algorithm better.</p><p>One of the important parts of the matching algorithm is designing the right CS challenge that is both high quality &amp; relevant to the job role that’s being assessed. The CS challenges (referred to as content going forward) is a core part of HackerRank. It helps us assess the skills of a developer in different areas.</p><p>We are looking for a leader who’s passionate about solving the problem of matching developers to the right job and has a developer mindset ready to build this.</p><p></p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL LOVE TO DO…</strong><p>You will manage &amp; lead all content engineering efforts on HackerRank. This includes:</p><p>This involves building the overall strategy of what types of CS challenges should be built? taxonomy, type of challenges, the timeline to ship &amp; owning the entire process end-to-end. Some of the strategies might change due to external market demands.</p><strong></strong><u>Content strategy:</u><u>&nbsp;</u><p>: Moving from the Encarta model (generating a small number of challenges from a small set of experts) to Wikipedia model (generating a large number of challenges from the 3m+ developer community). Building this will come with its own challenges of ensuring we can retain quality and the right incentives at scale. This would involve building the right framework to manage the hundreds/thousands of challenge contributors and also managing a small team of curators</p><strong></strong><u>Building a system of crowdsourced generation of challenges</u><p>&nbsp;There’s a difference between Quora answers vs Y! answers. Ensuring we have the right quality framework (for e.g. grammatically correct, crisp problem statements, relevant to the job role, code stubs present to make it easy for developers to get started, etc.) and continuously improving for all challenges is important. HackerRank challenges should be synonymous with HQ CS challenges.</p><strong></strong><u>Quality control:</u><p></p><strong>GET EXCITED. Because you’re about to have a huge impact.</strong><p>HackerRank is growing fast and we’re having a great time working together as we build! We’re a fun, friendly, passionate bunch. We’re a team of teams and we’re looking for more smiling faces to come to join us! The position is full-time and while we would want this person to be ideally in Bangalore or Palo Alto, for the right person, a remote position is OK too</p><div> <div><div><p> <br><br> <b>To apply for this job please visit the URL below.</b> <br><br> Please reference <b>Jobspresso</b> in your job application, so that remote companies know where their best candidates are coming from  <br><br> <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/hackerrank/jobs/1110018' rel='nofollow'>https://boards.greenhouse.io/hackerrank/jobs/1110018 →</a></p></div></div></div>",

    "content": "JOB TYPE: Part Time<br /><br />EXPERIENCE: beginner<br /><br />COMPANY: Invalley; 1-10 employees; 50-75% remote;<br /><br />Invalley is offering an exciting job opportunity for a new campaign manager to join our super-talented and friendly team. The right candidate will have the opportunity to work remotely from anywhere in the world, with a fully flexible schedule and plenty of room for professional development.<br /><br />If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, read on for all the details.<br /><br />Who Are We and What Do We Do?<br /><br />Let us start by introducing ourselves. We’re an SEO company based in Nijmegen, the Netherlands (the oldest city in our country) which provides innovative link-building campaigns for customers all across the world. For over 8 years, we’ve been helping all types of clients - from small digital agencies to large fortune 500 media companies - to improve their ranking in the SERPs through our website invalley.com.<br /><br />What Will You Do?<br /><br />As a campaign manager, you’ll be responsible for ensuring that our link-building campaigns are carried out perfectly. To do this, you’ll manage a team of high-quality link builders and content writers as they create and distribute the content. Once the campaign is complete, you’ll also send the final report to the client. <br /><br />There are 5 key tasks that our campaign managers need to complete: <br /><br />●    Planning/Outsourcing: using our collaboration tool Monday.com, you will plan the campaign and ensure that the right content writers and link builders are assigned to the appropriate tasks. <br />●    Team support: you’ll support a team of link builders and content writers, answer any questions they may have, and make sure deadlines are met. <br />●    Quality check: you’ll check whether our team conducts every campaign task correctly.<br />●    Report delivery: you’ll deliver the final report to the client. Most link-building campaigns are delivered within 2 to 4 weeks. <br />●    Customer support: when a customer has questions or feedback, you are the first point of contact. If they require any revisions, you’ll communicate this back to the team. <br /><br />Who is Our Ideal Candidate?<br /><br />●    You have strong communication skills. You’ll need this as you’re the point of contact for both our customers and our team. You’re someone who enjoys communicating with your social contacts on a daily basis. As you’ll be emailing often, having English as your first language is preferred.<br />●    You have a basic level of knowledge of the fundamentals of SEO. Do you know the difference between different types of anchor texts? And can you talk about off-site optimisation or Domain Authority? If so, we’d love to talk further with you. <br />●    You’re a planning expert. You’re always on top of your schedule and you love to finish tasks on-time. You don’t just have a good overview of your own agenda, you can also keep an overview of a team of people.<br />●    You’re a perfectionist. At Invalley.com, we’re known for our attention to detail - this can be seen in everything we do. You’re the type of person that notices when a piece of content uses 3 different types of fonts or doesn’t contain any capital letters and changes it.<br />●    You’re familiar with using applications like Google Drive, Gmail, Google Sheets and Google Docs. You have good technical skills and can quickly adapt to new tools such as Monday.com.<br />●    You are a trustworthy, assertive and responsible person with a strong work ethic and a passion for great customer service.<br /><br />What Do We Offer?<br /><br />●    An awesome opportunity to work from anywhere in the world!<br />●    A fully flexible schedule - you can work whenever you choose to.<br />●    A position in which you have high responsibilities and plenty of opportunities for professional growth.<br />●    On-the-job training. We will first teach you how to handle the Quality Checks and Report Delivery tasks, which will take approximately 10 hours per week. <br />●    If all goes well, you’ll start working on all 5 management tasks and gradually transition into a full-time role (40 hours per week).<br />●    Weekly payments through PayPal",

We host the Wikimedia projects, build software experiences for reading, contributing, and sharing Wikimedia content, support the volunteer communities and partners who make Wikimedia possible, and advocate for policies that enable Wikimedia and free knowledge to thrive. The Wikimedia Foundation is a charitable, not-for-profit organization that relies on donations.

    "content": "At Flock we’re having our very own ‘rocketship’ moment, growing faster than we ever imagined. We’re now looking for an experienced, results-driven Growth Marketer to head up our performance marketing efforts.<br /><br />Over the last two years we’ve reinvented insurance from the ground up. And it’s working. Since launching Flock Cover (our pay-as-you-fly drone insurance app) we have on-boarded over 2,000 active users, maintaining exponential growth and delighting our customers in the process. We have embraced experimentation and tested exciting marketing initiatives, growing through a combination of partnerships, word-of-mouth, and online buzz. Now it’s time to take this up a notch. And that’s where you come in...<br /><br />You will be overseeing our paid and unpaid marketing activities, both online and offline.<br /><br />You’ll find and test new channels with a laser focus on our CPA, identifying and re-doubling efforts on whatever works. What would the CPA for Flock be of sponsoring drone conferences? Giving away free flights? Or flying marketing-drones over London? You’ll get to test your assumptions, both working alone, with the entire Flock team, or with our existing multinational partners, to identify and carve out a successful marketing strategy.<br /><br />Key Responsibilities<br /><br />Supercharge the growth of Flock’s user base, focusing on core metrics (such as the number of policies we sell per day).<br />Analyse our reams of existing data to produce genuinely impactful insights.<br />Engage with our customers to understand the areas that we need to improve on.<br />Work with Flock’s data team to identify new usage-based KPIs.<br />Experiment with different marketing channels (online and offline) to discover what strategies work best in our industry.<br />Set up and run highly effective campaigns across all the channels we work with (and others that we might have missed).<br />Generate new marketing and growth ideas, and engage the rest of the team to implement them.<br />Collaborate with our product and tech teams, to identify and spec out new product features that will help Flock grow faster and retain users more reliably.<br />Your first 30 days<br /><br />We imagine your first month will look something like this:<br /><br />Comprehensive onboarding to the industry, our customers and our product with the help of the whole Flock team<br />Map out Flock’s existing marketing and growth efforts, and resulting attribution<br />Deep-dive into Flock’s acquisition funnel, identifying missed opportunities and easy wins<br />Develop and execute on five growth experiments with the support of our product and marketing teams<br /><br />You should apply if some (or all) of the following are true:<br /><br />You’ve got demonstrable experience exponentially growing the user base and sales of a new product.<br />You are data-driven, always looking to understand the numbers behind everything you do.<br />You enjoy working in teams, but can also work well on your own, and you’re happy to get your hands dirty.<br />You are an excellent communicator, and enjoy the challenge of making the complex seem simple.<br />You’re more than able to multitask and adapt quickly to new situations.<br />You’re happy to take ownership of a task from end to end.<br />You have experience across a range of online and offline platforms (search, social, direct mail, email, etc.)<br />You have a wealth of experience using data-tracking technologies.<br />You have set-up and run successful digital ad campaigns.<br /><br />Our Process<br /><br />Apply on this page. Please explain (briefly) why you’re interested in this position and why you believe you’re the right person for this job, providing examples of your past achievements (if possible).<br />We will schedule you in for an initial 10-minute phone conversation with Antton (Product Lead and founder).<br />We will send over a short exercise for you to complete. This will test a range of skills, from technical to creative. No right or wrong answers here; we’re more interested in understanding your approach.<br />You will be invited for an engaging on-site interview where you will present your exercise answers to various members of the team, including Antton, and Ed (CEO).<br />Meet the entire team in a very casual setting for a friendly chat!<br /><br />Benefits <br /><br />Remuneration<br /><br />Competitive salary<br />Options: we want you to own the work that you do. And this means owning the company you work in. All employees receive options as part of their compensation package.<br />Pension: we offer a full auto-enrollment workplace pension for all employees who want it. Nothing fancy here. Just a pension.<br /><br />Work-life balance<br /><br />Large amounts of autonomy and empowerment in your work<br />Holidays: we offer 33 days of holiday per annum, including bank holidays.<br />Flexible working / working from home: we don’t have fixed working hours, some of our team start at 8am, others at 10am. We trust you to establish an effective working pattern that allows you to excel in your role and makes you a great Flock team member.<br /><br />Learning & Development<br /><br />Books, courses and conference budgets for all employees<br />Hackathons: we run a quarterly hackathon which lasts 24 hours. Everyone’s invited to join in.<br />Breakfast club: learn from your colleagues (or teach us something new!)<br /><br />Perks<br /><br />Friday fancy lunches: every Friday the entire Flock teams heads for lunch together. We call it ‘fancy lunch’. But sometimes it’s just at a pub.<br />Quarterly offsite adventures: every quarter the entire team do something crazy together. Like fly a plane to the coast.
