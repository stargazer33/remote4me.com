    "content": "Timeular is looking for a *Remote Growth Marketer* to join our growth team in scaling our user base.<br />(Note: this role is 100% remote, you can be based anywhere).<br /><br />We’re looking for someone who treats acquisition as part of the core user experience and therefore is eager to dive deep to find out what our users really need so you can tune every piece of the acquisition and create a smooth and engaging experience starting already from the first touch point.<br /><br />Timeular enables people to improve their time management to create more value for themselves and the people around them. Basically, it’s about helping people to focus on the right things, getting rid of distractions and ultimately create more value in fewer hours, which they hopefully will use to enjoy their life outside of work.<br /><br />As we live what we pray we will not ask you to work a crazy amount of hours. In fact, we try hard to protect your time. In return, we ask you to do your best job every day every 40 hour week.<br /><br />We are a fully remote team of 16 people working from 5 countries and are between 20 and 40 years old. You can work whenever you want but we’re accepting applications only from people living in a timezone somewhere starting from GMT-4 till GMT+2 (GMT-5 till GMT+1 in winter northern hemisphere).<br /><br />*ABOUT THIS ROLE*<br /><br />You’ll be responsible to establish new growth loops and improve current ones to scale our Timeular user base in a sustainable and predictable way. While this is a very broad definition of your long-term goal, here is what you can start with until you have enough insights to come up with your own roadmap.<br /><br />*Improve acquisition conversion rates*<br /><br />* Dive into our Google Analytics and Mixpanel data together with the retention team to understand even better which customer-behaviour we provide the most value for and where are touchpoints we could acquire more of them.<br />* Find, prioritize and run experiments to test your hypothesis for how to improve conversion rates and analyze the outcome. Mainly on our paid ads and on the webshop.<br />* Facebook and Google Ads are currently our main acquisition channels. Support your colleagues in creating more efficient creatives and landing pages or to automate spending.<br /><br />*Align our messaging and content*<br /><br />* We aim to increase our traffic through helpful content that’s worth to be shared. Help us to build and tune a scalable content growth loop.<br />* Find the sweet spot between our users’ voice and our values and make sure all our customer facing communication aligns with that.<br />* We didn’t really invest in SEO so far. If you have strong experience there, it’s all yours and ready to go in order to increase our organic traffic.<br /><br />*Lead people*<br /><br />* Identify and prioritize the biggest issues we should focus our resources next.<br />* Manage the implementation and iteration for solutions you come up with. Write and specify tickets and approve the implementations for release.<br />* Help to find and onboard new people so they can do their best work and support them when they need orientation.<br /><br />We know you can’t perform at your best from day one because everything is new and there is a lot of information to absorb first. That’s why you’ll get assigned an onboarding buddy right after joining Timeular to assist you while getting started with your new challenges and all the questions you might have along the way.<br /><br />*ABOUT YOU AND OUR CULTURE*<br /><br />As we work remotely, we communicate a lot in written form. To help you demonstrate the strong writing skills you’ll need for this role, we’ve made the first part of this application process a written task.<br /><br />We believe that the most time efficient communication style, whether it’s client-facing or with your team members, is to be direct but respectful. We’re honest and transparent to each other and we support each other. So should you.<br /><br />We work in cycles. We prioritize our top challenges and pitch solutions in a two week pre-cycle and then focus on getting the most promising solutions out within 6 weeks in mixed teams that change at every cycle.<br /><br />We are a virtual team, meaning there is physically no-one around you and you should feel comfortable working like this most of the time. While we do a lot to bring people together it’s unavoidable that loneliness and de-motivation might hit you here and there. We have all been through this and have learned a few things.<br /><br />We respect time because time is the most valuable thing we have: we show up, deliver and communicate in time. We respect everyone’s private time unless there is a real urgency.<br /><br />We say no to distractions and focus on the important things. We seek the minimal path with the highest possible output. We single task our way along that path. We keep meetings efficient. Basically, we focus on focus.<br /><br />*ABOUT THE PAY AND BENEFITS*<br /><br />We’re still at the beginning of our journey and therefore can’t afford to pay huge salaries; however we manage that with other benefits, which are mostly about helping you to live a healthy life outside of work.<br /><br />The transparent salary for this role at hiring ranges between $40,000 and $80,000, depending on several factors like the country you’re in (taxes, living costs etc…) and your experience. After one year of working full-time at Timeular you can participate in the employee stock option pool.<br /><br />The benefits we offer are:<br /><br />* Work where, when and how you want as long it is in GMT-4 to GMT+2 (GMT-5 till GMT+1 in winter northern hemisphere).<br />* 50 days of paid holidays (including national holidays) because we’ve learned that time off is the best source for great ideas.<br />* Three paid team retreats per year to spend an incredible time together discovering unique locations and amazing food. All costs covered.<br />* Paid parental leave and a couple more benefits<br /><br />*HOW THE APPLICATION PROCESS WORKS*<br /><br />We care about who you are today, what you have achieved so far and where do you want to go.<br /><br />Our application process is pretty simple: we start with asking you a few questions in written form, you answer them the best you can, we read it and, if we like it, we jump on a call to get to know each other better. If that goes well, we do a test period so we both can verify our expectations and if we both agree, you’re in.<br /><br />As we value good clear writing skills, take your time to send your application. When you see a question with Why, dig deep to find the real root-why before answering. We value if you answer with facts and numbers.<br /><br />When we ask for example tasks, write your reply like you would think aloud: imagine you’re doing the task and walk us through your thinking from the starting point until the outcome.<br /><br />*MAKE YOUR TIME COUNT WITH US AND APPLY*<br /><br />If you made it this far, then we assume you’re interested and are likely a good fit. Please apply and we will send you a form to fill in.<br /><br />As we always get many applications it might take some time till we get back to you after having evaluated all the applications.",

Cash remuneration between £60 - 75k with a total package value exceeding £100k.\n<br>\n<br>About the job\n<br>\n<br>We are looking for an exceptional COO to drive operational excellence and growth. This is a rare opportunity to enter a senior position at a funded start-up, established 4 years ago that is now entering scale-up phase.\n<br>\n<br>Reporting to the CEO, the COO will take charge of the Operations, Finance, Talent and People functions. They will also act as a bridge, coordinating people across the company. Initial responsibility will be for 7 staff (3 of which are direct reports) within these functional areas.\n<br>\n<br>Our mission\n<br>\n<br>At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper. One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. \n<br>\n<br>This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it. We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.\n<br>\n<br>Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.\n<br>\n<br>Our Journey\n<br>\n<br>We may be only four years old, but it’s already been quite a ride. We are already working with 45 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 250% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact. We are a team of 25 passionate and ambitious people driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords.\n<br>\n<br>We are looking for an outstanding individual to join our senior leadership team. Your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.\n<br>\n<br>Your responsibilities\n<br>\n<br>As COO, you will drive our business operations to deliver against our ambitious expansion goals by planning and coordinating activities between key teams. You will be responsible for instilling and developing a culture of operating excellence and fostering an aligned, focused and productive environment within the company. You will anticipate operational issues and resolve them proactively before they arise.\n<br>\n<br>Your direct areas of responsibility include, but are not limited to:\n<br>\n<br>• Running the finance department and managing our financial controller.\n<br>\n<br>• Overseeing the operations team including supply chain, manufacturing, customer support and installer support.\n<br>\n<br>• Managing our Head of Talent and Workspace, assisting in getting great people into the business and maintaining our excellent culture.\n<br>\n<br>• Contributing to company strategy, sitting on the senior leadership team.\n<br>\n<br>• Helping the founders execute on fundraising.\n<br>\n<br>• Positioning the company for scale through developing and sharing best practices.\n<br>\n<br>• Attending certain board meetings in an observer capacity.\n<br>\n<br>We are a company built on a strong technical foundation. You’ll need to grasp and communicate a technical solution with staff and external stakeholders.\n<br>\n<br>Your experience\n<br>\n<br>We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:\n<br>\n<br>• A financial pedigree (e.g. MBA, ex CEO/CFO, finance sector / fundraising experience etc)\n<br>\n<br>• Ability to run a finance function that includes planning and fundraising\n<br>\n<br>• A proven track record of leading and scaling high growth organisations\n<br>\n<br>• Experience in designing and improving management reporting processes\n<br>\n<br>• Open-mindedness and ability to improve in response to constructive feedback\n<br>\n<br>• Ability to work horizontally across multiple functional groups\n<br>\n<br>• Strong leadership capabilities and aspiration for excellence\n<br>\n<br>• Proven capabilities in growing talent and teams\n<br>\n<br>• Experience coaching team members, including leaders of teams\n<br>\n<br>• Ability to communicate with credibility and gravitas both internally and externally\n<br>\n<br>• An excellent academic record\n<br>\n<br>• Knowledge of the housing sector is a bonus but not required.\n<br>\n<br>About You\n<br>\n<br>We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:\n<br>\n<br>• You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.\n<br>\n<br>• You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market\n<br>\n<br>• You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems\n<br>\n<br>• You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them. \n<br>\n<br>• You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.\n<br>\n<br>• You’re open, positive &amp; straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.\n<br>\n<br>• You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.\n<br>\n<br>You can expect…\n<br>\n<br>We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family.\n<br>\n<br>We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues. We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location. This year we took the whole team to Spain.\n<br>\n<br>If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company. Cash remuneration between £60-75k with a total package value exceeding £100k.\n<br>\n<br>Interview Timetable\n<br>Applications open: 25th July\n<br>Interviews: W/C 26th August\n<br>Appointment: Before 15th September",

We use data from 11 fixed passive sensors placed around an individual’s home and a wearable device. Each sensor picks up a key activity such as toilet usage, sleep patterns, heart-rate and drinking / eating habits (approximately 5,000 data points). This is where our AI kicks in. Our machines learn a personalised weighting model that can alert to indicators of dehydration, malnutrition, declining mobility/ independence and onset of poor physical or mental health. \n<br>We sell B2B. Our customers are Councils, Retirement Communities, Housing Associations and Care Providers. The alert notifications and corresponding datasets are shown via a dashboard so they can effectively manage emerging care needs before they escalate. The end user can also nominate carer’s or family to receive notifications via an app.\n<br>We’re different because our AI isn’t an after-thought, it’s what has driven us for the start. We collect action-based data and our data scientists and clinical researchers build and refine our algorithms in house. We’re Web 3.0 ready, end users own their own data and can share it with whomever they choose. \n<br>\n<br>Check us out:\n<br>&quot;Website&quot;:https://www.mysense.ai\n<br>&quot;LinkedIn&quot;:https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense\n<br>\n<br>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.",

With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry in sales automation—helping companies to close more deals, faster than ever. Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a fully profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 34 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We are seeking a Product Marketing Manager that will be instrumental in defining our product and market positioning and will take ownership of growing our customer base and platform adoption through a wide range of marketing efforts.&nbsp;</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  This position requires a highly motivated individual with previous experience leading product marketing and GTM strategy, and who is comfortable in a fast-moving&nbsp; environment. The successful candidate will be customer-oriented, self-motivated and results-driven. \n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>About You</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You have a knack for understanding people. You ask a lot of questions. You’re decisive.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  As Product Marketing Manager at Close, your primary job is to understand our customer— what motivates them, what makes their job difficult, and what simply delights them. You will take these constant and ongoing learnings and deftly apply them to the way we position our brand and product to the world. After all, product marketing is at its very core, “people marketing”.&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Your previous experience creating successful go-to-market plans (from high-level strategy down to tactical execution) will enable you to oversee the rollout of all new products and feature updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Sometimes you’ll be looking at our product marketing from a high level view—say, determining our key objectives for the quarter or the year. Other days, you may be down in the weeds yourself, writing landing page copy or working with others on the marketing team to run A/B conversion tests on site. You’re comfortable—and happy—doing both.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  What you don’t know, you’ll openly admit, but then you’ll get to work figuring it out (asking others for help and/or digging deep on your own). Your self-motivation and a relentless drive to learn/do more are appreciated by all. You pride yourself on being a “clever thinker”.&nbsp; You’re comfortable talking with and working alongside our product, sales, development, and customer success teams. You understand your critical part in the overall machine, graciously accepting thoughts and feedback from others while offering your own expertise where you can.

You also have a knack for writing intelligent, witty copy; you probably take photos in your free time, dabble with Lightroom, and your IG game is beyond strong. \n  <br> \n  <br>**About us:** \n  <br> \n  <br>Drops’ goal is to turn language learning into a delightful, effective game. Our primary app, Drops, has been in the App Store for over 3 years, teaches 33 languages, and was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times. It was Google’s Best App of 2018. We are a small, passionate remote team mainly spread across Europe, with a small outpost in California. We mostly work synchronously, so working hour overlap does matter for us. The company is still run by the founders. We communicate via Slack, Git, and Trello. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 14 million, a monthly active of &gt;1,500,000 and an average store rating of 4.7. \n  <br> \n  <br>You can find us here: http://drops.app.link/ \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br># Responsibilities \n  <br> **You will:** \n  <br> \n  <br>Be responsible for all social media, with major emphasis on Instagram. \n  <br>Edit all content, as well as writing a good bit of it. \n  <br>Make all content written by another team member sound almost as witty and brilliant as your own. \n  <br>Develop and pitch creative campaigns with indisputable success metrics. \n  <br>Ideate and collaborate with our product and marketing teams on all projects that involve social media or content marketing, and any other projects you find interesting. \n  <br>Persuade our product developers and marketing team to integrate social media. \n  <br>Strike envy in the hearts and minds of the social media managers of our competitors. \n  <br>You will work with our legal advisor to execute influencer contracts. \n  <br>Strike envy in the hearts of the social media managers of our competitors. \n  <br> \n  <br># Requirements \n  <br>**You have:** \n  <br> \n  <br>* A proven social media and content management track record - including executed, impactful creative campaigns. \n  <br>* Strong verbal and written communication skills in English and the ability to work well cross-functionally. \n  <br>* You are native in these softwares: G-suite (docs, spreadsheet, etc), Slack, Trello, Planoly, Excel/Numbers, Words/Pages, Adobe Creative Suite \n  <br>* Project management experience (everyone is managing projects at Drops) \n  <br> \n  <br>**Our Ideal Candidate:** \n  <br> \n  <br>* You live in Europe, or within the GMT time zone + or - 2 hours. \n  <br>* You speak and write native English. \n  <br>* You’re a social media maven. You have undeniable examples of how you elevated your brand—or the brand of a company—via creative social media engagement--especially through Instagram \n  <br>* You’re sufficiently well spoken—and well written—in long-form and social media lingo. Your editing skills are as good or better than your writing skills. \n  <br>* You hate useless punctuation, but love full stops., \n  <br>* You detest inconsistent capitalization You know that true em dashes are always better than --. \n  <br>* You love finding the perfect post or campaign that sparks a fire. \n  <br>* You love tracking and measuring just how intense that fires gets. \n  <br>* You don’t just know and use best social media best practices but blaze trail with never-been-seen ideas. \n  <br>* You can make that fire spark another. Maybe you’re not a maven. Maybe you’re a social pyromaniac. \n  <br>* You stalk the most unapproachable of influencers and can negotiate anything for a free license. \n  <br>* You’re a perfectionist re: all media you use--prefer creating your own visual assets, but can cost-efficiently manage in-house or outsourced designers for the bigger stuff. \n  <br>* You love proving - preferably with numbers - to engineers that social media and content do matter. In acquisitions, in retention, in $. \n  <br>* You love language learning, whether you’re good at it or not. At the very least, you’re willing to obsess over what makes language learners tick. \n  <br>* We’re building a small, but super capable team. You’re naturally more interested in the fate of the product &amp; driven to grow professionally, than in managing people. \n  <br>* We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary. \n  <br>* We value clear and honest communication and transparency - it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success, and freedom. You will be involved in both high and low level decision making, and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT). \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>#Location \n  <br>- EU-only \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

(Hourly rate TBC)\n<br>Benefits: - \n<br>\n<br>__Mission for role__\n<br>*To head up all aspects of marketing for Eco Companion, focusing in particular on specific KPIs that matter to the business - most importantly increasing sales made through our new booking engine!*\n<br>\n<br>We’re now looking for a new marketing manager to come in to take charge of all aspects of our marketing efforts! We have already made great progress, in particular with social media where we now have a following of over 150,000 on our own network and also a community of content creators called Eco Companion Journalists we work with. We also have a good starting point of a mailing list to be built on. You will have free reign to work alongside me (Max the founder) in particular to work on driving more people down the funnel towards ultimately making a booking through the Eco Companion website.\n<br>\n<br>Eco Companion is now over 4 years old and has pivoted now into a tailor made eco tourism tour operator. So we’re building a higher end experience for people looking to travel to the natural world in a way that sincerely does improve the world! \n<br>\n<br>We are barely yet making bookings as we’ve focused on developing the core experience delivered through our website. This work is largely done now though and so we’re eager to push the marketing and advertising. Though with a very small budget initially.\n<br>\n<br>We represent high risk as you will be working for a startup that’s only just gone professional. So don’t expect big pay cheques straight away (and if you’re just in it for the cash then this isn’t the role for you). However, what you will find whilst working for Eco Companion is a much faster rate of growth for you as a person than you could ever hope to achieve within a larger corporate enterprise.\n<br>\n<br>Eco Companion has a big goal: to become a global leader in travel and change the world for the better along the way through delivering the highest standards in sustainability and ecotourism! If this gets you pumped and excited then this could be the family for you!\n<br>\n<br>Read more about us here: https://www.ecocompanion.com/about_us\n<br>Read more about our world rating system here: https://www.ecocompanion.com/world_rating_system \n<br>\n<br>__Outcomes__\n<br>Build our business based around our KPIs. In particular driving overall bookings through the site. We’re currently still burning cash each month so are in the process of trying to cut away at that through delivering more and more sales (selling holidays).\n<br>Manage our content marketing strategy using our content calendar.\n<br>Manage all of our social networks including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.\n<br>Manage our ever-growing email mailing list.\n<br>Conduct regular user research to develop the website, our product, to become more and more effective. \n<br>\n<br>__Role-based Competencies__\n<br>Scientific mind. Constantly look to be creating tests and analysing results to deliver sustainable continuous improvement.\n<br>Salesman in copy. Be able to write to directly appeal to a specific audience, in order to generate sales for each ad you create or interaction you have with our audience.\n<br>Organisation.

For us, this means rethinking what it takes to design, build and launch the next generation of digital health products and services—whether their goal is improving patient care, treatment compliance, clinical diagnostics or surgical precision—these are serious challenges, and they need seriously good solutions.</p>\n <p>More than a consultancy, we’re also an in-house product team—we are effectively building and launching new startup propositions for our clients and ourselves. To do this we need an amazing team of designers, engineers, strategists, and roles we haven’t even created yet.</p>\n <p>We don’t work like an agency, or a consultancy, or even a product studio. We work with our clients as if we were part of their team. We join them in the trenches. We treat the unseen aspects of their product as if they were on full display. We go above and beyond the brief to maximise the impact and success they have on the market and the users they serve.</p>\n <p>To live up to this, everyone in our team relentlessly drives towards the same goal—to improve the health and wellbeing of people all over the world.</p>\n <p>If that lights a fire in your belly, come on board.</p>\n <p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></p>\n <p>You’ll be the custodian of everything the user touches—defending their interests and needs (to the death) and solving serious design challenges with elegant, intuitive and, if needs be, unconventional solutions, with a touch of personal flair. In practical terms, you’ll be working on greenfield projects, collaborating closely with UX directors, art directors and the best engineers, strategists and “tier 1” clients to create engaging user experiences; building prototypes, designing beautiful and polished interfaces, leading other designers, and helping ensure smooth handovers.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You use design best practices that work – You have great taste in interfaces. You keep abreast of what works and what doesn’t as our medium continues to evolve. You can instantly recognise the tools and methods required to achieve results in any given situation.</li>\n  <li>You can work fast, and slow – Having worked in both fast-paced start-up environments and more process-driven corporate settings, you understand how to balance lean design principles with corporate governance and signoff processes.</li>\n  <li>You’re willing and able to go beyond the conventional – Digital products can lack personality, style and risk-taking. We never compromise accessibility or performance but we do push the creative boundaries of what’s possible to create unique, engaging experiences. You’re not only comfortable with this but crave the opportunity to create original concepts and new UI systems.</li>\n  <li>You’ve found balance – You know how to balance a product’s design with what your peers would applaud and what your client and their users really need. You know when to strive for pixel perfect, when good is good enough, and when polished interactions and animations serve a purpose, and when they are simply a pursuit of vanity.</li>\n  <li>You have a sharp eye for detail – You have highly developed organisational skills and the ability to prioritise tasks. You strive for quality not only in your final deliverables but also in the working assets you use along the way.</li>\n  <li>You over-communicate with the team about your priorities, choices, tradeoffs, and the rationale behind the design decisions you take.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>You’ll have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Several years experience in product design with experience leading other designers</li>\n  <li>A portfolio of projects that you can talk us through: the end result, the process you took, trade-offs you had to make, the inspiration and design systems you used</li>\n  <li>A deep understanding and appreciation of the various design systems and guidelines that dominate app and web interfaces, and where and when they should be used</li>\n  <li>Strong UX capabilities: you’re able to interrogate and understand a product’s users and commercial goals and make sure our work drives towards these</li>\n  <li>Expert UI skills: you have a rich understanding of UI principles and can apply these to polished, interactive designs</li>\n  <li>A proactive mindset: if there’s something you don’t understand, or a task/process tweak that’s needed, you seek to address it rather than relying on others to</li>\n  <li>Fluency in spoken and written English: accents are fine, but we work on tricky projects across multiple time zones so great communication is a must</li>\n  <li><strong>Willingness to get overlap with the team: they’ll be on a European time zone, so you’ll need to arrange for at least 4 hours of overlap each day</strong></li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Bonus if you also have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Experience doing all of the above 100% remotely!</strong></li>\n  <li>Achieved mastery of; type hierarchies, interaction language, intuitive navigation, modality, card-based component design, and data visualisation</li>\n  <li>Knowledge and experience of designing products for patients and clinicians</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://hanno.co/careers/senior-product-designer/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

We provide smart solutions centred around protection and functionality that hold design and craft at their core. We’ve grown from a guerrilla crowdfunding campaign to an internationally recognised brand, shipping to almost every country in the world. We’ve made it our mission to disrupt the saturated lifestyle accessory market, whilst constantly pushing the boundaries of what it means to be an engaging brand. We knew that in order to achieve this, our products needed to be three things: stylish, functional and protective.

Since then, we have rapidly developed and expanded our product range, offering a multitude of cases with an array of add-ons!

Our products enable businesses to understand their customers, find future prospects, and personalize how they communicate.</p>\n <p>Today, Clearbit powers more than 1,500 enterprise customers and 500,000 individual marketers, engineers, and sales reps. It’s an exciting time to join Clearbit. We’re a profitable, rapidly growing SaaS company (&gt; 100% ARR last year), full of can-do people who care about craft, collaboration, and our customers.</p>\n <p>We’re looking for a creative marketer and sharp writer to help Clearbit communicate value to its customers, prospects, and the world — from developing Clearbit company and product narratives to providing resources for helping busy marketing and sales teams thrive in their jobs.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Role</strong><br>As a Lifecycle Content Marketer, you’ll work closely with our Head of Content and be part of our scrappy growth team. The team works across 5 realms — conversion, analytics, demand, product marketing, and content — which led to the idea that we’re like a Captain Planet team, with different expertise areas coming together to create great work. Content is Earth — creating foundational resources to help us grow. (If you’re interested in this team, you hopefully enjoy a little metaphor.)</p>\n <p>Content at Clearbit is not driven by eyeballs, which is, let’s face it, a little gross. We want to connect with the brains and emotions of actual, whole people — to educate and inspire, make them go “aha!” and go think and work on something they read about. To do so, you’ll be writing and creating collateral around how to use data to do better sales and marketing.</p>\n <p><strong>Here’s an idea for some of the things you’ll be doing:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Create useful content that will help Clearbit become a go-to resource for our target communities and customers.</strong> You’ll create blog posts, email copy, and other collateral — as well as experiment with different formats and mediums — to help inform, encourage, and market to customers across different stages of their lifecycle. This might involve managing and editing contributions from other employees, freelancers, partners, and community members.</li>\n  <li><strong>Drive distribution, according to team and company goals:</strong> Part of the job of creating content is telling people that it exists. Otherwise, it’s the whole tree falling in the forest thing. Promotion and distribution tasks may include creating newsletters, using social media, or coming up with experiment ideas.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep us on message: </strong>You’ll pitch in to wordsmith marketing copy and review content for clarity and brand consistency, style, tone, and voice across the company. For instance, you might be pulled in to provide feedback on a survey or to copy edit a presentation. Writing is hard! And you’ll be one of our resident experts.</li>\n  <li><strong>Help us learn and grow through reporting and analysis. </strong>Again, content here isn’t driven by vanity metrics but we are informed by data to understand how we’re doing and how we can improve. Our content (and overall growth team) strategies are always rooted in specific business and quarterly goals — so it’s good to know the health of how we’re doing. Currently we use tools like Google Analytics, Mode, and Tableau — have support from a super analytics team.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What will you bring to the table?</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>You’re an excellent writer and editor. </strong>You can explain complex concepts clearly, tell a compelling story, and write with personality. You think editing is integral to the writing process.</li>\n  <li><strong>You have a history of marketing or editorial success. </strong>Ideally you experienced some of that success working for a SaaS or media company. We’re looking for someone who can show how they’ve had a direct hand in building an audience, helping customers succeed, teaching and educating, and/or moving hearts, minds, (and wallets).</li>\n  <li><strong>Your content is deliberate</strong> — driven by an understanding of why it’s being created and who it serves. You’re opinionated when it comes to making decisions about what makes content interesting or helpful — and how it fits in strategically. You’re a believer in talking with and knowing your audience.</li>\n  <li><strong>You’re curious and quick to learn</strong>, and you love to do so through the writing process. We’re not necessarily looking for someone to come in the door with domain expertise, but you’re eager to dive in, talk to people, do research, and then share what you’ve learned. You like to ask questions like “why?” and “what if?” and follow through to find the answers.</li>\n  <li><strong>You thrive when able to self-direct.</strong> You’re looking to work with a startup where you’ll be responsible for the impact you make and have a lot of freedom. The growth team is fully remote, so you work well with autonomy and are a proactive communicator.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>When applying, please include:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose)</li>\n  <li>Links to a portfolio or at least 3 writing samples</li>\n  <li>This <em>is</em> a content position — a great cover letter will help you make your case</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/clearbit/28d77eba-55a0-4dd0-b256-7a3c2853945c' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

    "content": "What's the opportunity?\n<br>-----------------------\n<br>We're looking for an experienced Product Designer to help us support the way businesses, do business. You will be joining a very product focused team and will own design throughout the product development cycle - from new ideas all the way to implementations. If you’re passionate about the craft and process of building an exciting product from the ground up and working with great people, you’ll fit right in.\n<br>\n<br>Who are we?\n<br>-------------\n<br>CreditDigital allows vendors to provide an instant finance option to their business customers at online checkout or point-of-sale. Business customers can then design their own terms to fit their budget and cashflow. We are trying to solve a massive problem in the B2B world and we are very excited to be amongst the first ones tackling it.\n<br>\n<br>What will you be doing?\n<br>------------------------\n<br>As the first designer in the company, you will have the opportunity to set up the standards in how the design process works. As a product team, we trust each individual to be autonomous and work towards are shared goals. We are fully committed in supporting one another in any way possible.\n<br>\n<br>* Act as a champion that drives product ideas from start to completion: from research insights, to workflows all the way to visual designs.\n<br>* Sketch and prototype ideas to quickly access viability, and design the fine grained details of interactions.\n<br>* Iterate based on feedback from the whole team.\n<br>* Work closely with engineers as they build and ship ideas.\n<br>\n<br>What skills and experience do I need?\n<br>------------------------------------\n<br>We are looking for product designers that have done this before. You will be designer #1 which is very exciting and you will get to set the tone of our product.\n<br>\n<br>* Experience designing digital products and systems (styleguides), not just websites. You have helped ship products.\n<br>* An appreciation of the entire product development process, from problem solving through to detailed UI and visual design.\n<br>* The ability to create mockups of your designs.\n<br>* Excellent communicator that can articulate the thought behind proposals.\n<br>* Able to collaborate with the engineers and the wider company on strategy and delivery.\n<br>\n<br>Where will I be working from?\n<br>-----------------------------\n<br>Normally you will be working from our Angel offices (right next to the station) but we are a remote friendly bunch so you can adjust your schedule as you see fit.\n<br>\n<br>What would I be paid?\n<br>----------------------\n<br>Our pay is within the top 10% of the industry, for the matched role and experience, based on London rates. According to the market at the moment, we aim to pay £70,000 for the role.\n<br>\n<br>Salary is not everything. Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived away from work. We don't offer free beers or Coke on tap but rather:\n<br>\n<br>* 25 days off per annum plus bank holidays.\n<br>* 35 hours / week. Normal working hours are between 10am – 6pm.\n<br>* Work from home whenever. If you prefer to come to the office everyday that’s great, if you prefer to work from home 4 times a week that’s fantastic. Whatever works for you. As a team we will make sure you are not missing out by pushing remote first practices. Flexibility to adjust your daily hours. Visiting friends and family in another country, going to the bank or the gym, you only need to have an overlap between our core hours (12am – 4pm) for 6 hours. As an example, you can start at 8am and finish at 4pm or 12am and finish at 8pm.\n<br>\n<br>How to apply?\n<br>--------------\n<br>Where you have previously worked does not really matter. If you have a Linkedin profile, just to have a more general idea, send it through, no CV is needed in that case. Instead, send us through a cover letter where you explain more about your experience. We would like you to express:\n<br>\n<br>* What have you worked on that you are the most proud of?\n<br>* What do you enjoy working on the most?\n<br>* How do you approach the design process?\n<br>* What would you like to work on here?\n<br>\n<br>In the interview process we will go through a particular piece of work (your choice) that you have delivered, detailing the approach around it, challenges and learnings. We're looking for a feature/research that clearly outlines the problems you were tackling with your design work. It should touch on the process you applied to tackling the challenges, rather than focusing just on visuals and landing pages. We would like to go through from inception to interactions and the visual design. The work should ideally focus on designing software products.\n<br>\n<br>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company.",

There are people who know about politics and people who know about technology and a few who have figured out some things about how to combine the two, but we are blazing new trails and you should be comfortable exploring and learning from everyone you can.</li>\n<p>This is a full-time role. We are a remote team with a concentration of folks in Washington, D.C., San Francisco Bay Area, Boston and Chicago.

Our first product streamlines recruiting scheduling and coordination, saving teams hundreds of hours a month. We’re just getting started on, and have our sights set on making hiring a great experience for recruiters, hiring managers, and candidates. We’re building the platform to engage these key stakeholders and fix the $200 billion per year hiring industry.</p>\n <p>This is an exceptional opportunity to join a small and fast-growing startup, transforming an industry with powerful and easy to use products customers love. As an early employee you’ll have tons of ownership, a big impact on product, a say in our values, and opportunities to tremendously accelerate your career growth.</p>\n <p>We’re building a remote team and looking for the best individuals – no matter where you are. All we require is a reliable internet connection and passion for building an amazing company.</p>\n <p><strong>What We’re Looking For</strong></p>\n <p>You’re a product designer with a passion for elegant UI / UX. You believe design is more than pixel pushing – it’s a process to create useful, usable, and beautiful products. You have an intuition for elegant designs, but recognize there’s no replacement for user testing. You’re incredibly empathetic and want to build something people want. You may have explored product management and recognize that choosing the right problem to solve is as valuable as designing solutions.</p>\n <p>Building products through the entire design life cycle is where you shine. You’d consider yourself a full stack generalist, comfortable with everything from research to high fidelity mockups. That includes user experience, user interface, interactions, information architecture, sketches, and wireframes. You’ve worked with and know how to be part of an engineering team. Your design process is pragmatic and actionable, helping accelerate development. Building and using a consistent design system excites you.</p>\n <p>As the sole designer on the team, you can also handle graphic design tasks as they arise. That includes branding, helping with marketing materials, and polishing external documents.</p>\n <p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong><br>You’ll be embedded with engineering and work closely with the founders to create delightful products. Starting from a problem our customers face, you’ll work with engineers to design a solution. This will be an iterative process of talking to customers, wire-framing, and working with engineers. As the solution becomes better defined, you’ll provide engineers high fidelity UI mockups.</p>\n <p>In addition to day to day feature development, you’ll play an integral part in defining the product direction and strategy, helping create a cohesive product experience. You’ll also own the UI and brand visual direction.</p>\n <p><strong>What We Value</strong></p>\n <p>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, challenging the status quo, nothing is “not my job”, having empathy, being direct, and being honest.</p>\n <p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Autonomy, impact, and ownership. As an early employee you’ll shape the product direction and company values.</li>\n  <li>Competitive salary and significant equity in a fast growing, early stage startup.</li>\n  <li><strong>Remote employment – work where you want, when you want.</strong></li>\n  <li>Generous vacation policy – take time whenever you need to recharge. Building a lasting company is a marathon, not a sprint.</li>\n  <li>Top-notch healthcare, dental, and vision coverage.</li>\n  <li>Life and disability insurance.</li>\n  <li><strong>Annual company retreat – helps build camaraderie as a remote team.</strong></li>\n  <li>Computer and home office setup – we’ll buy anything you need to do your best work.</li>\n  <li>Continuing education allowance – learn what you want, when you want.</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/interviewschedulecom/view/P_AAAAAAIAAFWBL6Ag_SSxHs' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

We’re searching for a&nbsp;<strong>Paid Advertising Specialist&nbsp;</strong>to help our team solve our clients’ biggest problem. If you’re looking for a position where you can&nbsp;<strong>set your own hours</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>take holidays as you see fit</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>work remotely from home or anywhere in the world</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>help medical research succeed</strong>, then please read on.</p>\n <p>Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but a big part of what’s been achieved is due to new medications, medical devices and understanding developed through clinical research.</p>\n <p><strong>Our clients</strong>&nbsp;academic researchers and medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials.</p>\n <p><strong>Our company</strong>&nbsp;Trialfacts, removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients and volunteers they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</p>\n <p><strong>We’re looking for someone who can:</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Optimize&nbsp;</strong>You’ll be managing our Facebook campaigns from end to end, and expected to continuously run experiments and evaluate new strategies, processes and technologies to continuously improve performance and CPA. You’ll be expected to contribute to ongoing advertising process and systems improvement, to support reliable campaign performance forecasting, efficient campaign setup, and CPA improvement.</p>\n <p><strong>Scale&nbsp;</strong>Very often our clients are under pressure to get volunteers as fast as possible. We need to be able to scale up our Facebook campaigns as and when they need us to, to not only match their demand but keep our CPAs well under control. This won’t always be easy, especially if we have been targeting a specific audience for a number of months. You’ll need to be creative and relentless in your efforts to satisfy our clients’ needs. \\</p>\n <p><strong>Learn</strong>&nbsp;We’re looking for someone who’s driven to constantly update their advertising and optimization knowledge with the latest strategies and techniques. You’ll also need to rapidly develop an in-depth understanding of clinical trials and what it means to advertise for them on paid online channels. Unlike advertising for other products and services, you will be guided by strict ethical codes and guidelines, which at times, will require innovative problem-solving.</p>\n <p><strong>Evolve&nbsp;</strong>We’re a growing business that is keen to increase our presence across popular advertising channels, such as Adwords, Instagram and Youtube. You will work with our Advertising Managers to identify the channels best suited to us and run experiments to quickly grow our expertise in these areas.</p>\n <p><strong>What’s in it for you:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Autonomy</strong>&nbsp;We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a leave application process (you can take paid holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working.</li>\n  <li><strong>Innovation</strong>&nbsp;We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g. our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews, social media recruitment), and we’re constantly improving our service. We have developed a data-driven forecasting approach that provides predictability in a volatile industry. Our consistent, data-driven process has allowed us to be the first and only recruitment company to provide certainty to our clients via a money-back guarantee.</li>\n  <li><strong>Impact</strong>&nbsp;Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clientsresearchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practiceswork hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</li>\n  <li><strong>Growth</strong>&nbsp;– As a member of a small team you’ll be exposed to many areas of the business. You’ll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. You’ll be testing and implementing new marketing strategies. You’ll have access to courses and training programs of your choice, paid for by Trialfacts. Each quarter we’ll put in place a Development Plan to increase your skills, knowledge, experience, and responsibility.</li>\n  <li><strong>Opportunity</strong>&nbsp;– As a small and innovative team we’ve done away with outdated corporate thinking like the physical office, micromanaging and bureaucratic leave processes, but we haven’t thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We offer a stable salary + results-based compensation package, discretionary annual bonuses, annual salary review, a personal and tailored development plan, and the possibility to grow into positions of additional responsibility and leadership in the future. We’re growing rapidly and we’re excited to have someone join the team who will be focusing exclusively on optimization and scaling, and growing our presence on new advertising channels. We’re an innovative company in an industry ripe for disruption. The future looks optimistic as we continue to improve and expand on our core service. We apply the same innovative approach to patient advertising, and are always trying to improve our abilities, whether that’s through using platforms like Adespresso, exploring new channels or trying out different advertising mediums like video advertising.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>This position is for you, if you:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Have Facebook ad experience –&nbsp;</strong>we’re all about learning on the job, however we would prefer someone who has previous experience in running campaigns on Facebook.</li>\n  <li><strong>Are great at synthesizing information</strong>&nbsp;– you’ll be analyzing vast amounts of data across multiple campaigns and funnel stages, so you’ll need to be at home with receiving a high volume of input, honing in on what’s important, and efficiently moving forward.</li>\n  <li><strong>Have a passion for testing and making data-driven decisions</strong>&nbsp;– there’s no doubt advertising requires a love of both data and testing. If you’re not comfortable with gathering, manipulating and interpreting data, and constantly testing everything, then please don’t apply.</li>\n  <li><strong>Love learning</strong>&nbsp;– we’re a team that’s driven by learning and improving. We’re looking for someone who wants to continuously learn and develop as a paid advertising specialist, grow as a person and constantly improve the service that we provide. If you’re not excited about learning and always taking that next course, then this position is not a good fit for you.</li>\n  <li><strong>Are highly organized</strong>&nbsp;– you’ll be managing campaigns for many different clients, while also testing, creating and setting up new campaigns, and always learning more. If you’re not highly organized and comfortable in a fast-paced environment then you’re unlikely a good-fit for this role.</li>\n  <li><strong>Are proficient in HTML &amp; CSS</strong>&nbsp;(any other coding languages are an asset) – Similar to the above, marketing today relies heavily on technology and automation. You don’t need any formal development experience but if you’re not comfortable with at least HTML &amp; CSS, please don’t apply. Similarly, if you’re not the kind of person that loves testing out new tools and technology, this position is not a good fit.</li>\n  <li><strong>Excel at written and spoken English</strong>&nbsp;– Being able to write well is a must for any Trialfacts position. Being in a remote team, you must also be great at communicating and comfortable sharing your thoughts – whether it be in Slack or during a team meeting on Zoom. At times you will even use screen share software (like Loom) to explain a concept or provide feedback.</li>\n  <li><strong>Are results-driven&nbsp;</strong>– you will be coached and guided, but ultimately you will be responsible for your performance which will directly impact your compensation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Are looking for a full-time position</strong>&nbsp;– we’re experiencing growth and we need someone who can fully commit to Trialfacts and get up to speed fairly quickly. We’re not looking for someone who wants to run their own part-time business or freelancing career on the side.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Here’s how to apply:</strong></p>\n <p>If you’re interested in this position, then please email us at&nbsp;<strong>applications@trialfacts.com</strong>&nbsp;with the subject “Paid Advertising Specialist Application – [Your Name]” and tell us why we should consider you. Please also let us know how you heard about this position, and include in your application your current career goals and why you would like this position. Please also address where you think you’ll be located.&nbsp;<strong>Make sure you follow the instructions.</strong></p>\n <p>Please note, you may find the application process differs a little from what you might expect. Although there will be phone interviews, an interview alone is a poor way to assess a candidate, so we’ll also be asking you to complete a few short tasks. These tasks are quick and designed to be fun and informative, but also to assess something about you. After each task we will let you know if you were successful in proceeding to the next round. If all goes well we’ll ask you to undertake a paid trial to see if there is a good fit, before making a final decision.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://trialfacts.com/paid-advertising-specialist' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4><span>What Does Success Look Like?</span></h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll receive extensive on the job training including a customized trail of technical assessments and assignments. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You'll have dedicated pairing time scheduled with various colleagues to cover different skills, and we'll even participate in several mock client meetings so your first standup or sprint planning meeting doesn't carry with it the weight of your first client interaction. After this training period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;\n  <span><em>Welcome aboard!</em></span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>Ongoing Support</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Individual quarterly goal progress</li>\n  <li>Project status / team issues / weekly retro</li>\n  <li>Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire<br><br></li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <span>Quarterly and Annual Reviews</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We're here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4><span>Experience and Results At Every Level</span></h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019.

We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal budgeting apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. Our mission is to help our users take total control of their money—not just by using an app (if only it were that easy!), but changing habits and ways of thinking.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>You’re the one we’re looking for if you’re collaborative, results-oriented, creative, and disciplined. You love solving complex problems both internally and for our users, and know what it means to build a mature, evolving product. You’re customer-centric and have a knack for developing a deep understanding of their needs. You could say the same about understanding the needs a SaaS business like YNAB faces and the larger market landscape, too. You probably organize things in your sleep, and enjoying making sense out of seeming chaos — but you’re also comfortable living in spots where messy is THE place to be. You communicate for a living and you know it, so you understand the language of development and design, marketing and support—and you do it well in all mediums, from face-to-face, to long-form, to comments in a Figma file. You expound on decision-making strategies for too long at summer barbeques, but somehow keep people listening. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</span></h5>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li> You must have at least five years working <b>in the software industry, three of which you've been in the role of a product manager</b>. Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.<br></li>\n  <li><span>You must have experience in cross-functional product development. And we really mean that cross-functional part. </span><br></li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>That’s a super-brief intro to what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h3><span>A Bit About Us</span></h3>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We build YNAB (or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands), the best budgeting software around. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (</span>\n  <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a>\n  <span>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original</span>\n  <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'><span></span><span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a>\n  <span> has to really </span>\n  <em>click</em>\n  <span> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you! </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h3>Who you'd be working with:</h3>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We’re talking product manager here, so you’d be working with a lot of different people. We can’t even list them all, really. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>You’ll be reporting to Todd, our Chief Product Officer. He obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—especially any magic to make YNAB simpler to adopt and more powerful in the long run, too. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence and very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>And as we said above, you’ll also cross paths with--well--probably everyone else. People like Buffy and Sebastian (a couple of our developers), Alan (a designer), and Angela (our Director of Customer Support). Also, our other new product manager, who we haven’t met yet, either.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h3>How You'll Work at YNAB</h3>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>Live Where You Want</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too. &nbsp;Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span>\n  <em>minimum</em>\n  <span> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span>\n  <a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a>\n  <span>, a </span>\n  <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a>\n  <span> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on </span>\n  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'><span>Laguna Beach</span></a>\n  <span>. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>Up Your Game</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, online courses and subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span>\n  <em>and your family.</em>\n  <span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span>\n  <em>your retirement</em>\n  <span></span>\n  <em>nest egg</em>\n  <span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>Other Tidbits</span></h5>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span><br></li>\n  <li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span><br></li>\n  <li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not </span><em>think</em><span> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span><br><br></li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. </span>\n  <span>You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success.</span>\n  <span> You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h3><span>Now, back to you, our new Product Manager...</span></h3>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span><br></span>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>What Success Looks Like: </span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>At YNAB, our goal is for every user to achieve life-changing financial control. No small thing, right? In 2019, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB effortless and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience...Success means you get the best ideas and the best outcomes out of our cross-functional teams, and regularly ship real value to our users. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>You’ll also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users. We’ve been growing. A lot. And that means an evolving product structure—you’ll work closely with Todd, our CPO, and with another new-to-YNAB product manager to continue building that structure out, blending the best of who we are with who we can be. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>You’ll need to:</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <ul>\n  <li><span>Understand the user journey, not just as they use our apps, but in the real world as they seek to take control of their financial lives.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Understand deeply that “cross-functional” isn’t code at YNAB for “designers and engineers.” We’ve doubled down on our best ideas coming from </span><em>anywhere</em><span>, and Support, Marketing, and Education are equal members of our flat product teams. </span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Along those lines, you’ll learn the design principles and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You’ll learn our engineering processes like the back of your </span><em>other</em><span> hand. Then you’ll find </span><em>another</em><span> hand or three for internalizing our brand, marketing strategies and support ethic.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Shepherd your team’s work from discovery to ideation to release to follow-up (because you know how much product work happens </span><em>after </em><span>release), documenting decisions the team has made along the way. In particular, you’ll work hand-in-hand with a product designer on your team to jointly develop vision, prioritize, and execute on strategy.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Synthesize and make sense of ALL THE DATA and information about our products, for yourself and to help others across the organization make better decisions. You’re fluent in quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. </span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Be comfortable with multiple discovery techniques and strategies in your quest to make YNAB consistently better. You enjoy talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing. You have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way to share with teammates. </span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done in writing. Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>You’re intensely curious. Period.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Oh, also, not to the exclusion of anything else, but you’re intensely curious about how people learn, how they change and develop habits, and how behavior inside a product might change behavior outside it.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>You’re comfortable speaking the language of software development and product design. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!), that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement. Conversant across all disciplines is key.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Be a curious, persistent, and a quick learner, staying ahead of new ideas, technologies and other opportunities to help YNAB users take total control of their money, even sleep better at night.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Manage key partner relationships, from day-to-day communication to contract negotiation and management.</span><br></li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>Finally, your success as a product manager at YNAB hinges upon your ability to approach product development as holistic simultaneous problem solving of both user and business goals. We work collaboratively here so you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our users: It is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h3><span>How to Apply</span></h3>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li><span>Apply here (https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9pz)&nbsp;by 11:59PM on </span><span>June 23rd, 2019.

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that’s a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.</p>\n <p>Because we’re more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;<em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases, results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.</p>\n <p>See how our clients&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we’ve received</a>&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/holiday-collaboration-with-velodrome-coffee/' rel='nofollow'>holiday gifts</a>&nbsp;each year. Or, if you’re a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/seaworthy/' rel='nofollow'>Seaworthy</a>, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We’re excited about what we’ve achieved in the last few years, but we’re just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!</p>\n <h4><span>A Day In The Life</span></h4>\n <p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p>\n <h4><span>What Does Success Look Like?</span></h4>\n <p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you’ll receive extensive on the job training including a customized trail of technical assessments and assignments. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p>\n <p>You’ll have dedicated pairing time scheduled with various colleagues to cover different skills, and we’ll even participate in several mock client meetings so your first standup or sprint planning meeting doesn’t carry with it the weight of your first client interaction. After this training period, you’ll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You’ll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<span><em>Welcome aboard!</em></span></p>\n <p><span>Ongoing Support</span></p>\n <p>Each week, you’ll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Individual quarterly goal progress</li>\n  <li>Project status / team issues / weekly retro</li>\n  <li>Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire</li>\n </ul>\n <p><span>Quarterly and Annual Reviews</span></p>\n <p>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We’re here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.</p>\n <h4><span>Experience and Results At Every Level</span></h4>\n <p>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019. Our business is guided by&nbsp;<a href='https://www.eosworldwide.com/eos-model' rel='nofollow'>EOS</a>&nbsp;and we have strong processes, documentation, and people to support your growth and development at Headway.

    "content": "Overview\n<br>Unmind is transforming mental health in the workplace. We have developed a market-leading digital platform, secured funding from top-tier investors, and signed contracts with a variety of global corporations… but we’re just getting started. \n<br>\n<br>We have humongous plans –and need lots of help in achieving them– which is why we’re looking for an exceptional individual to join as our first content person to lead Unmind’s content marketing efforts moving forward.\n<br>\n<br>About Unmind \n<br>Unmind is a workplace mental health platform – providing clinically-backed tools, training, and assessments that anyone can use to proactively improve their mental wellbeing. Our digital platform is beautifully designed, non-stigmatising and globally scalable – helping to create healthier, happier, more human organisations around the world.\n<br>\n<br>We believe that everyone has the right to a healthy mind –because we all have mental health, all of the time– and we’re striving to create a world where mental health is universally understood, nurtured, and celebrated.\n<br>\n<br>The Role – Content Marketing Manager\n<br>As a team of thirty-six, everyone does a bit of everything and we’re a SUPER flat organisation –all opinions are valued regardless of role, tenure or background– so every aspect of the business is up for debate. That said, the core remit of this particular role is to:\n<br>\n<br>Lead our content strategy, driving customer acquisition, activation and retention.\n<br>Fully conceptualise, write, and edit engaging content.\n<br>Leverage our existing relationships - clients and contributors - to add credibility.\n<br>Craft and own our tone of voice.\n<br>Ensure quality and consistency across different channels including online and events.\n<br>Ensure that all efforts are highly organised and systematically tracked.\n<br>Refine our schedule to align with key events, new research and product launches.\n<br>Optimise your output, considering SEO and Google Analytics.\n<br>Work with Design, Client Success and Sales to identify opportunities and deliver your vision.\n<br>Contribute to our wider communications strategy inc. PR relationships etc.\n<br>Grow Unmind into a global thought leader that is truly loved!\n<br>\n<br>Responsibilities\n<br>We are looking for someone to lead Unmind’s content marketing activities. To-date most of our content has been written by different members of the Unmind team, but we feel that now is the right time to scale our efforts, professionalise our approach, and grow Unmind into a global thought leader.\n<br>\n<br>This role will require working incredibly closely in collaboration with our Head of Marketing as well as our Sales and Client Success teams to ensure we are always aligned and working towards the same overarching objectives. The successful candidate will be extremely bright, unwaveringly candid, and bring oodles of insight to the table. If you’re ambitious, creative and articulate, then this is an opportunity to oversee all-things content marketing at a fast-growth, high-impact startup. \n<br>\n<br>Here’s how your skills and passion will come to life at Unmind:\n<br>\n<br>Build: Design, develop, and deliver Unmind’s content marketing strategy. This will include (but is not limited to): content creation and deployment; tone of voice and positioning; optimising SEO and discoverability whilst tracking progress.\n<br>Redefine: Transform the world’s perception of mental health. Unmind is changing the landscape of mental healthcare, and your input will play an enormous role in how we achieve that. You will need to create effective content that elevates the subject whilst ensuring that we always uphold our core values.\n<br>Collaborate: Harness the kaleidoscope of personal stories and professional expertise from across the Unmind team to inspire others around our mission/vision/purpose. Work with our phenomenal clients, users and collaborators to leverage their shared passion, testimonials, and insights around improving workplace mental health.\n<br>Implement: Instill analytics and reporting around all content initiatives to enhance business predictability and transparency. Help define, track and manage company KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) associated with content marketing. \n<br>Reflect: Review all content and communication activity to-date, retrospectively looking for opportunities or improvements that will enhance efficiency/effectiveness. Compile periodic reporting and insights from ongoing content efforts to aid internal planning and enhance our collective understanding of what is/isn’t striking a chord with the market. \n<br>Partner: Proactively connect with early-adopters, industry experts, and thought-leaders within the market to ensure that our messaging is always striking the right chord.\n<br>Grow: We love working with people who are naturally curious and always seek opportunities to learn. We have a hugely experienced team but none of us think we are the finished article. You shall expect to be challenged and to challenge others internally. We are striving to create something truly special so egos need to be left at the door.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Skills and Experience\n<br>As with any B2B organisation, the success of Unmind depends on every member of staff being professional, amicable, and building strong relationships – both internally and with external stakeholders. Our ideal candidate traits are as follows:\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>ESSENTIAL: \n<br>\n<br>3+ years of content marketing experience – ideally within a tech-led enterprise environment.\n<br>Experience building a successful B2B enterprise content marketing strategy. \n<br>Ability to leverage a network of clients/experts/ambassadors.\n<br>A love for storytelling, and a natural ability to engage customers and prospects.\n<br>Exceptional writing, editing, and verbal communications skills.\n<br>Excellent editorial and copywriting abilities, including long form and short form content.\n<br>Ability and willingness to source knowledge and research topics independently.\n<br>Understand the B2B marketing funnel, including the customer's journey.\n<br>Creative, innovative and have an eye for detail.\n<br>Autonomous attitude (you *do not* require (or like) micro-management).\n<br>An ability to simplify, communicate, and sell ideas to multiple groups of stakeholders, with a relentless enthusiasm to over-deliver on targets and expectations.\n<br>Bona. Fide. Hustler. If it needs doing, you’ll get it done - somehow, some way.\n<br>Hungry to make Unmind the global category leader within workplace mental health.\n<br>Not a terrible human being… Ideally a great one. We’re a tight team and want to stay that way.\n<br>\n<br>DESIRED:\n<br>Passion for mental health, tech-for-good, and generally improving people’s lives.\n<br>Prior role(s) within a B2B SaaS environment and/or HR Tech experience.\n<br>Previous startup and/or entrepreneurial experience (inc. being innovative with resources!)\n<br>Comfortable working for a small, rapid growth business with constant change/unknowns.\n<br>Bonus points for expertise in video production, graphic design, or website management.\n<br>Passionate about design, UX and beautiful brands.\n<br>\n<br>The Opportunity\n<br>You will be joining an exceptionally talented core team who –in the last 24-months– have secured incredible investors, partners, clients and advocates. Our future success(es) will rely on the continuation of that momentum – of which our ability to enhance (and leverage) Unmind’s market presence will be paramount. If done right, then the opportunity for this individual (and Unmind generally) is vast, compounded and –perhaps most importantly– will genuinely improve people’s lives.\n<br>\n<br>Location: Unmind’s London office (London Bridge / Borough)\n<br>\n<br>Benefits\n<br>Great colleagues (personally and professionally) \n<br>Pick your own tech\n<br>Regular social company gatherings \n<br>Optional team walks, runs and mindfulness sessions \n<br>Wellbeing budget to use at your discretion \n<br>Office perks (free on-site gym, rooftop bar, wellbeing events)\n<br>A culture of continuous learning \n<br>Pension and generous holiday policy \n<br>Dog-friendly workplace\n<br>\n<br>Hours: Regular 09:00–18:00 working day (with capacity for remote working and flexible hours). \n<br>\n<br>Remuneration: Salary TBC - reflective of candidate experience and skill set.",

Find out more about our services \n  <br> \n  <br>Our motto: Traffic is nice. Revenue is better. \n  <br> \n  <br>We have the most fun doing it in competitive environments such as finance, education, jobs, insurance, automotive and many more. \n  <br> \n  <br>We strive on being an extension of our client’s team and providing tailor-made, return-focused work. \n  <br> \n  <br>We are picky about the clients we bring on-board and very protective of our reputation. We won’t engage with a firm unless we believe we can make a difference to their business and help them Get Stuff Done! \n  <br> \n  <br>This stops us from taking on board demoralizing projects and having us hating our jobs and our clients. \n  <br> \n  <br>We think the current agency model is broken and we really believe we can build a better alternative. But we need great people to help make this happen and that’s where you come in! \n  <br> \n  <br>We are a bootstrapped company, we grew exponentially in the last few years and now seating at 60 people working with us. \n  <br> \n  <br>We are built to be remote from day 1, but if you want to say ‘Hello’, our office is 78 meters from the beach in Sydney. Make sure you bring your swimwear! \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>**The Opportunity** \n  <br> \n  <br>We are looking for a passionate and creative Social Media Advertising Specialist to join our growing team.

The last one was in October in Borneo. \n  <br> \n  <br>An important point that is often overlooked: you will be truly part of a team. For most remote workers, you can easily feel isolated from what's happening in the business. We take good care of our teammates. So much so that a person who joined our team late November told us recently that she has felt more part of a team, than when she was working in an office. \n  <br> \n  <br>Don't take our word for it.

Did you have fun doing it? Could you explain to them why it was not working? \n<br>\n<br>Are you the person who everyone asks for help with their mobile phone or computer? Do you enjoy it for the fun - and wish you could get paid for it?\n<br>\n<br>And, what about being part of a fast-paced startup environment? Would that be interesting? If so, then this role is for you!\n<br>\n<br>*Who is OWLR?*\n<br>&quot;OWLR&quot;:http://www.owlr.com is a multinational team working to make home security cameras smarter, simpler and even more secure. Rather than being a boring alarm company, we here at OWLR are injecting humour, ease of use and amazing user experiences into our products to make Moms and Dads really happy.\n<br>\n<br>One of the key parts of our business are the people who work with our users through email and chats. You would be the front face of our company with our users and get your hands dirty with testing our apps with cameras from around the world and being the discoverer of what works and does not work with our products. \n<br>\n<br>You get to work from your home office, with a great team and gain a set of amazing experiences.\n<br>\n<br>*WHAT ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES?*\n<br>As the User Advocate, you will:\n<br>\n<br>* *Engage with Users on Email and Forums* - our users send us emails to solve their problems, and you get to use our Knowledge base and engineers to find solutions and reply in a prompt and friendly manner. You get to use your problem solving skills to diagnose and teach them the steps to solve their problem - since every question is often a new puzzle each time.\n<br>\n<br>* *Engage with Users on Apple App Store and Google Play Store* - with over 1.7M downloads, we get lots of compliments and chats on the Apple and Google App Stores - and you are the voice of the product there.\n<br>\n<br>* *Play with and test the Apps as we release them* - since the engineers are furiously working to build better apps for our users, you are the key person who learns what we are doing, and how we can make sure we serve the users first and foremost.\n<br>\n<br>*WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR*\n<br>*You. Or someone like you.* You will likely have some enthusiasms that we are looking to work with:\n<br>\n<br>* *KEY SKILL: You love the English language* - you use words to explain thoughts and care about spelling, even a bit of grammar and love showing off your vocabulary. Our team is distributed around the world and your skill in communication is key to make everything work out right.\n<br>\n<br>* *You act with a sense of responsibility* - rather than an office environment with your boss looking over your head, you OWN your tasks and deliver on them to your users and the whole team’s needs.\n<br>\n<br>* *KEY SKILL: You love to solve problems and dive right in* - you want to solve problems and look for cause and effect, triggers and outcomes. We have plenty of technology puzzles in that our past staff of engineers, teachers, literature students, designer and others on how to solve - it always comes down to YOUR interest and ability to solve puzzles.\n<br>\n<br>* *KEY SKILL: You have a high level of emotional intelligence, empathy and maturity* – can you stay calm and professional, even when under pressure? Because our users are people too! They and the engineers (and the CEO) all have passion for our product, and you are the tip of the soft sword making things better for us all.\n<br>\n<br>* *You are adaptable and have a real sense of humor* – life is unpredictable and we can guarantee that no day “at the office” will ever be the same.\n<br>\n<br>* *You have the confidence to speak out on behalf of the users* - instead of treating our users as ATMs, we work hard to make our users successful - because when users are happy, we are successful. YOU have the responsibility and the empathy to make changes.\n<br>\n<br>* *You are a stickler for detail* - you are the one that tells us when things are going wrong on the web, in reviews, in our emails - you are the person who makes us look great!\n<br>\n<br>* *You have a SOLID Internet connection (or could get one)* - you need to be well-connected and have solid computer skills.\n<br>\n<br>* *You have a general understanding of technology and the ability to understand how software works* - this may seem simple, but do you know how Microsoft Word works? How the file is stored on the system and how Word saves files and makes edits? How the webpage you pulled up in your browser showed up there? And would you LIKE to learn?\n<br>\n<br>*IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU HAD...*\n<br>Yeah - this is a list of other traits that are possible, but you will likely learn as you work with us and the team. Things like:\n<br>\n<br>* *General Network Technology Understanding* (e.g. What is an IP address? What are ports? What is DNS for? What is UDP?)\n<br>\n<br>* *Experience with IP Cameras/IP Cams/CCTV*\n<br>\n<br>* *Working knowledge of the Android and iOS operating systems* (how they work, not just using them on your phone)\n<br>\n<br>*WHAT DO WE WANT?*\n<br>We want you to grow and develop and help us do the same. We are looking for you to join us and we ask, aside from your responsibilities of managing the users and solving their problems, we need you to make yourself available on text (or Slack) during working hours and be responsive and make the company-wide afternoon video call set at 4:40 PST (usually). \n<br>\n<br>You could work in our flexible workspace or from your own home and you will be working with an internationally distributed team from London, San Francisco, Sao Paulo, Pakistan and Cape Town.\n<br>\n<br>*WANT TO LEARN MORE?*\n<br>Please submit your CV, github account (if you have one) and a response to the questions below an answer to the following question the address in the posting.\n<br>\n<br>* *Cover Letter:* send us a focussed cover letter explaining why you would be great for this role. Include experiences or reasons that makes YOU uniquely qualified for this.\n<br>\n<br>* *Personal Story:* Additionally, we would like you to tell us a story of a time where you had to figure out something in order to help a person other than yourself. \n<br>\n<br>Specifically, tell us about a situation where you had to help someone figure something out that you had no knowledge of. For instance:\n<br>\n<br>* Someone asked you for directions and you had no idea where the place was. What did you do? How did it turn out?\n<br>\n<br>* Someone asked how to use a feature on Microsoft Word you had never used. What did you do? How did it turn out?\n<br>\n<br>* Someone asked you how to do a particularly tough writing assignment that you had never done before. What did you do? How did it turn out?",

We launched our probate service in March 2019, helping families at the difficult, emotional time of a bereavement.\n<br>\n<br>We’re a growing, tight-knit, multidisciplinary team of 25+ genuinely nice people. We're at the forefront of legal technology, playing a crucial role in modernising important legal services. In January 2019 we received £8m in Series A funding.\n<br>\n<br>*The opportunity for a user researcher:*\n<br>\n<br>You’ll be working on the fascinating, difficult problem of death. Our customers are facing difficult choices that impact the rest of their lives: they may be planning for the future; they may be dying; they may have lost a loved one. It’s a challenging subject and a challenging market. What we do has a big impact on real people.\n<br>\n<br>We have a strong research and design culture, from the ground up and top down. Our design team are generalists with a strong focus on research, and our developers are user-focused. We work collaboratively on problems and user needs. But... we have no dedicated user researcher! You’ll be the first. This is an amazing opportunity for you to define the discipline of user research at Farewill and cement a strong research-and-user-centric ideology. Make it your own. In time we hope you’ll have the opportunity to lead other researchers, if you aspire to leadership.\n<br>\n<br>*About you:*\n<br>\n<br>You’re empathetic. You’re an experienced user researcher. You’re a generalist: you apply the right method to the question at hand. Your first love is qualitative research but you have a solid grounding in quant. You have plenty of hands on experience of research in its many forms, but for you it’s never just about outputs: it’s about bringing people along on the journey, furthering a shared business mission and - most of all - working in teams to build brilliant, user-centric products.\n<br>\n<br>*In the next 12 months, you’ll:*\n<br>\n<br>* Work embedded in our wills and probate teams, collaborating closely with product managers, designers, developers and others to build products that solve problems and meet user needs\n<br>* Improve existing products and help launch new ones\n<br>* Build the research function at Farewill from scratch, in collaboration with and support from Tom Hiskey, Victor Hwang and others in the design and tech teams\n<br>* Gain a deep understanding of our products, users and business goals: you’ll be the main voice of the user in the business\n<br>* Plan, run and analyse qualitative studies, including interviews, remote and in-person usability tests, and contextual and ethnographic research (yes you’ll be running usability tests, but this role is much more than just testing)\n<br>* Document and curate research, building a central knowledge resource for future projects\n<br>* Communicate findings not only within the product teams but also with the wider business, to help bring others along on the journey\n<br>\n<br>*Ideally you'll have some or all of the following:*\n<br>\n<br>* Empathy, listening and ability to speak with customers at a difficult time\n<br>* Experience leading the research effort within a product team\n<br>* Working collaboratively with designers, developers and others to build fantastic products\n<br>* Experience organising and running research studies and recruiting participants\n<br>* Experience with a variety of qualitative methods, such as remote and in-person usability testing, interviews, diary studies, ethnographic research and card-sorting\n<br>* A grounding in quantitative research including surveys and data analysis\n<br>* Self-organised and able to handle multiple projects and priorities\n<br>* A brilliant communicator: you bring research to life, bringing practical ideas to teams to help build user-focused solutions\n<br>* Ability to bring the team along on the journey and buy into the value of research\n<br>* Pragmatism: you apply the right amount of research for a given context and problem\n<br>\n<br>*Bonus points for:*\n<br>* Experience working with bereaved or vulnerable users\n<br>* Being scrappy and working on a few things at once (we’re a startup!)\n<br>* Working with other insight-driven people including data analysts and quant researchers\n<br>Complementary interests or experiences beyond research (for example, many of our developers have design backgrounds)\n<br>\n<br>BENEFITS\n<br>Competitive salary and share options\n<br>Santander cycles membership\n<br>Regular off-site days and team lunches\n<br>Work from home on Wednesdays, flexible start and end to your day\n<br>28 days holiday + bank holidays",

    "content": "About movemeon\n<br>\n<br>We’re a fast growing, tech-enabled, central London based growth business. We were founded with the simple aim to make discovering great jobs easier. \n<br>\n<br>Today Movemeon is used by 35,000+ members, 2,500+ businesses (from the likes of Uber and Apple to early stage VC-backed startups) and in 100+ countries. ~200 candidates and ~15 businesses join the membership every week. We deliver them unique opportunities, insight and events through an exclusive members network.\n<br>\n<br>We are also planning to expand fast into new geographies and new professional niches as well as exploring exciting new products like payspective.com. It’s all go!\n<br>\n<br>We can take you through our vision when we meet you. Suffice to say, we are thinking big and need your help to execute. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>The team\n<br>\n<br>The two founders, Nick Patterson and Richard Rosser set-up movemeon after their frustration with recruitment agencies. We are now a team of 16 and are highly international (French, Italian, Portuguese, German). We’re continuing to expand and expect a steady flow of new joiners this year. Our office is near Vauxhall (central London) in a complex also home to other growth businesses. \n<br>\n<br>About the Product manager role\n<br>\n<br>We are looking for someone to take our product to the next level. It’s an opportunity to be hands-on and take as much responsibility as you can handle, managing our developers and participating in the creation of the product vision/ roadmap from day one. \n<br>\n<br>Your key responsibilities will include:\n<br>• Understanding our users: speak to our customers and understand what they like, and what frustrates them. Use this intelligence, plus feedback collated from the team, to understand what we need to build as a priority.\n<br>• Managing the product roadmap: You’ll be working with our head of product to understand how the product can be optimized for each function (in addition to the user priorities). You’ll participate in the creation of the product roadmap, prioritizing the ongoing delivery of highest impact changes. You will also communicate progress against this roadmap to the broader team: putting you at the centre of the business\n<br>• Owning our email: You’ll be the owner of all the automatic emails that come from our site and will be in charge of their optimisation\n<br>• Running the sprint process: You’ll help the teams to develop great technical and design specifications for the developers to work towards. You’ll then lead a team of two back-end developers (offshore) to deliver against these specifications. You will have responsibility for improving the process/ managing the contract with the developers to ensure they are delivering to our standards\n<br>• Identifying high-impact UX changes: we want you to be consistently updating the look and feel of the site. You will be expected to regularly use the site as a “user” and see what frustrates you\n<br>• Measure and iterate: Measure the impact of the changes we make, and use the results to inform further product changes. We measure the impact of pretty much everything we do. So you’ll get to see (and analyse) plenty of interesting data that will show just how much your hard work is contributing to the growth of the business. \n<br>\n<br>What the right candidate will bring to the table\n<br> \n<br>We’re looking for someone with coding experience (PHP and HTML) or a degree in computer science. Strong problem solving and logic, as well as analytics, are great for any product role. \n<br>\n<br>Specifically we’re looking for:\n<br>• Knowledge of PHP and HTML/ degree in computer science\n<br>• Evidence that you are a 'do-er' (yes, thinking is important but lots of stuff needs to get done). You’ll be proactive and demonstrate that you get stuck in, organize things and have probably always had holiday jobs / part time work etc.\n<br>• Super organized – we are growing fast which means things change regularly and can be chaotically busy. You’ll need to keep a clear head and religiously get through your to do list. \n<br>• Entrepreneurship in your DNA – you never fancied / tried but got frustrated with a corporate job.\n<br>• Desire to take on responsibility quickly. As MMO grows, we’ll want you to grow with us. So that means quickly stepping up to manage more aspects of the business and potentially more people too.\n<br>• Minimum of a 2:1 degree from a UK Russell Group (or international equivalent) university\n<br>• Fluent written and spoken English\n<br>• Fun team member (we have lots of it)\n<br> \n<br> \n<br>So if this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you (see details below). \n<br>\n<br>About our offer:\n<br>\n<br>• Exciting business in a time of rapid growth\n<br>• Start-up environment and ethos (i.e. we don’t do face time and we don’t do anything that doesn’t need to be done)\n<br>• Respect for and encouragement of your own ideas and initiatives\n<br>• Real responsibility\n<br>• Fun, smart team of normal people\n<br>• A sensible work life balance (we leave the office by 6pm every day and don’t work weekends)\n<br>• Monthly team fun &amp; annual away weeks (like last year’s trips to Montenegro and Barcelona)\n<br>• An office in central SW London (we’re based near Vauxhall tube)\n<br>• 25 days holiday + 2 extra days at Christmas\n<br>• Competitive salary &amp; quarterly bonus related to metrics you can track and control\n<br>",

We aim to expand our platform in the US within the next thirty-six months. \n<br>\n<br>We combine market research, digital advertising and paid surveys to offer an all-in-one powerful and effective online platform. Our platform delivers targeted consumer data to organisations through survey responses filled out by our users. Survey campaigns are created by researchers, promoted by our promoters and completed by our users. We aim to build a more ethical and efficient data market where consumers, freelancers and SME's are treated and rewarded fairly. \n<br>\n<br>We have a growing sign-up list of users however as I lack experience in sales and business development, our start-up is in need of a savvy, persistent and bright individual who wishes to learn and help grow a truly disruptive product. The ideal co-founder can manage the entire business development and sales side of the company, including outreach to potential clients, booking and attending client meetings, and pitching and selling the product in-person and on multiple platforms. \n<br>\n<br>As a team, we work from home and set weekly meetings to effectively communicate. We aim to relocate into a small office in the coming months, depending on our outreach success. The ideal co-founder can travel easily and is able to attend occasional team meetings in central London. So far, the role is unpaid and the successful applicant would have significant shares in the company, with the intention of growing the company over a 5+ year period. \n<br>\n<br>I believe people are the most precious resource in an organisation. This is not a journey for the faint-hearted and though I am still learning myself, I'm an incredibly driven and motivated young entrepreneur who focuses on building sustainable, long-term relationships with both clients and the team. Don't worry if you're not incredibly experienced, I prioritise potential over achievements. \n<br>\n<br>If your ambition is to grow a start-up from the ground up and begin working as part of a small team of 3 to build a platform into a global brand, you've come to the right vacancy.",

Twice a year we meet up somewhere around the world to spend time with one another. We see these retreats as an opportunity to strengthen the social fiber of our community.\n   </div>\n   <div>\n    This team is growing in more ways than one - we’ve recently launched 8 babies (and counting!). Unanimously, our favorite and most impactful value is “Build a house you want to live in.” We strive to make decisions that are authentic for our organization.

When developing these solutions, we think about the problem end-to-end: how do we automatically collect data from common data sources, store it efficiently in Elasticsearch, present this information to the user, correlate and enhance across data sources, what actions do we take on the insights from the data? All of these aspects are important in bringing a turnkey solution to the market.</p>\n <p>As a Senior Product Manager responsible for the logging use case, you'll be involved with everything related to log analytics at Elastic, from directly impacting the roadmap to the go-to-market strategy.

Not the indulgent kind where you obsess over trivial details, but taking the extra time to get it right when it matters most, of being so good at what you do it leaves people awestruck.</li>\n  <li>We believe we can be even more productive at home than at an office. Sure, nobody is watching over our shoulders to see if we’re productive, but they don’t have to. We get so much done there’s absolutely no doubt we are staying on task. And yes, pajamas are totally a productivity enhancer.</li>\n  <li>We believe flexibility is a two-way street. Yes, we have the freedom to adjust our schedule whenever there’s not a meeting, but we’re also available when a teammate runs into a problem or there’s an urgent issue, even when it’s not during our normal hours.</li>\n  <li>We believe in peace and quiet. No politics, no drama, no needless meetings, no distracting our teammates. Instead, we create a space where everyone can focus, and in that space, we do the deep work that really matters.</li>\n  <li>We believe in doing what’s right for our customers, even when it’s painful<strong>.</strong> Sometimes that means offering a refund when it’s against policy, giving them a bit of free coaching, or referring them to another company that can serve them better. It may not be convenient, it may not be profitable, but it’s right, and that’s all that matters.</li>\n </ol>\n <p><strong>How to apply:</strong></p>\n <p>The interview process begins with an online application</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://smartblogger.com/marketing-automation-specialist-2' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",
