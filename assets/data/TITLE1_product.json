If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. Also, we work remotely (we all work from where we live). </p><p>&quot;Hashtags! Yay!&quot;</p><p>NO!!! </p><p>That's not actually what we're about. We build a suite of SaaS products for people and companies that expect social ROI: they need to get something back when they share to social.</p><p>RiteForge and RiteBoost do total social media optimization: images, custom visuals, link ads - and data-driven auto-hashtagging as well. For those who need to get business, sign-ups, or sales from what they share in Facebook, Twitter and beyond, RiteForge automates image creation and extraction, adds a call-to-action header to pages shared socially, and uses text analysis and machine learning to aid with hashtags as well.  </p><p>What is RiteKit?<br>The initial concept for RiteTag, our first product, was borne of the aftermath of the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. After witnessing the flurry of disorganized social media activity, our CEO and Founder wanted to help people get their social content discovered in an increasing noisy world.<br>What SEO does for web pages, SMO (social media optimization) does for video uploads, sound files, Facebook updates, Tweets... and it is much more than hashtags that does this. Today we continue to build tools to further our original mission to increase the customer's social media presence.</p><p>We build data-driven social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>What mktg/bizdev Interns (and staff) do:<br>• Learn far more than they teach in any university degree to prepare for a successful career in PR, Business Development or as an entrepreneur. (Best case scenario: after this internship you either launch your own startup, join one as a co-founder, or become so important to us that you create a position for yourself on our team.)<br>• Forge alliances with people at companies and startups that should be using our APIs and/or SaaS products<br>• Engage our growing community in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium and beyond.<br>• Write case study articles for our blogs.<br>• Do what it takes to get original articles on getting things done with RiteKit in major news sites and top-tier blogs.<br>• Learn how to win at marketing</p><p>Terms &amp; Requirements:<br>• Ability to learn and teach RiteKit products and coach a business owner to use them so that they get social ROI. This will be your entry exam and how you will qualify for the internship.<br>• Ability to collaborate in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>• Commitment: 6 months at 3-5 hours/week OR 12 months at 2~3 hours/week (decide later, no rush)<br>• Be okay with the internship being UNPAID. <br>• Must be well-written and have proven ability to create visual content<br>• No relocation needed; we work remotely</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers. </p><p>As a self funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends that have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time.</p></div>",

Through relentless customer development we’ve identified an enormous market opportunity for Content Operations (ContentOps).<br><br>ContentOps addresses the gap that exists between content strategy and publishing platforms/traditional CMS'. Without dedicated ContentOps there is complete chaos resulting in poor content, costing organisations time, money and reputation.<br><br>We help our customers unify their people, process and content. They're now able to quickly produce and publish effective content at scale; with less headaches, less errors and better results.<br><br>Our view is that effective content is going to be prioritised in every business and organisation and well executed ContentOps will be a requirement for this to happen. We’re already seeing this in our roster of customers; from Higher Education to Healthcare, Harvard to the NHS.<br><br><br>**What’s the role?**<br><br>You’ll be primarily responsible for helping our existing and prospective customers understand, and get excited, by the value our Content Operations Platform offers. You’ll figure out how to open their eyes to new and better ways of working.<br><br>Day-to-day you’ll take ownership over product and feature launches, developing and executing GTM strategies for various verticals and product use-cases. You’ll work closely with our customers to develop a deep understanding of their challenges and discover new ways to tell their stories. You’ll support the sales team to ensure they have everything they need to bring new customers on board and expand existing accounts.<br><br>You’ll also help champion the development and popularisation of a new category. You’ll have ownership over your numbers and how you hit them. You’ll obsess over how to position us in the minds of our customers and finally, you’ll continuously improve yourself and support your colleagues.<br><br>**What we can offer you:**<br>* Remote working - we offer the opportunity to work remotely. Whether you want to join a co-working space, work from home or travel: the choice and flexibility are yours.<br>* Family friendly - the company is very family oriented and understands the necessary flexibility.<br>* Work/life balance - we work a 35 hour week and encourage downtime.

You must be happy to take critique, self-improve and move forward.<br>* An iterative approach - We focus on learning and improving our processes as we go.<br>* Customer focus - You should always be thinking, “What can I be doing to deliver value to our customers?”<br>* Leave your ego at the door. We’ve got a very collaborative, blame-free culture with a shared focus on what’s best for the company.<br><br><h2>Requirements</h2>**How to apply**We’d love to see some examples of your work, your blog (if you have one) and a cover letter with answers to the following questions:* Why do you want to work at GatherContent?* Can you share a piece of work that you’re proud of, or that you think represents an important part of your philosophy?* Can you tell us about a hard problem you’ve had to solve, and how you went about solving it?* Can you give us a brief description of your background?Also, please include the word ‘blueberry’ in your cover letter to show that you’ve read the job role (helps us weed out time wasters!).

Our long term aim is to create a single network where people and businesses can share their digital identity securely and interchangeably - whether they’re applying for a mortgage, listing on the stock market, or applying for a new job.
