    "content": "<p><strong>About Us</strong></p><br /><p>Planes is a young digital product studio, started by two friends who liked making great products together. As we grow that will always be our essence - to work on products we believe in with people we enjoy every day.</p><br /><p>Our background is in startups, not agencies. We prefer shipping code, listening to users and iterating quickly rather than long lunches, &lsquo;expert&rsquo; reports and death by powerpoint. This approach has lead us to work with all sorts of people, from international fin-tech providers to startups, building products that their users love.</p><br /><p>A small and nimble team, we work collaboratively to produce work that we are proud of and our clients love. We are made up of designers, engineers and product lovers who are all entrepreneurs by nature.</p><br /><p><strong>The Role</strong></p><br /><p>We are looking for a Junior Product Manager to join our team full time. You will be responsible for managing a number of products at once, both new projects and retainers for existing products. Working in a multi-disciplinary team you will be the voice of the user, while also keeping sprints running on time and budget. Days will be varied and could involve any of the following:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Running user interviews to uncover insights</li><br /><li>Testing prototypes with users to understand usability and solution fit</li><br /><li>Digging into data to inform decisions and query hypothesis</li><br /><li>Collaborating with a designer to convert ideas into a tangible product</li><br /><li>Writing user stories and managing development pipelines to ensure delivery stays on track</li><br /><li>Running product demos and sprint planning sessions with clients and the development team</li><br /><li>Researching and making recommendations for solutions to product problems, or to help with product goals</li><br /><li>Wireframing and mapping out user journeys</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>About you</strong></p><br /><p>For this role, you will have the right combination of experience and skills to manage multiple projects and priorities. You will need to be able to take the initiative and be organised as the rest of the team will rely on you to keep workflows moving in the right direction. Tonnes of experience is not required, but here is some idea of the kinds of experience that would suit:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Client facing; communicating directly with clients both written and in person</li><br /><li>UX research/design; an appreciation of how users interact with products, how to map and measure these journeys and the ability to improve them. You might have some experience with wireframing too.</li><br /><li>Project planning; aptitude at managing many moving parts and conflicting stakeholders requirements</li><br /><li>Specification writing; translating designs or requirements to user stories for developers to build</li><br /><li>Scrum/agile exposure; you will have exposure to the principles of agile development, and know how to adapt a development framework to suit various types of projects.</li><br /><li>Exposure to deliverying digital projects; this doesn't have to be apps it could be micro sites or campaigns for an agency too for example</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Working at Planes</strong></p><br /><p>We are a relatively relaxed bunch, and believe that if we hire adults and treat them like them we won't need any baby sitters. As such we leave it to you to decide where and when you will do your best work. If you need to stay at home and nut out a tough problem so be it, if you have to come in late because you are dancing at Morning Glory -power too you! That being said, we all tend to spend most of our time in the studio because we have more fun working together, so this is not a fully remote role.</p><br /><p>We are also a social bunch and since we work with people we like we tend to hang out after work too. We don't really plan anything but tend to find ourselves doing at least one activity together a month be it mountain biking, rock climbing or just going out for beers. We also get that you have your own life too, so won't be upset if you can't join us every Friday night.</p><br /><p>Holidays are the spice of life, so on top of your 28 days a year, we also let you take up to a month of leave without pay if you like to do even more adventuring.</p><br /><p><strong>Hiring process</strong></p><br /><p>If this sounds like a piece of you, please send through a short (no longer than one paragraph) intro on you along with your CV. If we like what we see we will start with a phone call. Following that we will send you across a small challenge for you to work on and come in to present back to us, at the same time we will introduce you to the team, show you our office and have a chat over a coffee.</p>",

We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;6m in venture funding from the most respected investors in technology and real estate. Our vision is to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed. The beginning of this journey is our online platform to help businesses rent, manage and share office space in London.</p><br /><p>As a product designer at Hubble, you will have the opportunity to add your magic to every stage of the design process. Working closely with product managers and tech leads, you will have the autonomy to conjure up functional yet delightful solutions to genuine user problems. All the while working towards business goals.</p><br /><p>Your role will of course include wire-framing, prototyping and spinning up high fidelity designs and assets but this is only a small part. Through user testing and internal feedback sessions, you will be responsible for continually testing ideas and assumptions and mixing your findings back into the designs. You will be able to use these findings to explain and defend your design rationale with the wider team and stakeholders. Excellent communication skills, explaining complex solutions in simple terms and the ability to challenge people in the wider team at all levels, backed with evidence, are all crucial.</p><br /><p>Strong visual UI design is a given, but beyond that you will be instrumental in following and helping to build out the Hubble design system. You will work closely with our engineers and regularly pair with them to help set the rules and ingredients for new design assets and components. A keen eye for detail is important but you should understand the trade-offs between striving for pixel-perfection against good enough to ship fast.</p><br /><p>You will possess a functional but creative mind and a no-fear attitude to your work. With a scientific approach to product design, don't be afraid to fail-fast and learn. You will feel empowered to push the needle, and suggest wildcard ideas that may make some colleagues squirm, but always be grounded in the possible. We build our products in an iterative, continuous deployment style, but as a designer you should always be thinking of where we want to be rather than just what's next.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>REQUIREMENTS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years experience in designing digital products.</li><br /><li>Fully proficient in designing for various screen sizes with a mobile first approach to responsive design.</li><br /><li>Solid understanding of UX design principles.</li><br /><li>Good understanding of atomic design and front end architecture.</li><br /><li>Expertise in the tools of the trade, sketch, invision etc. UI animations desirable but not required.</li><br /><li>Have the confidence to explain and defend design decisions to colleagues at all levels.</li><br /><li>Experience in mapping out user journeys and flows.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>&nbsp;</h2><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>BENEFITS</h2><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture.

Backed by some of Europe&rsquo;s leading venture capital firms, Dalia is one of Germany&rsquo;s fastest-growing tech startups with a team from 32 different countries driven by one mission: to generate information that helps us better understand the world around us.</p><br /><p>Dalia is on the search for a Social Media Manager to invigorate our presence on all social media channels to better engage with our target communities.</p><br /><p><strong>The journey that awaits you</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Despite a wealth of source material for spreading the word about Dalia to prospective clients, talent, and journalists, we aren&rsquo;t consistently active in sharing them across channels, such as social media, where these audiences are looking.

    "content": "<h1><strong>About us</strong></h1><br /><p>We are on a journey to make pet healthcare more accessible, and we want you to help us! Did you know that only 8% of health issues are seen by a veterinary professional? In real numbers: pets experience 24 issues per year, but only 2 of them make it to the vet. This isn&rsquo;t because people are bad at being pet owners &mdash; going to the vet can be expensive, and takes a lot of effort, and sometimes it&rsquo;s even embarrassing. We want to remove all these barriers that stop pet parents from seeking expert care so that our pets can live the long and healthy lives they deserve.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our mission is to empower vets to advocate for their patients wherever and whenever suits them. Our current product provides an app-based approach that allows vets to interact with their patients through a combination of chat and video consultations. The future holds lots of exciting opportunities to expand this into the go-to app for all things pet care related. Gula recently raised a pre-seed round of funding, and off the back of that, we are looking to build the beginnings of our product team, which is where you come in. With a goal like allowing pets to live healthier lives, a fantastic experience across all our user facing products is going to be key to overcoming challenges in changing the way pet owners think about how they interact with their care providers.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our customer facing products right now are in the form of iOS &amp; Android apps written in React Native, with a web-app soon to follow. We envisage most pet owners interacting with their vets through digital means via their mobile devices. To date, most UX work has been done in Sketch, but we are open to any tooling that can do the job well!</p><br /><h1><strong>Who we&rsquo;re looking for</strong></h1><br /><p>You would be the first Product Designer working at Gula, which gives you the opportunity to help architect the ways of working in the product team and put in place what we would consider to be best practices. Your primary responsibility will be to deliver fantastic user experiences across our range of user-facing products, both to pet owners and vets. Here are some projects you might work on in the next six months:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Building the base of a design system for Gula.</li><br /><li>Designing innovative ways for pet owners to communicate with their vet.</li><br /><li>Redesigning our website to speak to our target customers better.</li><br /><li>Crafting the language we use to speak to our users.</li><br /><li>Testing new propositions with our users.</li><br /><li>Building a library of assets to be used in marketing material.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>You might be perfect for this role if most of these apply to you:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have extensive experience designing for iOS and Android</li><br /><li>You have extensive experience designing for the responsive web</li><br /><li>You consider a close relationship with the engineering team mandatory for building great products</li><br /><li>You have worked in a start-up</li><br /><li>You have experience with user research</li><br /><li>You have experience with user testing</li><br /><li>You would describe yourself as an animal lover</li><br /><li>You are happy working autonomously</li><br /><li>You love learning new things</li><br /></ul><br /><h1><strong>Application process</strong></h1><br /><p>Once we have reviewed your CV and have decided that we could be a great mutual match, we&rsquo;d start with a short phone call or coffee to tell you more about what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve at Gula long-term and also to give you some more details about the role. Then if successful there would be a final stage where we&rsquo;d spend some more time talking about your design thinking, look at some problems together, and you would meet Gula&rsquo;s CEO Thom to find out more about our values and to see if you&rsquo;d fit in.</p><br /><h1><strong>The benefits</strong></h1><br /><ul><br /><li>Pay &pound;55,000-65,000</li><br /><li>Stock options</li><br /><li>Flexible hours</li><br /><li>Working from home when you want</li><br /><li>25 days holiday</li><br /><li>Pick your own hardware up to &pound;2000</li><br /><li>Training budget</li><br /><li>Central London office</li><br /></ul>",

With over 85,000 retrospectives run on our platform, we’re the trusted leader in our market, and we’ve been helping teams continuously improve since 2015.\\n\\nWe’re also a small, cross-functional team of passionate and fun people. We have an outstanding leadership team and a dedication to company culture, so you’ll always feel connected to our mission, even though you can work from anywhere. We’re lucky enough to have an awesome product, great revenue growth, high customer satisfaction, low churn, and a recent round of seed investment. Now, we need someone to help us take our product to the next level!\\n\\nThe right candidate for the Senior Product Designer position at Retrium is someone who has experience in a product-led organization, can translate complex customer problems into elegant solutions, understands best practices for user interface design, and likes to iterate based on research findings and customer feedback. If you’re a creative problem-solver and want to create a compelling experience for thousands of users, then come be a part of our growing team!\\n\\n### Benefits\\n\\nWe provide amazing benefits, and if you ask the team, they’ll tell you that the greatest benefits we offer employees are the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the company and the opportunities to “Listen. Learn. Teach”, another core value.\\n\\nOur other benefits include:\\n\\n- Competitive salary and equity in a fast-growing, funded startup\\n- Health, dental, and vision insurance coverage for you and your family\\n- Unlimited and minimum vacation policy (we encourage you to ask us about this!)\\n- Flexible, sustainable work hours\\n- Work from home or a co-working office\\n- All the equipment you need to do your job\\n- Continuing education and learning opportunities\\n- Annual company retreats\\n\\n### Additional Information\\n\\nRetrium is committed to creating a diverse environment where you can “Be Your Amazing Self”, yet another core value. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer, and welcome people of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n As the first dedicated product designer at Retrium, you’ll help us establish the design processes we’ll use going forward. This means you’ll need to understand the business context, customers, and technical constraints and their impact on design in addition to being a great designer. You’ll work closely with both the engineering and business teams to advocate for design in strategic product decisions and oversee the UI design implementation, so communication and collaboration will be key in this role.\\n\\nBecause you’ll own everything related to design, you’ll need to be well versed in customer research, so that you can share your concepts and get feedback from our users. You’ll translate our product’s mission and these customer research insights into an engaging and simple interface for our retrospective platform. In this role, your goal will be to continuously improve the user experience of our application, so that customers can easily adopt, understand, and interact with our product.\\n\\nDay-to-day, you’ll be responsible for creating mockups, user flows, sketches, wireframes, diagrams, customer journey maps, and other design artifacts needed to guide the product development process. The ability to take ideas from low-fidelity outlines to high-fidelity designs using Sketch, Invision, Figma, Framer, or other relevant tooling, is a big part of this role.\\n\\nBecause our core values include “Default to Autonomy”, “Bias for Action”, and “Level Up”, you’ll need to be a self-starter who can brainstorm possibilities, execute tasks, and lead the implementation of major features and changes to the product. If you want a job that’s integral to a company’s expansion and growth and where there’s opportunities to learn and make a real impact, then this role is for you! \\n\\n# Requirements\\nMore than anything else, we’re looking for a self-motivated person who is passionate about designing a great user experience within Retrium.\\n\\nWe believe that the following collection of experiences and abilities would make someone successful in this position. However, we encourage anyone with 5 or more years of professional experience as a Product Designer, UX Designer, or Front-End Engineer to apply.\\n\\n- A portfolio of relevant design work that you’re proud to share that includes digital products, not just websites\\n- A history of successfully shipping products and collaborating cross-functionally with both software engineers and business stakeholders\\n- The passion and drive to learn about Retrium and our customers\\n- A growth mindset with an openness to feedback, learning, and experimentation\\n- Experience with Agile software development processes, from problem definition through to detailed UI and visual design\\n- Experience designing a B2B SaaS product is strongly preferred\\n- Experience in a distributed team and/or high-growth startup would be helpful \\n\\n#Salary\\n100000 - 140000\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- US-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

    "content": "<h3> Humbly Confident Product Designer </h3><div><div>YNAB is growing, and so is our product design team. We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal finance apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have experience in designing great interfaces and experiences for most of those platforms. More important, you’re a designer who views your job as that of problem solver. You come to the table not only with a knack for interaction design and love of logical UI patterns, but also with a deep empathy for people. We design our software to fit our users more than our fancy, and you love nothing more than digging through (or conducting!) research that leads the way in the design process. You’ve been around the block a few times and know what it means to design a mature, evolving product.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):&nbsp;</strong></div><ul><li>You must have at least 3 years of experience working in product design <strong>at a software company.</strong> Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.</li><li>Experience in designing applications for both web and mobile (in your cover letter, please include the platforms for which you have designed and your level of experience with them).&nbsp;</li><li>We are looking for a designer who has a strong background in UX and usability but who also can design UI independently. This is a truly mixed position where you will be responsible for activities traditionally held in the “UX” and “UI” wheelhouses. And a user-testing/research wheelhouse, too. (Can you have three wheelhouses? Are they still wheelhouses? Yes, sometimes we do philosophical tangents, too.)</li></ul><div>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></h3><div>We build YNAB (or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands), the best budgeting software around. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.<br><br><br></div><div>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> Cultural Manifesto</a> has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong><br>Who you’d be working with:<br></strong><br><br></div><div><strong>Todd, </strong>our Chief Product Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—and knows that begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence <strong>and </strong>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.<br><br><br></div><div>And our product designers:<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Alan</strong> can be seen wearing many hats—and loving every second of it. He could be interviewing users one day and programming a prototype in Framer the next. He loves exploring ideas with teammates and lives for that rush when the team discovers a novel solution to a difficult problem. When he’s not busy designing, he’s probably either at Crossfit or working to improve his culinary skills... or contemplating the conflicts that occasionally arise between the two.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Andrea </strong>has spent a lengthy career knee-deep in interactive design. Today she finds great satisfaction in her dream job at YNAB where design and helping others converge—the perfect environment for empathic-driven design. After work, this compulsive doodler cherishes her time with her husband and kids. Soaking up live music, art, and setting sail on the occasional cruise are among her favorite to-dos.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Cindy </strong>sweats the small details when it comes to crafting simple, intuitive experiences. She loves having conversations with our users, and digs deep to find the root of their needs before exploring a solution. On most weekends (and some weekdays, depending on the daylight saving time), you can probably find her outdoors chasing sunrise and sunset with a camera in hand.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Dylan </strong>loves organizing design systems, obsessing over typographic details, and everything in between. Above his desk (ahem, kitchen table, it's a small apartment after all) sits an inconspicuous letterpressed card with Dieter Rams' 10 principles of good design on it. In his spare time he's probably taking photos or running—sometimes at the same time.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Emily</strong> is a design generalist, through and through. What she loves most about being a designer—besides the obvious draw of working with a team to build things people love—is how much there is to learn. Right now she's focused on honing her coding skills enough to be able to put up the occasional pull request as well as practicing the art of writing great microcopy. She enjoys reading books, cooking, biking, lifting weights, and spending time outdoors.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Kathryn</strong> loves to dig into problems and learn where things aren’t working, what people need, and how we can empower them to be even more amazing.&nbsp; And once she truly understands a problem, figuring out how to solve it is pretty fun. When she’s not at work, she can usually be found reading, conquering escape rooms, or hanging out with her family.<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></h3><div>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. In fact, we were recently recognized as <a href='https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune's #2 best small company to work for</a> in the United States! We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</div><div><strong><br>Live Where You Want<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too.&nbsp; Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</div><div><strong><br>No Crazy Hours<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</div><div><strong><br>Take Vacation (Seriously)<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our Slack channel, creatively named #office_wall</div><div><strong><br>The YNAB Meetup<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'> Costa Rica</a>, a <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and we most recently took over an entire hotel in Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</div><div><strong><br>Up Your Game<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>International is Absolutely Okay<br></strong><br><br></div><div>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</div><div><strong><br>If You’re Stateside…<br></strong><br><br></div><div>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)<br><br><br></div><div>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em><em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)<br><br><br></div><div><strong><br>Other Tidbits</strong></div><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp;</li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not <em>think</em> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.<br><br><br></div><h3>Now, back to you, our new Product Designer...</h3><div><strong>What Success Looks Like: <br></strong><br><br></div><div>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life changing financial control. No small thing, right? You’ll join our six product designers, working on both our web and mobile platforms. Throughout 2020, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB <em>effortless </em>and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience. You will also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users.<br><br><br></div><div>You’ll need to:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Understand the journey our users take, not just as they use our apps, but in the real world as they seek to take control of their financial lives.</li><li>Learn the design system, UI patterns, and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You have no problem designing a cross-platform feature for the web and mobile apps. You can clearly discern and navigate the relationship between the UI and the available data behind the scenes.&nbsp;</li><li>Solve design problems in a user-centric feedback loop. Research plays a big part in our design process so you’ll need to break down analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions. You’ll also follow up on the data gathered after the feature is released and continue to iterate and improve your designs until the data confirms success.&nbsp;</li><li>Shepherd your work from ideation to release. You will document your work for review with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders, make agreed-upon refinements, and will work with the developers on the upcoming feature. Design reviews during the development process examine form and function and you will see the feature through to the end.&nbsp;</li><li>Be comfortable iterating with low-fidelity designs and prototypes while working in cross-functional teams made up of developers, marketers, and customer-facing team members (waterfalls are for rivers!), while continuing to pursue a meticulous and thorough design.</li><li>Communicate and document the styling, user flows, and the impact of your designs on other parts of the system. You’ll update this documentation as feedback comes in and the apps evolve. On the flip side, you’ll provide feedback in design reviews that is clear and helpful in moving our products forward.</li><li>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done <em>in writing. </em>Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</li><li>Be comfortable writing a first pass at UI copy which is then refined with the help of your team in design reviews. There’s no lorem ipsum here.&nbsp;</li><li>You are comfortable speaking the language of software development. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!) to help implement your design work, that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement.</li><li>We use Figma for the vast majority of design work and maintaining our design system. You will aid in the expansion and maintenance of the design system and feel comfortable contributing new UI for our applications and website. If you have experience developing and maintaining design systems and can help us strike a balance between fighting for consistency and pushing the design system forward, that’s another plus.</li><li>Be comfortable talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing. You have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way to share with teammates.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem solving for both user and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our product: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…<br><br><br></div><div>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</div><h3><strong>How to Apply</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Apply below by 11:59PM on Oct 3rd, 2019.</strong> Firm. It’s a real deadline. Like, <em>after</em> it is too late.</li><li>Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:<ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.&nbsp;</li><li>We love a designer with a perspective. What’s yours? Feel free to touch on your beliefs on how design should be done, what it’s used for, or why it’s important.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Please include a portfolio that contains the following:&nbsp;<ul><li>Design work across web and mobile&nbsp;</li><li>Your design process (wireframes, interviews, architecture documentation)</li><li>Links to any live work.&nbsp;</li><li>Please state the role you played on each project.</li></ul></li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for.</li></ul><div>P.S.&nbsp; If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who might be, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!<br><br><br></div></div>",

We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal finance apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have experience in designing great interfaces and experiences for most of those platforms. More important, you’re a designer who views your job as that of problem solver. You come to the table not only with a knack for interaction design and love of logical UI patterns, but also with a deep empathy for people. We design our software to fit our users more than our fancy, and you love nothing more than digging through (or conducting!) research that leads the way in the design process. You’ve been around the block a few times and know what it means to design a mature, evolving product.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>You must have at least 3 years of experience working in product design&nbsp;</span><span>at a software company.</span><span>&nbsp;Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.</span></li><li><span>Experience in designing applications for both web and mobile (in your cover letter, please include the platforms for which you have designed and your level of experience with them).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>We are looking for a designer who has a strong background in UX and usability but who also can design UI independently. This is a truly mixed position where you will be responsible for activities traditionally held in the “UX” and “UI” wheelhouses. And a user-testing/research wheelhouse, too. (Can you have three wheelhouses? Are they still wheelhouses? Yes, sometimes we do philosophical tangents, too.)</span></li></ul><p><span>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>A Bit About Us</span></h3><p><span>We build YNAB (or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands), the best budgeting software around. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a><span>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></p><p><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;<span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span>&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;</span><em>click</em><span>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Who you’d be working with:</span></h4><p><span>Todd,&nbsp;</span><span>our Chief Product Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—and knows that begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</span></p><p><span>And our product designers:</span></p><p><span>Alan</span><span>&nbsp;can be seen wearing many hats—and loving every second of it. He could be interviewing users one day and programming a prototype in Framer the next. He loves exploring ideas with teammates and lives for that rush when the team discovers a novel solution to a difficult problem. When he’s not busy designing, he’s probably either at Crossfit or working to improve his culinary skills… or contemplating the conflicts that occasionally arise between the two.</span></p><p><span>Andrea&nbsp;</span><span>has spent a lengthy career knee-deep in interactive design. Today she finds great satisfaction in her dream job at YNAB where design and helping others converge—the perfect environment for empathic-driven design. After work, this compulsive doodler cherishes her time with her husband and kids. Soaking up live music, art, and setting sail on the occasional cruise are among her favorite to-dos.</span></p><p><span>Cindy&nbsp;</span><span>sweats the small details when it comes to crafting simple, intuitive experiences. She loves having conversations with our users, and digs deep to find the root of their needs before exploring a solution. On most weekends (and some weekdays, depending on the daylight saving time), you can probably find her outdoors chasing sunrise and sunset with a camera in hand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Dylan&nbsp;</span><span>l</span><span>oves organizing design systems, obsessing over typographic details, and everything in between. Above his desk (ahem, kitchen table, it’s a small apartment after all) sits an inconspicuous letterpressed card with Dieter Rams’ 10 principles of good design on it. In his spare time he’s probably taking photos or running—sometimes at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Emily</span><span>&nbsp;is a design generalist, through and through. What she loves most about being a designer—besides the obvious draw of working with a team to build things people love—is how much there is to learn. Right now she’s focused on honing her coding skills enough to be able to put up the occasional pull request as well as practicing the art of writing great microcopy. She enjoys reading books, cooking, biking, lifting weights, and spending time outdoors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kathryn</span><span>&nbsp;loves to dig into problems and learn where things aren’t working, what people need, and how we can empower them to be even more amazing.&nbsp; And once she truly understands a problem, figuring out how to solve it is pretty fun. When she’s not at work, she can usually be found reading, conquering escape rooms, or hanging out with her family.</span></p><h3><span>How You’ll Work at YNAB</span></h3><p><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. In fact, we were recently recognized as</span>&nbsp;<a href='https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune’s #2 best small company to work for</a><span>&nbsp;in the United States!</span>&nbsp;<span>We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></p><h5><span>Live Where You Want</span></h5><p><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too.&nbsp; Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></p><h5><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h5><p><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></p><h5><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h5><p><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;</span><em>minimum</em><span>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our Slack channel, creatively named #office_wall.</span></p><h5><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></h5><p><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;Costa Rica</a><span>, a&nbsp;</span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a><span>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and we most recently took over an entire hotel in Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></p><h5><span>Up Your Game</span></h5><p><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h5><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></h5><p><span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</span></p><h5><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h5><p><span>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;</span><em>and your family.</em><span>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</span></p><p><span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;</span><em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)</span></p><h5><span>Other Tidbits</span></h5><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas.</span></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;</span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not&nbsp;</span><em>think</em><span>&nbsp;that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span></li></ul><p><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</span></p><h3><span>Now, back to you, our new Product Designer…</span></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>What Success Looks Like:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life changing financial control. No small thing, right? You’ll join our six product designers, working on both our web and mobile platforms. Throughout 2020, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB&nbsp;</span><em>effortless&nbsp;</em><span>and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience. You will also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users.</span></p><p><span>You’ll need to:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>Understand the journey our users take, not just as they use our apps, but in the real world as they seek to take control of their financial lives.</span></li><li><span>Learn the design system, UI patterns, and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You have no problem designing a cross-platform feature for the web and mobile apps. You can clearly discern and navigate the relationship between the UI and the available data behind the scenes.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Solve design problems in a user-centric feedback loop. Research plays a big part in our design process so you’ll need to break down analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions. You’ll also follow up on the data gathered after the feature is released and continue to iterate and improve your designs until the data confirms success.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Shepherd your work from ideation to release. You will document your work for review with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders, make agreed-upon refinements, and will work with the developers on the upcoming feature. Design reviews during the development process examine form and function and you will see the feature through to the end.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable iterating with low-fidelity designs and prototypes while working in cross-functional teams made up of developers, marketers, and customer-facing team members (waterfalls are for rivers!), while continuing to pursue a meticulous and thorough design.</span></li><li><span>Communicate and document the styling, user flows, and the impact of your designs on other parts of the system. You’ll update this documentation as feedback comes in and the apps evolve. On the flip side, you’ll provide feedback in design reviews that is clear and helpful in moving our products forward.</span></li><li><span>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done&nbsp;</span><em>in writing.&nbsp;</em><span>Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable writing a first pass at UI copy which is then refined with the help of your team in design reviews. There’s no lorem ipsum here.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>You are comfortable speaking the language of software development. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!) to help implement your design work, that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement.</span></li><li><span>We use Figma for the vast majority of design work and maintaining our design system. You will aid in the expansion and maintenance of the design system and feel comfortable contributing new UI for our applications and website. If you have experience developing and maintaining design systems and can help us strike a balance between fighting for consistency and pushing the design system forward, that’s another plus.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing. You have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way to share with teammates.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem solving for both user and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our product: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</span></p><p><span>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</span></p><h3><span>How to Apply</span></h3><ul><li><span>Apply through the link below (or here:&nbsp;<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk03p1u' rel='nofollow'>https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk03p1u)</a>&nbsp;by 11:59PM on Oct 3rd, 2019</span><span>.</span>&nbsp;<span>Firm. It’s a real deadline. Like,&nbsp;</span><em>after</em><span>&nbsp;it is too late.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</span></li><ul><li><span>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>We love a designer with a perspective. What’s yours? Feel free to touch on your beliefs on how design should be done, what it’s used for, or why it’s important.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><li><span>Please include a portfolio that contains the following:&nbsp;</span></li><ul><li><span>Design work across web and mobile&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Your design process (wireframes, interviews, architecture documentation)</span></li><li><span>Links to any live work.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Please state the role you played on each project.</span></li></ul><li><span>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form.

We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;6m in venture funding from the most respected investors in technology and real estate. Our vision is to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed. The beginning of this journey is our online platform to help businesses rent, manage and share office space in London.</p><br /><p>As a product designer at Hubble, you will have the opportunity to add your magic to every stage of the design process. Working closely with product managers and tech leads, you will have the autonomy to conjure up functional yet delightful solutions to genuine user problems. All the while working towards business goals.</p><br /><p>Your role will of course include wire-framing, prototyping and spinning up high fidelity designs and assets but this is only a small part. Through user testing and internal feedback sessions, you will be responsible for continually testing ideas and assumptions and mixing your findings back into the designs. You will be able to use these findings to explain and defend your design rationale with the wider team and stakeholders. Excellent communication skills, explaining complex solutions in simple terms and the ability to challenge people in the wider team at all levels, backed with evidence, are all crucial.</p><br /><p>Strong visual UI design is a given, but beyond that you will be instrumental in following and helping to build out the Hubble design system. You will work closely with our engineers and regularly pair with them to help set the rules and ingredients for new design assets and components. A keen eye for detail is important but you should understand the trade-offs between striving for pixel-perfection against good enough to ship fast.</p><br /><p>You will possess a functional but creative mind and a no-fear attitude to your work. With a scientific approach to product design, don't be afraid to fail-fast and learn. You will feel empowered to push the needle, and suggest wildcard ideas that may make some colleagues squirm, but always be grounded in the possible. We build our products in an iterative, continuous deployment style, but as a designer you should always be thinking of where we want to be rather than just what's next.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>REQUIREMENTS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years experience in designing digital products.</li><br /><li>Fully proficient in designing for various screen sizes with a mobile first approach to responsive design.</li><br /><li>Solid understanding of UX design principles.</li><br /><li>Good understanding of atomic design and front end architecture.</li><br /><li>Expertise in the tools of the trade, sketch, invision etc. UI animations desirable but not required.</li><br /><li>Have the confidence to explain and defend design decisions to colleagues at all levels.</li><br /><li>Experience in mapping out user journeys and flows.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>&nbsp;</h2><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>BENEFITS</h2><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture.

    "content": "<div>The RoleRun organic and paid search for the Moment Shop, the largest online store for photography, filmmaking, and travel. The role is bigger than Moment the gear maker. It extends to the gear, apps, and photography trips we sell in the Moment Shop. This means supporting 20 different brands and making our store the place you shop before your next trip. On one side you'll be following the traditional role for search in making sure every article, trip, and product page is authoritative. This means managing both our organic and paid efforts to rank for the searches that matter. This also extends to multiple search boxes with Google, Amazon, Youtube, and iTunes to name a few. If people are searching for photography, filmmaking, and travel we want to win these searches. On the other side you get to work creatively with our content and commerce teams as they explore what content to publish and what products to sell. You will be collaborating with them from the beginning, using data to help them make better decisions.

You will have full autonomy of a cross-functional squad and will concoct a viable roadmap that mixes customer requirements (often poorly stated or not clearly known by customers themselves) with our vision, sales team feedback, product data and engineering team capabilities in order to build impactful products.</p><br /><p>Though your roadmap is never set in stone. You need to be comfortable in an experimental environment of flux and speed. You adapt to fluid circumstances as new information is learned and priorities change. And in this state of flux you are key to figuring out what not to build, bringing focus and steadiness to teams.</p><br /><p>To do all this, we believe that a great Product Manager is a clarifier, not a confuser. You need to be able to take complexity and distil out what really matters. You are clear-headed and comfortable making decisions on how to do less, not more. To you, less means cutting scope and not quality; constantly trying to find creative (and sometimes risky) solutions to seemingly unfathomable problems. Particularly in situations where data is lacking you must rely on qualitative user research in order to make this call, always with the end goal in mind.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, host monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years product related experience within a tech startup environment.</li><br /><li>Be comfortable managing stakeholders and distilling differing voices within a company.</li><br /><li>Have built a product roadmap that balances customer problems with business goals.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>Proficient with data; understanding what to measure and how.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture.

We are building Wethos Teams, a platform that enables independent specialists to join or form temporary micro-agencies to tackle larger, more complex initiatives.

We’re growing our business every month, we’re well-funded, and we’re investing heavily in our platform.</p><p><strong>Job description:</strong></p><p>We’re looking for a Lead Product Designer for the new Wethos Teams platform. Our goal is to provide an integrated set of scoping, networking, project delivery, and payment services that make it incredibly easy for remote, independent specialists to collaborate on teams together. The platform spans functional areas such as professional networking, client relationship management, project scoping and management, and billing. We believe that by removing barriers for clients (finding qualified teams) and freelancers (doing work with their existing networks and finding others to work with), we can unlock a tidal wave of opportunities that are normally reserved for full-service agencies.</p><p>For that to happen, our platform has to coordinate workflows across many parties, and do it in a way that is consistent, simple and rewarding. Projects can be chaotic and stressful – communication and visibility are critical. As our lead Product Designer, you will be building experiences that help people come together and collaborate, cut through the chaos, and provide transparency.

The incredibly competitive nature of the sports betting industry gave birth to a plethora of betting promotions to entice new and existing customers. These promotions allowed savvy gamblers to take advantage of markets using a risk-free match betting strategy. This business founded to educate this risk-free strategy to the less savvy betting customer as well as people that may have never placed a bet before by creating exceptional video content with clear and precise instructions. They began gaining lots of traction and built their subscriber base organically to highly profitable levels.</p> <p>The bedrock of their business is their own suite of software that identifies betting opportunities for their subscribers. The core of the software is their odds system, which downloads data for hundreds of bookmakers across thousands of events (resulting in millions of rows of data) and maps that data into a central database for other systems to utilise. This data is collected by way of APIs, XML feeds and Python Screen Scraping. The odds system and related tools are .NET applications written in C#.</p> <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p> <p>The software is complex and requires someone to manage it along with a team of 4 developers (Two Python, 1 full stack and 1 C# Developer.) That's where you come in. You will undertake a full audit of all existing tech processes and will assess ways to massively optimise systems and personnel; ensuring that the end product is flawless. This will involve a mixture of hands-on analysis / coding and guiding the team to deliver. You will be responsible for ensuring all software is able to deliver on commercial goals, whilst also ensuring the development of new systems and software to stay ahead of the curve.</p> <p><em>The successful candidate should have a strong blend of the below attributes:</em></p> <ul><li>Exemplary project management and leadership skills</li><li>Familiar with AGILE or other methodologies</li><li>NET (C#)</li><li>MS SQL Server</li><li>Python</li><li>NET Core</li><li>Knowledge of REST and Web APIs</li><li>MS SQL Server (Writing SQL and stored procedures)</li><li>Github</li><li>Windows Services</li><li>Database Expertise</li><li>Some interest or experience in the sports / betting industry would be preferred.</li></ul><p><strong>What will YOU need?</strong></p> <ul><li>Extensive experience of managing teams of developers, preferably in a sports/betting company or an online aggregator focused business.</li><li>Experience managing teams, recruiting talent, optimising software and bringing software to market.</li><li>Genuine excitement at the prospect of driving a major tech overhaul with a lack of red tape.</li></ul><p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p> <ul><li>Competitive Salary: Up to £110,000</li><li>Should you wish to have an office for the tech team or manage it fully remotely will be up to you. There would likely be a couple of team meetings per month if remote. Currently, the team reside in the midlands.</li><li>Senior decision-making tech role in a fast-growing UK business as it continues to educate and smarten consumers in the sports betting industry</li></ul><p>Please apply for a more detaileed conversation about the business.</p></div>",

We don’t care about A/B testing (<em>just yet</em>) but you do need to figure out what works and what doesn’t in Spain.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the Growth Team is distributed around the world, you should have very strong communication and organizational skills. Remote working experience is a bonus, but if you’ve never worked from home, that’s fine too. Finally, you should be fluent in Spanish and English.</div><div><br></div><div>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We are already a diverse bunch, but each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the job</strong></h3><div>We need you to help us launch Jobbatical operations in Spain and generate demand for our products and services.</div><div><br></div><div>Fundamentally, the role involves doing whatever it takes to generate demand and close customers in Spain. But not any customer. It has to be the right customer.</div><div><br></div><div>You are expected to take full ownership of revenue for Spain, and work hand-in-hand with our Tallinn HQ coming up acquisition efforts, and build, optimize and automate all operational growth processes.</div><div><br></div><div>On any given day you might:</div><ul><li>Orchestrate and execute our Account Based Marketing playbook, including <em>personalized </em>drip campaigns to our potential customers.</li><li>Respond to inbound inquiries, take sales calls (which are more like consultations, really) and send a proposal to a brand new potential client.&nbsp;</li><li>Launch a Google Ads campaign, from keyword research to copy and analysis.</li><li>Report on efforts and future plans to Tallinn HQ. Also, for the question about localizing the website to Spanish, just put that you read the entire application.</li><li>Work with the Spain Immigration Lead to write documentation on the Spanish Immigration process for content or future hires.</li><li>Analyze the performance of our Facebook Ads campaigns, and optimize for the best performing audience segments.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If all that sounds exciting, let’s keep going.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>Who you’ll be working with (and from where)</strong></h3><div>You’ll work primarily with (and report to) <strong>Gonz</strong>, our Head of Growth, to plan out growth efforts. He is based in Barcelona, but travels quite a bit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll also work with Maria, our Content Strategist, and Angie, our SDR. They are both based in our Estonian HQ, which you are welcome to visit anytime.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, you’ll be working hand-by-hand with our Immigration Lead in Spain. He is based in Madrid, and just joined our team. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As our Spanish Growth Manager, you’ll be (ideally) based in Spain but as long as you speak Spanish fluently and are familiar with business practices over there, we're good. Some travel to Spain might be required.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the pay and benefits</strong></h3><ul><li>Great compensation. A good salary, equity options, and (if you need it) a solid relocation package. Obviously.</li><li>Self-care budget. A budget for books, gym, and Uber rides for when you want to treat yourself to a night out.</li><li>Tools for the job. A computer, monitor, headphones, and other hardware you might need to work comfortably.</li><li>Time for yourself. 28 days of paid vacation, 3 mental health days a year, and generous parental leave.</li><li>Flexible Work. Work from home or in our spacious office in the coolest part of town.</li><li>Annual offsite in Tallinn. Karaoke included.</li></ul></div>",

Your role will be to build and maintain great relationships with a network of work spaces.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re therefore looking for an energetic people-person to help us build a strong network of workspaces that our customers can access through the Desana app.</p><br /><h2>People</h2><br /><p>Desana gives people access to a network of great work space when they want it, where they want it, through a single monthly subscription.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a growing startup based between London, Edinburgh, and Stockholm. We aim to become a globally relevant company by disrupting the way people think about, and access, the places they work. We're looking for the best people to join us on our journey.</p><br /><p>With prior experience in startups ourselves, we&rsquo;re keen to do things the right way from the very start. That&rsquo;s why we believe in openness and transparency in everything we do, from salary to communications, to processes.</p><br /><h2>Why Join Us?</h2><br /><p>We&rsquo;re at the forefront of the new wave of innovation in the office space sector which is already undergoing tremendous change and significant growth. Join us to not only grow the network of workspaces that are already changing the ways people work, but by living and breathing that transformation as you work flexibly, autonomously, and (as much as the job demands) remotely yourself. We pride ourselves in radical open-ness and strive to create a company that fulfils its users, partners, and employees.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2>The Role</h2><br /><h3><em>Growing the Workspace (supply) Network&nbsp;</em></h3><br /><p>We want to build a network that&rsquo;s genuinely valuable to our customers and the operators that we work with. To do that, we need someone that&rsquo;s motivated to: &nbsp;</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Increase the number of workspaces on the Desana platform each month across the UK.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Collaborate in the shaping and delivery of a scalable space onboarding and retention&nbsp; strategies - regular communication with workspaces on the network; in person, LinkedIn, by phone, by email, and through events.</li><br /><li>Maintain CRM to track relationships and opportunities.</li><br /><li>Create and deliver result orientated &ldquo;sprints&rdquo; (tasks) based on the company&rsquo;s 6 and 12 month goals.&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><h3><em>Communication</em></h3><br /><ul><br /><li>Working directly with team to incessantly improve brand and workspace onboarding experience / interaction.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Regular monitoring and updating of our task management system.</li><br /><li>Prepare weekly, monthly, quarterly meetings that effectively communicate data informed outcomes from onboarding strategies.</li><br /><li>Participate daily in a 10 minute whole team &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; call, wherever you are.</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>Industry Awareness&nbsp;</h3><br /><ul><br /><li>Consistently develop wider awareness of coworking industry trends; meticulous attention to specific triggers for workspace / operator types.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Be able to identify and respond to micro-indicators of change.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>About You</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>You have hospitality or related experience: If you&rsquo;ve worked in the coworking / flexible workspace industry or in a workspace brokering environment that would be advantageous (2-3 years preferably, but not critical to apply).&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have experience in sales: it would be great if you can bring experience in managing operational tasks in a sales/relationship management role.</li><br /><li>You can stay cool and deliver effectively: you have the ability to work to a deadline, prioritising workloads according to different criteria.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re data-driven: you understand growth metrics, A/B testing, and statistics and will use these skills to devise effective on-boarding strategies.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have CRM experience / awareness: particularly Hubspot. Not essential but would be really useful.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re personable: a fun, enthusiastic people-person. Ready to jump on the phone for a chat when appropriate.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re self-starting &amp; self-motivated: you&rsquo;re confident in your abilities, willing to take initiative, to take on your own responsibilities, and manage your own agendas and work scopes. Actively seek and respond to feedback.</li><br /><li>You can communicate diligently: you&rsquo;re able to understand the importance of maintaining regular communication with our team, our partners, and the workspace operators in our network. Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re never complacent: you strive to recognise that things can always be better than they currently are and have the confidence to present solutions to any weaknesses or inefficiencies that you see.</li><br /><li>You have a growth mindset: a desire to grow both personally and professionally.</li><br /><li>You have grit: the resilience and desire to work in a startup. You know when to seize the right opportunities in a fast-paced environment, while working to exceed the expectations of all market segments.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have a good network: if you have a good contact base in the UK coworking / property sector, that would be extremely useful but not essential.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Desana benefits</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Share options in the business.</li><br /><li>Flexible and remote work hours with a strong focus on work-life balance.</li><br /><li>e&rsquo;re establishing complete salary transparency across the company with clear progression paths.</li><br /><li>Team drinks, events, and trips.</li><br /><li>Free access to the app and our network of workspaces.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Think you&rsquo;re the right person for the role?

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. The Elastic family unites employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p>We’re looking to add a new Product Management node to the Elastic Product cluster.

Now we need you to take the next step.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the job</strong></h3><div>We need you to help us launch Jobbatical operations in Germany and generate demand for our products and services.</div><div><br></div><div>Fundamentally, the role involves doing whatever it takes to generate demand and close customers in Germany. But not any customer. It has to be the right customer.</div><div><br></div><div>You are expected to take full ownership of revenue for Germany, and work hand-in-hand with our Tallinn HQ coming up acquisition efforts, and build, optimize and automate all operational growth processes.</div><div><br></div><div>On any given day you might:</div><ul><li>Respond to inbound inquiries, take sales calls (which are more like consultations, really) and send a proposal to a brand new potential client.&nbsp;</li><li>Launch a Google Ads campaign, from keyword research to copy and analysis.</li><li>Send a <em>personalized </em>drip campaign to our potential customers.&nbsp;</li><li>Report on efforts and future plans to Tallinn HQ. Also, for the question about localizing the website to German, just put that you read the entire application.</li><li>Work with the German Immigration Lead to write documentation on the German Immigration process for content or future hires.</li><li>Analyze the performance of our Facebook Ads campaigns, and optimize for the best performing audience segments.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If all that sounds exciting, let’s keep going.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About you</strong></h3><div>You must have a strong entrepreneurial spirit, and you should’ve spent the last couple of years driving growth and sales at a small team, wearing multiple hats.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You could be an ex-startup founder, part of a startup’s founding team, or part of a Launch Team in a big company (think Rocket Internet, Uber, Deliveroo, Bolt, etc.)</div><div><br></div><div>You need to work independently, and be able to hit goals. Your <em>only</em> responsibility will be to work alongside our German Immigration Lead and drive new customers in our German operations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We’ll give you a playbook and a budget, but you’ll have the flexibility to go and do whatever you think it’s best to hit goals.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This means you’ll need a strategic vision, but on-the-ground execution and <em>some </em>combination of the following skills: personalized cold outreach at scale, sales, paid advertising, content marketing, SEO, copywriting, or marketing ops.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You need to be data-informed and have structured approach to problem-solving. We don’t care about A/B testing (<em>just yet</em>) but you do need to figure out what works and what doesn’t in Germany.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the Growth Team is distributed around the world, you should have very strong communication and organizational skills. Remote working experience is a bonus, but if you’ve never worked from home, that’s fine too. Finally, you should be fluent in German and English.</div><div><br></div><div>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We are already a diverse bunch, but each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>Who you’ll be working with (and from where)</strong></h3><div>You’ll work primarily with (and report to) <strong>Gonz</strong>, our Head of Growth, to plan out growth efforts. He is based in Barcelona, but travels quite a bit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll also work with Maria, our Content Strategist, and Angie, our SDR. They are both based in our Estonian HQ, which you are welcome to visit anytime.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, you’ll be working hand-by-hand with our Immigration Lead in Germany. He is based in Munich, and just joined our team. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As our German Growth Country Manager, you’ll be (ideally) based in Germany but as long as you speak German fluently and are familiar with business practices over there, we're good. Some travel to Germany might be required.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the pay and benefits</strong></h3><ul><li>Great compensation. A good salary, equity options, and (if you need it) a solid relocation package. Obviously.</li><li>Self-care budget. A budget for books, gym, and Uber rides for when you want to treat yourself to a night out.</li><li>Tools for the job. A computer, monitor, headphones, and other hardware you might need to work comfortably.</li><li>Time for yourself. 28 days of paid vacation, 3 mental health days a year, and generous parental leave.</li><li>Flexible Work. Work from home or in our spacious office in the coolest part of town.</li><li>Annual offsite in Tallinn. Karaoke included.</li></ul></div>",
