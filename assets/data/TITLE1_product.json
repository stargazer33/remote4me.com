We make it easy for developers to create fast, compelling websites without needing to become a performance expert. We are a VC-backed startup with a solid open source community (over 30,000 stars on Github). Our core values include transparency (we work in public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.</p><p>We provide full-time employees with full benefits including medical, dental, and vision coverage with available coverage for spouses or domestic partners and children, stock options, 401(k), generous holiday and sick paid time off, and 3 months of parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement.</p><p><strong>Details of this role:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Type of work:</strong> Full-time</li><li><strong>Start date:</strong> Immediately</li><li><strong>Location: Remote</strong></li><li><strong>The Role:</strong> Gatsby is looking for a marketing generalist who can manage marketing operations, plan events, and write copy. This is a hybrid role that requires knowledge about general marketing best practices and flexibility to jump in and help out as needed. This person should be flexible and enjoy working on a small and agile team. Work will include creating scalable processes that ensure best practices in lead generation and database management. You will also conduct data analyses that will be used to inform strategic decisions by stakeholders from across the company. You will be working in a fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects at once. Some event planning and content writing is required. You should know the principles of lead management and nurturing. Hubspot and Salesforce knowledge is a plus.</li></ul><p><strong>Why we’re hiring</strong></p><p>Gatsby is growing fast, and we’re building out the marketing team to support this growth. We need an agile marketing manager to join a small team that will embrace the sometimes chaotic and fast paced nature of a startup.</p><p><strong>What you’ll do on a day-to-day basis:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Marketing Automation</strong> Manage and build landing pages, lead capture forms, lists, and workflows in Hubspot. Salesforce knowledge is a plus.</li><li><strong>Event planning</strong> Organize events including sourcing venues, managing sponsorships, promoting, and capturing leads.</li><li><strong>Campaign Management</strong> Manage various campaigns to increase lead generation such as events, webinars, etc. Support these campaigns with landing pages, follow up emails, management of registration lists, etc.</li><li><strong>Scalable processes</strong> Establish and maintain scalable processes that ensure best practices in campaign and lead management.</li><li><strong>Reporting</strong> Create and maintain metrics reports in Salesforce on marketing activities, effectiveness, and business impact. Analyze marketing and sales data to develop insights and make recommendations on areas for optimization.</li><li><strong>Data Quality</strong> Monitor and maintain data quality within the marketing database.</li><li><strong>Marketing Systems</strong> Manage technical aspects of key marketing systems (marketing automation, CRM) used to generate, distribute, and report on leads.</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>Ideal candidate has experience working at a technology company and is familiar with website development tools</li><li>Strong analytical skills and experience with reporting and data analysis</li><li>Proficiency in marketing automation systems</li><li>Ability to manage multiple projects at the same time in a fast-paced environment</li><li>Technically capable, excellent communicator, and a desire to improve processes</li><li>Experience working with a Content Management System (Contentful) is a plus but not required</li></ul><p><strong>The best parts of this job</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll be at the cutting edge of website development — working at one of the fastest-growing website building frameworks on the market, learning about Gatsby’s innovative build system and modern tools such as Node, React, and GraphQL.</li><li>You’ll be part of a high-performing team at a VC-backed startup. The potential for growth and development is great.</li><li>You’ll get the chance to build something from the ground up. You set the priorities and determine the best way forward (with input from the team).</li><li>You’ll be working in a safe, open environment of talented marketers, engineers, and project managers who have a broad range of experience.</li></ul><p><strong>The worst parts of this job</strong></p><ul><li>We are still learning how to manage processes at scale, so things are a bit chaotic at times. We don’t have all our systems written down yet.</li><li>Startups like Gatsby are fast-paced and high energy which means we move quickly and adjust often. That might feel overwhelming at times.</li><li>You will likely have to chase someone down to get answers on occasion.</li><li>Because we’re all remote, it can be challenging to stay connected to the team.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.com/careers/marketing-manager/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We understand that hobbies exist and encourage our employees to pursue them. After joining you'll quickly find you have teammates that surf, sail, cycle, read (hardcovers!), tour the country in bands and festival hop - all while doing great work and exceeding expectations. Above all, we realize if you empower people to pursue their passions, they will help change the world.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive compensation, health benefits, 401K</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited paid time off (PTO) to pursue your passions</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team retreats - bi-annual retreats to share our successes together</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly ReCharge subscription</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment - we provide equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We’re searching for a&nbsp;<strong>Paid Advertising Specialist&nbsp;</strong>to help our team solve our clients’ biggest problem. If you’re looking for a position where you can&nbsp;<strong>set your own hours</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>take holidays as you see fit</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>work remotely from home or anywhere in the world</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>help medical research succeed</strong>, then please read on.</p><p>Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but a big part of what’s been achieved is due to new medications, medical devices and understanding developed through clinical research.</p><p><strong>Our clients</strong>&nbsp;academic researchers and medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials.</p><p><strong>Our company</strong>&nbsp;Trialfacts, removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients and volunteers they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</p><p><strong>We’re looking for someone who can:</strong></p><p><strong>Optimize&nbsp;</strong>You’ll be managing our Facebook campaigns from end to end, and expected to continuously run experiments and evaluate new strategies, processes and technologies to continuously improve performance and CPA. You’ll be expected to contribute to ongoing advertising process and systems improvement, to support reliable campaign performance forecasting, efficient campaign setup, and CPA improvement.</p><p><strong>Scale&nbsp;</strong>Very often our clients are under pressure to get volunteers as fast as possible. We need to be able to scale up our Facebook campaigns as and when they need us to, to not only match their demand but keep our CPAs well under control. This won’t always be easy, especially if we have been targeting a specific audience for a number of months. You’ll need to be creative and relentless in your efforts to satisfy our clients’ needs. \\</p><p><strong>Learn</strong>&nbsp;We’re looking for someone who’s driven to constantly update their advertising and optimization knowledge with the latest strategies and techniques. You’ll also need to rapidly develop an in-depth understanding of clinical trials and what it means to advertise for them on paid online channels. Unlike advertising for other products and services, you will be guided by strict ethical codes and guidelines, which at times, will require innovative problem-solving.</p><p><strong>Evolve&nbsp;</strong>We’re a growing business that is keen to increase our presence across popular advertising channels, such as Adwords, Instagram and Youtube. You will work with our Advertising Managers to identify the channels best suited to us and run experiments to quickly grow our expertise in these areas.</p><p><strong>What’s in it for you:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Autonomy</strong>&nbsp;We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a leave application process (you can take paid holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working.</li><li><strong>Innovation</strong>&nbsp;We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g. our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews, social media recruitment), and we’re constantly improving our service. We have developed a data-driven forecasting approach that provides predictability in a volatile industry. Our consistent, data-driven process has allowed us to be the first and only recruitment company to provide certainty to our clients via a money-back guarantee.</li><li><strong>Impact</strong>&nbsp;Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clientsresearchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practiceswork hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</li><li><strong>Growth</strong>&nbsp;– As a member of a small team you’ll be exposed to many areas of the business. You’ll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. You’ll be testing and implementing new marketing strategies. You’ll have access to courses and training programs of your choice, paid for by Trialfacts. Each quarter we’ll put in place a Development Plan to increase your skills, knowledge, experience, and responsibility.</li><li><strong>Opportunity</strong>&nbsp;– As a small and innovative team we’ve done away with outdated corporate thinking like the physical office, micromanaging and bureaucratic leave processes, but we haven’t thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We offer a stable salary + results-based compensation package, discretionary annual bonuses, annual salary review, a personal and tailored development plan, and the possibility to grow into positions of additional responsibility and leadership in the future. We’re growing rapidly and we’re excited to have someone join the team who will be focusing exclusively on optimization and scaling, and growing our presence on new advertising channels. We’re an innovative company in an industry ripe for disruption. The future looks optimistic as we continue to improve and expand on our core service. We apply the same innovative approach to patient advertising, and are always trying to improve our abilities, whether that’s through using platforms like Adespresso, exploring new channels or trying out different advertising mediums like video advertising.</li></ul><p><strong>This position is for you, if you:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Have Facebook ad experience –&nbsp;</strong>we’re all about learning on the job, however we would prefer someone who has previous experience in running campaigns on Facebook.</li><li><strong>Are great at synthesizing information</strong>&nbsp;– you’ll be analyzing vast amounts of data across multiple campaigns and funnel stages, so you’ll need to be at home with receiving a high volume of input, honing in on what’s important, and efficiently moving forward.</li><li><strong>Have a passion for testing and making data-driven decisions</strong>&nbsp;– there’s no doubt advertising requires a love of both data and testing. If you’re not comfortable with gathering, manipulating and interpreting data, and constantly testing everything, then please don’t apply.</li><li><strong>Love learning</strong>&nbsp;– we’re a team that’s driven by learning and improving. We’re looking for someone who wants to continuously learn and develop as a paid advertising specialist, grow as a person and constantly improve the service that we provide. If you’re not excited about learning and always taking that next course, then this position is not a good fit for you.</li><li><strong>Are highly organized</strong>&nbsp;– you’ll be managing campaigns for many different clients, while also testing, creating and setting up new campaigns, and always learning more. If you’re not highly organized and comfortable in a fast-paced environment then you’re unlikely a good-fit for this role.</li><li><strong>Are proficient in HTML &amp; CSS</strong>&nbsp;(any other coding languages are an asset) – Similar to the above, marketing today relies heavily on technology and automation. You don’t need any formal development experience but if you’re not comfortable with at least HTML &amp; CSS, please don’t apply. Similarly, if you’re not the kind of person that loves testing out new tools and technology, this position is not a good fit.</li><li><strong>Excel at written and spoken English</strong>&nbsp;– Being able to write well is a must for any Trialfacts position. Being in a remote team, you must also be great at communicating and comfortable sharing your thoughts – whether it be in Slack or during a team meeting on Zoom. At times you will even use screen share software (like Loom) to explain a concept or provide feedback.</li><li><strong>Are results-driven&nbsp;</strong>– you will be coached and guided, but ultimately you will be responsible for your performance which will directly impact your compensation.</li><li><strong>Are looking for a full-time position</strong>&nbsp;– we’re experiencing growth and we need someone who can fully commit to Trialfacts and get up to speed fairly quickly. We’re not looking for someone who wants to run their own part-time business or freelancing career on the side.</li></ul><p><strong>Here’s how to apply:</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in this position, then please email us at&nbsp;<strong>applications@trialfacts.com</strong>&nbsp;with the subject “Paid Advertising Specialist Application – [Your Name]” and tell us why we should consider you. Please also let us know how you heard about this position, and include in your application your current career goals and why you would like this position. Please also address where you think you’ll be located.&nbsp;<strong>Make sure you follow the instructions.</strong></p><p>Please note, you may find the application process differs a little from what you might expect. Although there will be phone interviews, an interview alone is a poor way to assess a candidate, so we’ll also be asking you to complete a few short tasks. These tasks are quick and designed to be fun and informative, but also to assess something about you. After each task we will let you know if you were successful in proceeding to the next round. If all goes well we’ll ask you to undertake a paid trial to see if there is a good fit, before making a final decision.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://trialfacts.com/paid-advertising-specialist' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

You communicate for a living and you know it, so you understand the language of development and design, marketing and support—and you do it well in all mediums, from face-to-face, to long-form, to comments in a Figma file.

(</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a><span>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'><span></span><span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span> has to really </span><em>click</em><span> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you! </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h2>Who you'd be working with:</h2></div><div><span>We’re talking product manager here, so you’d be working with a lot of different people. We can’t even list them all, really. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’ll be reporting to Todd, our Chief Product Officer. He obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—especially any magic to make YNAB simpler to adopt and more powerful in the long run, too. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence and very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>And as we said above, you’ll also cross paths with--well--probably everyone else. People like Buffy and Sebastian (a couple of our developers), Alan (a designer), and Angela (our Director of Customer Support). Also, our other new product manager, who we haven’t met yet, either.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h2>How You'll Work at YNAB</h2></div><div><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Live Where You Want</span></h4></div><div><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too. &nbsp;Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h4></div><div><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h4></div><div><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span><em>minimum</em><span> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></h4></div><div><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a><span>, a </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a><span> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on </span><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'><span>Laguna Beach</span></a><span>. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Up Your Game</span></h4></div><div><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, online courses and subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></h4></div><div><span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h4></div><div><span>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span><em>and your family.</em><span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span><em>your retirement</em><span></span><em>nest egg</em><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Other Tidbits</span></h4></div><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span><br></li><li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span><br></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span><br></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span><br></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span><br></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not </span><em>think</em><span> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span><br><br></li></ul><div><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. </span><span>You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success.</span><span> You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h2><span>Now, back to you, our new Product Manager...</span></h2></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div></div><div><h4><span>What Success Looks Like: </span></h4></div><div><span>At YNAB, our goal is for every user to achieve life-changing financial control. No small thing, right? In 2019, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB effortless and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience...Success means you get the best ideas and the best outcomes out of our cross-functional teams, and regularly ship real value to our users. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’ll also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users. We’ve been growing. A lot. And that means an evolving product structure—you’ll work closely with Todd, our CPO, and with another new-to-YNAB product manager to continue building that structure out, blending the best of who we are with who we can be. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>You’ll need to:</span></h4></div><div></div><ul><li><span>Understand the user journey, not just as they use our apps, but in the real world as they seek to take control of their financial lives.</span><br></li><li><span>Understand deeply that “cross-functional” isn’t code at YNAB for “designers and engineers.” We’ve doubled down on our best ideas coming from </span><em>anywhere</em><span>, and Support, Marketing, and Education are equal members of our flat product teams. </span><br></li><li><span>Along those lines, you’ll learn the design principles and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You’ll learn our engineering processes like the back of your </span><em>other</em><span> hand. Then you’ll find </span><em>another</em><span> hand or three for internalizing our brand, marketing strategies and support ethic.</span><br></li><li><span>Shepherd your team’s work from discovery to ideation to release to follow-up (because you know how much product work happens </span><em>after </em><span>release), documenting decisions the team has made along the way. In particular, you’ll work hand-in-hand with a product designer on your team to jointly develop vision, prioritize, and execute on strategy.</span><br></li><li><span>Synthesize and make sense of ALL THE DATA and information about our products, for yourself and to help others across the organization make better decisions. You’re fluent in quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis. </span><br></li><li><span>Be comfortable with multiple discovery techniques and strategies in your quest to make YNAB consistently better. You enjoy talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing. You have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way to share with teammates. </span><br></li><li><span>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done in writing. Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</span><br></li><li><span>You’re intensely curious. Period.</span><br></li><li><span>Oh, also, not to the exclusion of anything else, but you’re intensely curious about how people learn, how they change and develop habits, and how behavior inside a product might change behavior outside it.</span><br></li><li><span>You’re comfortable speaking the language of software development and product design. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!), that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement. Conversant across all disciplines is key.</span><br></li><li><span>Be a curious, persistent, and a quick learner, staying ahead of new ideas, technologies and other opportunities to help YNAB users take total control of their money, even sleep better at night.</span><br></li><li><span>Manage key partner relationships, from day-to-day communication to contract negotiation and management.</span><br></li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>Finally, your success as a product manager at YNAB hinges upon your ability to approach product development as holistic simultaneous problem solving of both user and business goals. We work collaboratively here so you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our users: It is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h2><span>How to Apply</span></h2></div><ul><li><span>Apply here (https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9pz)&nbsp;by 11:59PM on </span><span>June 23rd, 2019. Firm. </span><span>It’s a real deadline. Like, after it is too late.</span><br></li></ul><ul><li><span>Attach a pdf of your cover letter.

We have developed a market-leading digital platform, secured funding from top-tier investors, and signed contracts with a variety of global corporations… but we’re just getting started. <br /><br />We have humongous plans –and need lots of help in achieving them– which is why we’re looking for an exceptional individual to join as our first content person to lead Unmind’s content marketing efforts moving forward.<br /><br />About Unmind <br />Unmind is a workplace mental health platform – providing clinically-backed tools, training, and assessments that anyone can use to proactively improve their mental wellbeing. Our digital platform is beautifully designed, non-stigmatising and globally scalable – helping to create healthier, happier, more human organisations around the world.<br /><br />We believe that everyone has the right to a healthy mind –because we all have mental health, all of the time– and we’re striving to create a world where mental health is universally understood, nurtured, and celebrated.<br /><br />The Role – Content Marketing Manager<br />As a team of thirty-six, everyone does a bit of everything and we’re a SUPER flat organisation –all opinions are valued regardless of role, tenure or background– so every aspect of the business is up for debate. That said, the core remit of this particular role is to:<br /><br />Lead our content strategy, driving customer acquisition, activation and retention.<br />Fully conceptualise, write, and edit engaging content.<br />Leverage our existing relationships - clients and contributors - to add credibility.<br />Craft and own our tone of voice.<br />Ensure quality and consistency across different channels including online and events.<br />Ensure that all efforts are highly organised and systematically tracked.<br />Refine our schedule to align with key events, new research and product launches.<br />Optimise your output, considering SEO and Google Analytics.<br />Work with Design, Client Success and Sales to identify opportunities and deliver your vision.<br />Contribute to our wider communications strategy inc. PR relationships etc.<br />Grow Unmind into a global thought leader that is truly loved!<br /><br />Responsibilities<br />We are looking for someone to lead Unmind’s content marketing activities. To-date most of our content has been written by different members of the Unmind team, but we feel that now is the right time to scale our efforts, professionalise our approach, and grow Unmind into a global thought leader.<br /><br />This role will require working incredibly closely in collaboration with our Head of Marketing as well as our Sales and Client Success teams to ensure we are always aligned and working towards the same overarching objectives. The successful candidate will be extremely bright, unwaveringly candid, and bring oodles of insight to the table. If you’re ambitious, creative and articulate, then this is an opportunity to oversee all-things content marketing at a fast-growth, high-impact startup. <br /><br />Here’s how your skills and passion will come to life at Unmind:<br /><br />Build: Design, develop, and deliver Unmind’s content marketing strategy. This will include (but is not limited to): content creation and deployment; tone of voice and positioning; optimising SEO and discoverability whilst tracking progress.<br />Redefine: Transform the world’s perception of mental health. Unmind is changing the landscape of mental healthcare, and your input will play an enormous role in how we achieve that. You will need to create effective content that elevates the subject whilst ensuring that we always uphold our core values.<br />Collaborate: Harness the kaleidoscope of personal stories and professional expertise from across the Unmind team to inspire others around our mission/vision/purpose. Work with our phenomenal clients, users and collaborators to leverage their shared passion, testimonials, and insights around improving workplace mental health.<br />Implement: Instill analytics and reporting around all content initiatives to enhance business predictability and transparency. Help define, track and manage company KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) associated with content marketing. <br />Reflect: Review all content and communication activity to-date, retrospectively looking for opportunities or improvements that will enhance efficiency/effectiveness. Compile periodic reporting and insights from ongoing content efforts to aid internal planning and enhance our collective understanding of what is/isn’t striking a chord with the market. <br />Partner: Proactively connect with early-adopters, industry experts, and thought-leaders within the market to ensure that our messaging is always striking the right chord.<br />Grow: We love working with people who are naturally curious and always seek opportunities to learn. We have a hugely experienced team but none of us think we are the finished article. You shall expect to be challenged and to challenge others internally. We are striving to create something truly special so egos need to be left at the door.<br /><br /><br />Skills and Experience<br />As with any B2B organisation, the success of Unmind depends on every member of staff being professional, amicable, and building strong relationships – both internally and with external stakeholders. Our ideal candidate traits are as follows:<br /><br /><br />ESSENTIAL: <br /><br />3+ years of content marketing experience – ideally within a tech-led enterprise environment.<br />Experience building a successful B2B enterprise content marketing strategy. <br />Ability to leverage a network of clients/experts/ambassadors.<br />A love for storytelling, and a natural ability to engage customers and prospects.<br />Exceptional writing, editing, and verbal communications skills.<br />Excellent editorial and copywriting abilities, including long form and short form content.<br />Ability and willingness to source knowledge and research topics independently.<br />Understand the B2B marketing funnel, including the customer's journey.<br />Creative, innovative and have an eye for detail.<br />Autonomous attitude (you *do not* require (or like) micro-management).<br />An ability to simplify, communicate, and sell ideas to multiple groups of stakeholders, with a relentless enthusiasm to over-deliver on targets and expectations.<br />Bona. Fide. Hustler. If it needs doing, you’ll get it done - somehow, some way.<br />Hungry to make Unmind the global category leader within workplace mental health.<br />Not a terrible human being… Ideally a great one. We’re a tight team and want to stay that way.<br /><br />DESIRED:<br />Passion for mental health, tech-for-good, and generally improving people’s lives.<br />Prior role(s) within a B2B SaaS environment and/or HR Tech experience.<br />Previous startup and/or entrepreneurial experience (inc. being innovative with resources!)<br />Comfortable working for a small, rapid growth business with constant change/unknowns.<br />Bonus points for expertise in video production, graphic design, or website management.<br />Passionate about design, UX and beautiful brands.<br /><br />The Opportunity<br />You will be joining an exceptionally talented core team who –in the last 24-months– have secured incredible investors, partners, clients and advocates. Our future success(es) will rely on the continuation of that momentum – of which our ability to enhance (and leverage) Unmind’s market presence will be paramount. If done right, then the opportunity for this individual (and Unmind generally) is vast, compounded and –perhaps most importantly– will genuinely improve people’s lives.<br /><br />Location: Unmind’s London office (London Bridge / Borough)<br /><br />Benefits<br />Great colleagues (personally and professionally) <br />Pick your own tech<br />Regular social company gatherings <br />Optional team walks, runs and mindfulness sessions <br />Wellbeing budget to use at your discretion <br />Office perks (free on-site gym, rooftop bar, wellbeing events)<br />A culture of continuous learning <br />Pension and generous holiday policy <br />Dog-friendly workplace<br /><br />Hours: Regular 09:00–18:00 working day (with capacity for remote working and flexible hours). <br /><br />Remuneration: Salary TBC - reflective of candidate experience and skill set.",

It's a webpage that showcases a particular category of products; for this project, it would be things like mason jars, amber glass bottles, or childproof pharmaceutical packaging. Our job is to write copy that will appear at the top of bottom of the page to help shoppers learn about the products: what they are, general features and/or benefits, what they need to know when making a purchase, etc.</p><p>What's a product description? It's website copy that describes a specific product. It's generally broken up into paragraph copy and 3-5 bullets. Its purpose is to introduce a shopper to the product's particular features and benefits. Unlike category page content that might focus on amber glass jars in general, a product description will focus on a specific product, such as a 4-ounce straight-sided amber glass jar.</p><p>We have a full style guide available that explains everything more clearly and can answer any questions you have, so don't worry if you're unsure or confused about what we're looking for.</p><p>We need people who:</p><p>-- Are fluent in English as their first language<br>-- Have experience writing and/or editing ecommerce copy (SEO experience a plus!)<br>-- Can follow instructions<br>-- Can positively accept and apply feedback<br>-- Can stick to deadlines<br>-- Will only submit unique content<br>-- Can and are willing to do research when required<br>-- Can accept payment via PayPal on a weekly basis</p><p>If you have the time and ability to help, please reach out ASAP.

    "content": "About movemeon<br /><br />We’re a fast growing, tech-enabled, central London based growth business. We were founded with the simple aim to make discovering great jobs easier. <br /><br />Today Movemeon is used by 35,000+ members, 2,500+ businesses (from the likes of Uber and Apple to early stage VC-backed startups) and in 100+ countries. ~200 candidates and ~15 businesses join the membership every week. We deliver them unique opportunities, insight and events through an exclusive members network.<br /><br />We are also planning to expand fast into new geographies and new professional niches as well as exploring exciting new products like payspective.com. It’s all go!<br /><br />We can take you through our vision when we meet you. Suffice to say, we are thinking big and need your help to execute. <br /><br /><br />The team<br /><br />The two founders, Nick Patterson and Richard Rosser set-up movemeon after their frustration with recruitment agencies. We are now a team of 16 and are highly international (French, Italian, Portuguese, German). We’re continuing to expand and expect a steady flow of new joiners this year. Our office is near Vauxhall (central London) in a complex also home to other growth businesses. <br /><br />About the Product manager role<br /><br />We are looking for someone to take our product to the next level. It’s an opportunity to be hands-on and take as much responsibility as you can handle, managing our developers and participating in the creation of the product vision/ roadmap from day one. <br /><br />Your key responsibilities will include:<br />•    Understanding our users: speak to our customers and understand what they like, and what frustrates them. Use this intelligence, plus feedback collated from the team, to understand what we need to build as a priority.<br />•    Managing the product roadmap: You’ll be working with our head of product to understand how the product can be optimized for each function (in addition to the user priorities). You’ll participate in the creation of the product roadmap, prioritizing the ongoing delivery of highest impact changes. You will also communicate progress against this roadmap to the broader team: putting you at the centre of the business<br />•    Owning our email: You’ll be the owner of all the automatic emails that come from our site and will be in charge of their optimisation<br />•    Running the sprint process: You’ll help the teams to develop great technical and design specifications for the developers to work towards. You’ll then lead a team of two back-end developers (offshore) to deliver against these specifications. You will have responsibility for improving the process/ managing the contract with the developers to ensure they are delivering to our standards<br />•    Identifying high-impact UX changes: we want you to be consistently updating the look and feel of the site. You will be expected to regularly use the site as a “user” and see what frustrates you<br />•    Measure and iterate: Measure the impact of the changes we make, and use the results to inform further product changes. We measure the impact of pretty much everything we do. So you’ll get to see (and analyse) plenty of interesting data that will show just how much your hard work is contributing to the growth of the business. <br /><br />What the right candidate will bring to the table<br /> <br />We’re looking for someone with coding experience (PHP and HTML) or a degree in computer science. Strong problem solving and logic, as well as analytics, are great for any product role. <br /><br />Specifically we’re looking for:<br />•    Knowledge of PHP and HTML/ degree in computer science<br />•    Evidence that you are a 'do-er' (yes, thinking is important but lots of stuff needs to get done). You’ll be proactive and demonstrate that you get stuck in, organize things and have probably always had holiday jobs / part time work etc.<br />•    Super organized – we are growing fast which means things change regularly and can be chaotically busy. You’ll need to keep a clear head and religiously get through your to do list. <br />•    Entrepreneurship in your DNA – you never fancied / tried but got frustrated with a corporate job.<br />•    Desire to take on responsibility quickly. As MMO grows, we’ll want you to grow with us. So that means quickly stepping up to manage more aspects of the business and potentially more people too.<br />•    Minimum of a 2:1 degree from a UK Russell Group (or international equivalent) university<br />•    Fluent written and spoken English<br />•    Fun team member (we have lots of it)<br /> <br /> <br />So if this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you (see details below). <br /><br />About our offer:<br /><br />•    Exciting business in a time of rapid growth<br />•    Start-up environment and ethos (i.e. we don’t do face time and we don’t do anything that doesn’t need to be done)<br />•    Respect for and encouragement of your own ideas and initiatives<br />•    Real responsibility<br />•    Fun, smart team of normal people<br />•    A sensible work life balance (we leave the office by 6pm every day and don’t work weekends)<br />•    Monthly team fun & annual away weeks (like last year’s trips to Montenegro and Barcelona)<br />•    An office in central SW London (we’re based near Vauxhall tube)<br />•    25 days holiday + 2 extra days at Christmas<br />•    Competitive salary & quarterly bonus related to metrics you can track and control<br />",

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. The Elastic family unites employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p>We’re looking to add a new Product Management node to the Elastic Product cluster.

Wir sind inhabergeführt, nicht fremdfinanziert und haben <strong>spannende Unternehmenskunden</strong> in fast 30 Ländern.</p><p>Wir sind der Überzeugung, dass Micromanagement tödlich ist für Kreativität und Produktivität. Wir bieten eine <strong>offene Arbeitskultur</strong>, in der die Mitarbeiter ihren Arbeitsort frei wählen können und sich den Tag selbst einteilen.</p><p>Wir entwickeln Software für die Unternehmens-IT, weil wir den Markt kennen und die Bedürfnisse von Fachabteilungen und Mitarbeitern verstehen. Wir wissen, wie IT-Profis arbeiten und welche Werkzeuge sie verwenden. Wir wissen auch, wie komplex ein großer Teil der Unternehmenssoftware ist. Wir wollen dazu beitragen, dass sich das ändert.</p><p>Unser Produkt uberAgent bietet tiefe Einsichten in <strong>User Experience</strong> and Anwendungsperformance von physischen PCs und virtuellen Desktops. Mit Hilfe dieser Informationen optimieren unsere Kunden die Geschwindigkeit, Sicherheit und Stabilität der Endgeräte ihrer Mitarbeiter.</p><p>Die Kombination aus <strong>einfacher Bedienung</strong> und wertvollen Metriken macht uberAgent zu einem Produkt, mit dem sehr gerne gearbeitet wird. Insofern passt es perfekt zu Splunk, einer leistungsfähigen und gleichzeitig benutzerfreundlichen Big Data-Plattform, die von uberAgent für Datenspeicherung und -visualisierung verwendet wird.</p><p><strong>Deine Aufgaben</strong></p><p><strong>Wir leben Qualität.</strong> Bei uns gibt es keine Deadlines, keinen Stress, keinen Termindruck. Du bleibst „im Flow“ und machst das, was Du am besten kannst: großartige Software schreiben.</p><p>Du bist federführend für die Portierung unseres Endpoint Agent von Windows nach macOS verantwortlich. Zusammen mit Kollegen analysierst Du dazu im ersten Schritt den vorhandenen modernen C++1x Code. Anschließend optimiert ihr die Plattformunabhängigkeit. Im dritten Schritt geht es dann an die Erstellung des neuen Agents für macOS auf Basis eines gemeinsamen plattformunabhängigen Layers.</p><p><strong>Das wünschen wir uns</strong></p><p>Die einzigen Qualifikationen, die uns wirklich wichtig sind, sind der Drang, das bestmögliche Resultat zu erzielen und der Wunsch, jeden Tag etwas dazuzulernen.</p><p>Daneben erwarten wir:</p><ul><li>Begeisterung für Softwareentwicklung</li><li>Sehr gute Kenntnisse in C++</li><li>Sehr gute Kenntnisse in systemnaher Entwicklung unter macOS</li><li>Eigenständiges Arbeiten</li><li>Hang zur Perfektion</li><li>Sehr gute Deutsch- und Englischkenntnisse</li><li>Hauptwohnsitz in Deutschland</li></ul><p>Zusätzlich freuen wir uns über:</p><ul><li>Erfahrungen mit Unternehmens-IT (um unsere Kunden besser verstehen zu können)</li><li>Community-Engagement, Bloggen, Mitarbeit an freier Software (bitte schicke uns Links zu Projekten)</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/201352?reset=False&amp;ra=15wGCjKX3N6M&amp;oqs=a%3D15wGCjKX3N6M' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About vast limits GmbH</h3>            <div><p>Unsere Software wird von Mittelständlern mit tausenden bis hin zu globalen Konzernen mit hunderttausenden PC-Arbeitsplätzen eingesetzt.

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. The Elastic family unites employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p>The Observability team is in charge of developing solutions that focus on application developers and engineers that run infrastructure and services supporting these applications. Elasticsearch is an efficient datastore for logs, metrics, and application traces, supporting the three pillars of observability. The Observability team builds and maintains solutions that make getting insights from this data turnkey and efficient, such as our APM, Infrastructure Monitoring, and Logs solutions.

And yes, pajamas are totally a productivity enhancer.</li><li>We believe flexibility is a two-way street. Yes, we have the freedom to adjust our schedule whenever there’s not a meeting, but we’re also available when a teammate runs into a problem or there’s an urgent issue, even when it’s not during our normal hours.</li><li>We believe in peace and quiet. No politics, no drama, no needless meetings, no distracting our teammates. Instead, we create a space where everyone can focus, and in that space, we do the deep work that really matters.</li><li>We believe in doing what’s right for our customers, even when it’s painful<strong>.</strong> Sometimes that means offering a refund when it’s against policy, giving them a bit of free coaching, or referring them to another company that can serve them better. It may not be convenient, it may not be profitable, but it’s right, and that’s all that matters.</li></ol><p><strong>How to apply:</strong></p><p>The interview process begins with an online application</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://smartblogger.com/marketing-automation-specialist-2' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We’re searching for a <b>Paid Advertising Specialist</b> to help our team solve our clients’ biggest problem. If you’re looking for a position where you can set your own hours, take holidays as you see fit, work remotely from home or anywhere in the world, and help medical research succeed, then please read on. </div><div><br></div><div><span>Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but a big part of what’s been achieved is due to new medications, medical devices and understanding developed through clinical research.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Our clients</b></span><span> – academic researchers and medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Our company</b></span><span> – Trialfacts removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients and volunteers they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</span></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><b>We're looking for someone who can:</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Optimize</b></span><span>— You’ll be managing our Facebook campaigns from end to end, and expected to continuously run experiments and evaluate new strategies, processes and technologies to continuously improve performance and CPA. You’ll be expected to contribute to ongoing advertising process and systems improvement to support reliable campaign performance forecasting and efficient campaign setup.</span><span><br></span></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Scale</b></span><span>— Very often our clients are under pressure to get volunteers as fast as possible. We need to be able to scale up our Facebook campaigns as and when they need us to, to not only match their demand but keep our CPAs well under control. This won’t always be easy, especially if we have been targeting a specific audience for a number of months. You’ll need to be creative and relentless in your efforts to satisfy our clients’ needs.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Evolve</b></span><span>— We’re a growing business that is keen to increase our presence across popular advertising channels, such as Adwords, Instagram and Youtube. You will work with our Recruitment Manager to identify the channels best suited to us and run experiments to quickly grow our expertise in these areas.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Learn</b></span><span>— We’re looking for someone who’s driven to constantly update their Facebook advertising and optimization knowledge with the latest strategies and techniques. You’ll also need to rapidly develop an in-depth understanding of clinical trials and what it means to advertise for them on paid online channels. Unlike advertising for other products and services, you will be guided by strict ethical codes and guidelines, which at times, will require innovative problem-solving.</span><span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>What’s in it for you:</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Autonomy</b></span><span> — We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a leave application process (you can take paid holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our team is remote (we communicate via</span><a href='https://slack.com/' rel='nofollow'><span></span><span>Slack</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://basecamp.com' rel='nofollow'><span>Basecamp</span></a><span> and video conferencing software). We set our own hours based on what works for us and our clients. As long as you have a good internet connection you can work from wherever in the world you choose.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Innovation</b></span><span> — We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g. our</span><a href='https://trialfacts.com/#advantages-5' rel='nofollow'><span></span><span>phone screening appointment system</span></a><span>,</span><a href='https://trialfacts.com/#advantages-3' rel='nofollow'><span></span><span>researcher interviews</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://trialfacts.com/does-social-media-recruitment-make-sense-for-my-clinical-trial/' rel='nofollow'><span>social media recruitment</span></a><span>), and we’re constantly improving our service. We have developed a data-driven forecasting approach that provides predictability in a volatile industry. Our consistent, data-driven process has allowed us to be the first and only recruitment company to provide certainty to our clients via a money-back guarantee.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We apply the same innovative approach to patient advertising, and are always trying to improve our abilities, whether that’s through using platforms like Adespresso, exploring new channels or trying out different advertising mediums like video advertising.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Impact</b></span><span> — Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clients—researchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practices—work hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Growth</b></span><span> — As a member of a small team you'll be exposed to many areas of the business. You'll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. We’ll encourage you to test out new onboarding and client education strategies. You'll have access to courses and training programs of your choice, paid for by Trialfacts. Each quarter we’ll put in place a Development Plan to increase your skills, knowledge, experience, and responsibility. </span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Opportunity</b><b></b>— As a small and innovative team we’ve done away with outdated corporate thinking like the physical office, micromanaging and bureaucratic leave processes, but we haven’t thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We offer a stable salary + results-based compensation package, discretionary annual bonuses, annual salary review, a personal and tailored development plan, and the possibility to grow into positions of additional responsibility and leadership in the future. </div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re growing rapidly and we're excited to have someone join the team who will be focusing exclusively on optimization and scaling, and growing our presence on new advertising channels. We're an innovative company in an industry ripe for disruption. The future looks optimistic as we continue to improve and expand on our core service.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>This position is for you if you:</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><ul><li><b>Have Facebook ad experience</b> - we're all about learning on the job, however we would prefer someone who has previous experience in running campaigns on Facebook. </li><li><span><b>Are great at synthesizing information</b></span><span> - you’ll be analyzing vast amounts of data across multiple campaigns and funnel stages, so you’ll need to be at home with receiving a high volume of input, honing in on what’s important, and efficiently moving forward. </span></li><li><span><b>Have a passion for testing and making data-driven decisions</b></span><span> - there’s no doubt advertising requires a love of both data and testing. If you’re not comfortable with gathering, manipulating and interpreting data, and constantly testing everything, then please don’t apply. </span></li><li><b>Love learning</b> - we're a team that's driven by learning and improving. &nbsp;We're looking for someone who wants to continuously learn and develop as an Optimisation specialist, grow as a person and constantly improve the service that we provide. If you’re not excited about learning and always taking that next course, then this position is not a good fit for you. </li><li><b>Are highly organized</b> - you'll be managing campaigns for many different clients, while also testing, creating and setting up new campaigns, and always learning more. If you're not highly organized and comfortable in a fast-paced environment then you're unlikely a good-fit for this role. </li><li><b>Are proficient in HTML &amp; CSS</b><b> (any other coding languages are an asset)</b> - Similar to the above, marketing today relies heavily on technology and automation. You don’t need any formal development experience but if you’re not comfortable with at least HTML &amp; CSS, please don’t apply. Similarly, if you’re not the kind of person that loves testing out new tools and technology, this position is not a good fit. </li><li><b>Excel at written and spoken English</b> - Being able to write well is a must for any Trialfacts position. Being in a remote team, you must also be great at communicating and comfortable sharing your thoughts - whether it be in Slack or during a team meeting on Zoom. At times you will even use screen share software (like Loom) to explain a concept or provide feedback. </li><li><span><b>Are results-driven</b></span><span> - you will be coached and guided, but ultimately you will be responsible for your performance which will directly impact your compensation.</span></li><li><span><b>Are looking for a full-time position</b></span><span> - we’re experiencing growth and we need someone who can fully commit to Trialfacts and get up to speed fairly quickly. We’re not looking for someone who wants to run their own part-time business or freelancing career on the side.</span></li></ul><div><span></span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><b>Summary</b></div><div><br></div><div><span></span></div><div><span>Yes, this position description is so long that it needs a summary! Here are the facts: &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Set your own hours</b>: Choose when and how you work, but there needs to be some flexibility to have training and meetings with our Operations Manager, Jess, and the rest of the team. This is a full-time position. </li><li><b>Work remotely</b>: We’re a virtual team located around the globe. You can live anywhere or travel with this position. You will need a reliable internet connection. </li><li><b>Results-based environment</b>: You’ll be evaluated based on your results. You will not be micromanaged, but you need to be effectively onboarding clients, increasing the number of studies that meet their enrolment goals and nurturing repeat business from our major clients. </li><li><b>Commitment to learning</b>: We believe in continuous improvement and growth. You’ll be mentored, guided, and trained by our Operations Manager, Jess and team. External resources, courses and training programs paid for by Trialfacts. </li><li><b>Contribute something meaningful to the world</b>: We make a lot of medical research possible that would otherwise fail, and remove the #1 headache faced by researchers in a predictable and reliable manner, backed by our money-back guarantee. </li><li><b>Trial period</b>: There will be an initial paid trial period typically lasting 2-3 weeks, but it’s possible it might be longer. Typically, there are 3-4 candidates participating in the trial period. </li><li><b>Compensation</b>: Compensation will be a monthly salary plus performance-based compensation package. Salaries are reviewed annually. </li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>Interested in making a difference with us? Here’s how to apply</b>:</span></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>If you're interested in this position, then please email us at applications@trialfacts.com with the subject “Paid Advertising Specialist Application – [Your Name]” and tell us why we should consider you. Please also let us know how you heard about this position, and include in your application your current career goals and why you would like this position. Please also address where you think you’ll be located.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Please note, you may find the application process differs a little from what you might expect. Although there will be phone interviews, an interview alone is a poor way to assess a candidate, so we’ll also be asking you to complete a few short tasks. These tasks are quick and designed to be fun and informative, but also to assess something about you. After each task we will let you know if you were successful in proceeding to the next round. If all goes well, we’ll ask you to undertake a paid trial to see if there is a good fit, before making a final decision.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div></div>",

    "content": "We're looking for a growth marketing focussed Co-Founder to join Nettle and help disrupt the affiliate & influencer marketing industries from the ground up.<br /><br />* Have you got the entrepreneurial drive?<br /><br />* Are you passionate about startups? <br /><br />* Are you ready to drive growth and help build a fast-growing company with impact?<br /><br />Does this sound like you? <br /><br />If so, we want *you*. <br /><br />-------------<br /><br />*What is Nettle?* <br /><br />At Nettle we pay you for the everyday recommendations you make to your friends.<br /><br />We all make recommendations to our friends that businesses value highly, but we don't always see that value ourselves.<br /><br />While running traditional customer referral campaigns, businesses are restricted by their existing user base. We found that people don’t need to have used a product to be happy to recommend it for a reward. In this way, businesses are missing out on non-customer referrals as a rich source of new customers.<br /><br />Nettle’s solution is a platform which enables users to earn cash while recommending (currently) ethical products to their friends. This in turn enables businesses to gain access to new customers at a set acquisition cost via non-customer referrals.<br /><br />The current focus on ethical products addresses the fact that many of us are aware of environmental social issues and would like to do more to change consumption for the better but lack enough incentive & information to do so currently.<br /><br />The vision for Nettle is to disrupt the traditional affiliate & influencer industries by taking referral commission away from 'the algorithm' and putting it back into the pocket of the individual.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />*Where We’re At?*<br /><br />We’ve been revenue generating since the first day our web-based MVP was soft launched a few months ago.<br /><br />We’re now preparing to raise seed capital to accelerate our growth, develop the product & grow the team. <br /><br />While we prepare for this we continue to push this out to more users to gather valuable feedback, develop the product and drive revenue growth.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />*The Role*<br /><br />We are looking for someone to join as a cofounder focussed on marketing & partnerships in this early stage in Nettle’s journey.<br /><br />The nature of cofounding at this stage demands a more open & agile approach than the traditional job description offers. <br /><br />As a cofounder you will have responsibilities ranging every aspect of the business and its future development.<br /><br />This being said, one of the key focuses will be on powering growth marketing efforts to rapidly grow our user base while developing partnership with brands, publishers & affiliates.<br /><br />It is a hands-on role and you will need to be able to develop & implement a marketing strategy end to end.<br /><br />You would join the current full-time founder Edley, a small advisory board & occasional part-time/freelancers working out of a co-working hub near Old Street tube station in London.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />_Applicants must be:_ <br />* Driven & independent with a &quot;growth mindset&quot;:https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/ - do you thrive when faced with new problems? <br />* Passionate about entrepreneurship & early-stage startups<br />* A confident communicator who can sell an idea<br /><br />_We prefer applicants that:_<br />* Have experience in growth marketing<br />* Have startup experience (whether an ex-founder or having worked in an early-stage startup)<br />* Already live in London or are willing to move to London (or close by) in the future<br /><br />_We are open to:_<br />* Full time (45+ hrs/week) or part-time commitment (we're open to your suggestions)<br />* You persuading us that you’re the right person, whatever your background & experience <br /><br />-------------<br /><br />*What We Offer*<br /><br />* The opportunity to become the cofounder of a fast growing _tech for good_ startup<br />* A generous equity package (experience based)<br />* Salary after the seed raise, and some pay to cover some living expenses until then<br />* Flexible working (you can work on a flexible schedule & you can work remotely and out of our coworking space in London)<br /><br />All applications/enquiries will be responded to in the strictest confidence.",

This would be a Python backend role, with our APIs and other web tools written using the Flask framework and querying a MariaDB database. We have a lot of raw rugby data comprised of scores and coordinates that we need to get in a query-able format, and then to build the tools and interpret and maintain that data.</p><p>An appreciation of data and sport is essential: we need hard working people who love data, love coding, and who want to learn. As part of the development team we’ll expect you to have a solid understanding and (preferably) demonstrable experience of development best practices. We like open source technologies; if you can show involvement in such projects all the better. If you’re a bit inexperienced, that’s fine – just show us what you can do.</p><p>This is a full-time role, but we are also open to exceptional applicants who wish to work alongside existing university/college studies (such as a data science degree), with a view to exploring a more permanent role once the studies have been completed.</p><h4>Restrictions</h4><ul><li>Telecommuting is OK</li><li>No Agencies Please</li></ul><h4>Requirements</h4><p>Python and MySQL/MariaDB is essential.</p><p>Any of Flask, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy desirable.</p><p>Basics of the Linux shell and Git of course.</p><p>Perl exposure an advantage.</p><h4>About the Company</h4><p>Ellipse is a sports analytics company, at present primarily comprised of CricViz for cricket, but now branching into other sports, beginning with rugby.</p><p>At CricViz we analyse highly detailed cricket data, then build products out of them. These include statistical models, predictive algorithms, new metrics, APIs and web tools we have built and sold to a growing customer base around the world. We work with TV broadcasters like Sky in the UK, Foxtel in Australia, ICC, most of the major UK sport media and a couple of teams, helping to prepare their coaching staff with our detailed analysis.</p><p>We’re a small team of ten, half of which are technical, and often work remotely via Slack, but we do have space at our office (at The Oval cricket ground in south London) where we meet at least once a week. Hours are very flexible; project timelines less so. An ability to work independently is essential.</p><p></p>                      <h3>Desired Skills</h3>            <ul>                              <li><span>Flask</span></li>                              <li><span>Git</span></li>                              <li><span>Linux</span></li>                              <li><span>MySQL</span></li>                              <li><span>NumPy</span></li>                              <li><span>Pandas</span></li>                              <li><span>SciPy</span></li>                          </ul>                                          <h3>Contact Info</h3>            <ul>                                          <li><strong>Company Website:</strong> <a href='http://cricviz.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://cricviz.com/</a></li>            </ul>                  </div><a href='https://www.python.org/jobs/3837/' rel='nofollow'>Apply</a>",
