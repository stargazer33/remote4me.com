Through a scientific method of determining which site improvements result in actual performance improvements, we replace the old way of designing sites through gut feel and management opinions with designing sites through data. Tactically speaking, clients come to us for both strategic direction and to supplement their internal teams.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Director of Growth Product Management</h4></div><div>As a Director of Growth Product Management at CROmetrics, you will be a player/coach overseeing a team of people who are hybrid product manager, strategic thinker, account manager and data analyst. Your primary role is to enable our product managers to be successful. With your passion for helping your team be successful combined with your agency or client-facing experience, you’ll be able to quickly gain the respect of your team in showing them how it’s done while also helping them to develop the skills they’ll need to grow in their own careers. Product Managers spend much of their time interfacing with clients, designers and engineers. On the client side, our Product Managers must be able to generate data-driven ideas that will improve revenue and other key metrics on client websites while being rooted in better understanding what the customer wants.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Our PMs lead all A/B testing and personalization experimentation for the client, which includes the following:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Partnering with the client for the ideation, prioritization, road-mapping, design, and approval process for all hypotheses generation and experimentation</li><li>Diving deep into the results to deliver the data story, learnings and recommendations from the experiment</li><li>Collaborating with a remote team of engineers, designers and other PMs to support experiment ideation and execution</li><li>Managing all aspects of the client relationship from daily experiment monitoring to kicking off the renewal process to evangelizing the value of CROmetrics</li></ul><div><br></div><div>The director must be able to do all of these things on their own, and be focused on enabling their team to level up their skills. Expect about 10% travel as you visit key accounts regularly.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>In addition, as a CROmetrics team member, you will:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Support the professional growth of the team through leading and/or participating in ongoing training, e.g. book club</li><li>Engage in non-client related activities that help grow our business, e.g. writing the PM job description or delivering hypotheses and mock-ups for a sales deck</li><li>Actively participate in our remote culture</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div>If you don’t have previous management experience, an individual contributor role at CROmetrics might be a possibility. The type of individual contributor who will succeed in this role is strongly correlated with prior management experience since the type of client problems you encounter require solutions that leverage both the client and internal teams typical of strong internal product managers who need to influence teams that don’t report to them.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>Who we’re looking for</h4></div><div>Our most successful candidates have the following skills/experience/traits:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Lifelong learner</li><li>10+ years of professional experience working in digital product management. Some experience working with customers either as part of an agency or significant time freelancing is required. Familiarization with Optimizely is a bonus.</li><li>5+ years experience managing others. This is primarily a people management position, and you will have a team of high performers, so enabling your team should be the primary reason you’re interested in this job.</li><li>Demonstrated extremely strong presentation and communication skills.</li><li>Passion for using data to improve user experiences</li><li>Built and delivered product roadmaps full of winning and losing ideas</li><li>Hands-on experience analyzing digital business data to inform decisions and plan strategically</li><li>Worked cross-functionally in a highly collaborative environment, preferably in a remote capacity</li><li>Genuinely like working with clients and their distributed stakeholder groups</li><li>Love product strategy, but obsessed with the details on execution</li></ul><div>If you’re interested in checking out the people you’ll be working with, click here to&nbsp;<a href='https://crometrics.com/meet-the-team/' rel='nofollow'>learn more about the team.</a><br></div><div></div><div><i>If you have questions as you go through this, make notes and if we haven’t answered them by the end, feel free to email&nbsp;<a href='mailto:chris@crometrics.com' rel='nofollow'>walter@crometrics.com</a>.</i></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Benefits</h4></div><ul><li>Matching 401k on the first 4% of income subject to a 3 month waiting period.</li><li>100% remote, continue to work from where you are based.

Very often their fare structures are arcane, making you choose between &quot;Tariff AB, BC or ABC.&quot;</p><p>Mozio seeks to plug into all these sources and build your ultimate city mobility solution: we want you to be able to book a Supershuttle in Dallas, the Heathrow Express train in London, the U-Bahn in Germany, and Lyft when you get back home to SF.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Earth</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>11-50

We're self-funded and doing this for 6.5 years. We believe in what we do, and are committed to the team and our value proposition.

No one works &quot;for&quot; RiteKit; we listen, mentor, involve people in the decision making. We work &quot;with&quot; people not above them. Please feel welcome to ask any of us to explain what the difference means to to them. See Hashtag Academy in Medium to see their interviews and read what they say about our impact on careers.</p><p>What do our interns do after us? Search RiteTag in LinkedIn, then do an advanced  search to see the people. Our interns either join the team or have moved on to PopSugar, Google, Snapchat and so on.</p><p>Our four SaaS products in 60 seconds: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to RiteKit</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to RiteKit</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>All RiteKit internships are unpaid. If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. Also, we work remotely (we all work from where we live). </p><p>&quot;Hashtags! Yay!&quot;</p><p>NO!!! </p><p>That's not actually what we're about. We build a suite of SaaS products for people and companies that expect social ROI: they need to get something back when they share to social.</p><p>RiteForge and RiteBoost do total social media optimization: images, custom visuals, link ads - and data-driven auto-hashtagging as well. For those who need to get business, sign-ups, or sales from what they share in Facebook, Twitter and beyond, RiteForge automates image creation and extraction, adds a call-to-action header to pages shared socially, and uses text analysis and machine learning to aid with hashtags as well.  </p><p>What is RiteKit?<br>The initial concept for RiteTag, our first product, was borne of the aftermath of the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. After witnessing the flurry of disorganized social media activity, our CEO and Founder wanted to help people get their social content discovered in an increasing noisy world.<br>What SEO does for web pages, SMO (social media optimization) does for video uploads, sound files, Facebook updates, Tweets... and it is much more than hashtags that does this. Today we continue to build tools to further our original mission to increase the customer's social media presence.</p><p>We build data-driven social media engagement SaaS products.

(Best case scenario: after this internship you either launch your own startup, join one as a co-founder, or become so important to us that you create a position for yourself on our team.)<br>• Forge alliances with people at companies and startups that should be using our APIs and/or SaaS products<br>• Engage our growing community in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium and beyond.<br>• Write case study articles for our blogs.<br>• Do what it takes to get original articles on getting things done with RiteKit in major news sites and top-tier blogs.<br>• Learn how to win at marketing</p><p>Terms &amp; Requirements:<br>• Ability to learn and teach RiteKit products and coach a business owner to use them so that they get social ROI. This will be your entry exam and how you will qualify for the internship.<br>• Ability to collaborate in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>• Commitment: 6 months at 3-5 hours/week OR 12 months at 2~3 hours/week (decide later, no rush)<br>• Be okay with the internship being UNPAID. <br>• Must be well-written and have proven ability to create visual content<br>• No relocation needed; we work remotely</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers. </p><p>As a self funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends that have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>PR, Sales, Social Media Marketing, Public Relations, Customer Relationship Management, Sales and Marketing, Community Development, Customer Success, English language</div><div>Compensation</div><div>No Salary<br>No Equity</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to RiteKit</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/shortfundly/jobs/92378-marketing?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/shortfundly/jobs/92378-marketing?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Marketing</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/shortfundly/jobs/92378-marketing?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Shortfundly</a></div><div>Chennai</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/lucid-vr/jobs/82748-growth-marketing-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/lucid-vr/jobs/82748-growth-marketing-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Growth Marketing Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/lucid-vr/jobs/82748-growth-marketing-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Lucid</a></div><div>Santa Clara</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/prose-media/jobs/42372-fall-18-internship-writing-marketing-entrepreneurship?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/prose-media/jobs/42372-fall-18-internship-writing-marketing-entrepreneurship?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Fall '18 Internship: Writing / M...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/prose-media/jobs/42372-fall-18-internship-writing-marketing-entrepreneurship?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Prose Media</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/reedsy/jobs/53227-social-media-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/reedsy/jobs/53227-social-media-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Social Media Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/reedsy/jobs/53227-social-media-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Reedsy</a></div><div>London, Western Europe, United States</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/btotree/jobs/172243-internship-marketing?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/btotree/jobs/172243-internship-marketing?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Internship Marketing</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/btotree/jobs/172243-internship-marketing?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>BtoTree</a></div><div>Tokyo</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/reedsy/jobs/60489-content-marketing-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/reedsy/jobs/60489-content-marketing-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Content Marketing Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/reedsy/jobs/60489-content-marketing-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Reedsy</a></div><div>Western Europe, United States, Canada</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/expii/jobs/58777-engineering-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/expii/jobs/58777-engineering-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Engineering Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/expii/jobs/58777-engineering-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Expii</a></div><div>Pittsburgh</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/ritekit/jobs/45525-web-dev-internship-must-have-experience-with-django-rest-framework-vue-js?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/ritekit/jobs/45525-web-dev-internship-must-have-experience-with-django-rest-framework-vue-js?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Web Dev Internship (Must have ex...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/ritekit/jobs/45525-web-dev-internship-must-have-experience-with-django-rest-framework-vue-js?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>RiteKit</a></div><div>Earth</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/listium/jobs/94436-intern-founder-s-apprentice-product-evangelist?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/listium/jobs/94436-intern-founder-s-apprentice-product-evangelist?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Intern / &quot;Founder's apprentice&quot;

We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.</p><p>ConsenSys is presently comprised of a number of core personnel — some of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development, acquisitions, investments, or the formation of joint ventures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Brooklyn</span>, Remote

Rather than working for a mega-corp, you will be working in a company where your work has real impact in the fun, high-growth stages of our evolution.</p><p>We are looking for security analysts to join our forensics team. You will assist our customers to investigate how their site was hacked and to repair their site and remove all traces of the intrusion. In addition to this you will also collect evidence from intrusions that will help improve our threat detection. You will need to determine how the intrusion occurred and then collect all IOC’s (indicators of compromise) and share this data with our product team in a structured way.</p><p>General requirements:</p><p>● You must be highly technical and be comfortable with a wide range of open source tools.</p><p>● Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</p><p>● You must work well in a team.</p><p>● You must be nimble, be able to come up with creative solutions to challenging problems and must have a mature approach to problem solving.</p><p>● Attention to detail.</p><p>Note: Applicants who can work weekends will be given priority consideration.</p><p>We have the highest star rating for any WordPress plugin in history and we pride ourselves on providing an excellent product with great customer service that helps secure small and large production websites. If you're passionate about information security and would like to help secure the web, this is your dream job. We take our team's family time seriously and don't ask you to work long hours if we can avoid it (we almost always can). Our entire team works remotely using Slack for casual interaction ­so you can live practically anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. Wordfence is high growth, but we are not a startup. The company is still controlled by the founders, we are profitable and have been for many years. So you will enjoy the rush of high growth but you won't have to risk working for a company that is controlled by venture capitalists or may not be here tomorrow.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://defiant.workable.com/j/806EFFE4AE' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Defiant Inc</h3>            <div><p>At Defiant, ‘trust’ is the attribute we value most highly among our team members.

    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Marketing* *Manager*.<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />As Marketing Manager you will play an important role by supporting all of Switchee’s marketing efforts, owning a number channels and producing content strategies and collateral. On joining you will be exposed to all commercial and operational aspects of the business. Depending on requirements and the specific development plan we agree with you, you will gain experience in ops and customer account management / support teams so that you have a full understanding of Switchee before taking up your role in marketing.<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />* Work closely with our CEO, CCO, Head of Sales as well as Head of Marketing<br />* Contribute to the development of Switchee’s marketing strategy<br />* Generate insightful, thought provoking written content<br />* Brief partners to deliver engaging visual & press content<br />* Manage online and social media marketing & advertising campaigns<br />* Manage social media (Twitter & LinkedIn)<br />* Organise attendance at conferences – negotiating exhibitor plots and speaking slots<br />* Work with the sales team to produce relevant sales and marketing collateral<br />* Work with operations and resident support to design and produce resident communications<br />* Prepare quarterly and annual reports<br /><br /><br />We are a company built on a strong technical foundation. You’ll need to grasp and communicate a technical solution with clients. We also expect you to work closely with Product Development to ensure our product evolves with the customer’s needs at the very centre.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Your* *experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:<br /><br />* At least 2 years’ experience in marketing<br />* Bachelor’s degree from a top university<br />* Excellent communication and interpersonal skills<br />* Proven ability to develop and implement effective marketing strategies<br />* Strong analytical & numeracy skills with command of Excel<br />* B2B experience preferred<br /><br />Nice to have:<br /><br />* Experience in a small & quickly expanding business preferred<br />* Knowledge of the housing sector preferred<br />* Experience working with Internet of Things devices<br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home.
