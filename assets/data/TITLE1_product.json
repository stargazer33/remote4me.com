In short, you’ll be charged with ensuring teachers and students are logging into the product regularly, performing key activities once there, and coming back often. You’ll work closely with our product management team to understand the user activities that drive sustained, deep engagement, and will subsequently design and execute marketing programs that encourage our users to get the most out of our product. Working closely with Product, Customer Success, and Marketing, you will define our user engagement marketing strategy, design user engagement marketing programs, and execute campaigns across email, social media, in-product marketing and more to drive user registrations, monthly active users, and convert casual users into power users. As part of the Marketing team, you’ll also get hands-on experience building out sophisticated campaign performance tracking to ensure our leadership is equipped with accurate, actionable data to make the best decisions to drive business growth.</p><p><strong>Why You’ll Love This Role:</strong></p><p>Engagement is the lifeblood of any SaaS company, and Newsela is no different. If users aren’t engaging with our product deeply and often, our brand halo will suffer, and paying schools and districts are more likely to churn. What’s worse, we won’t be accomplishing our mission of improving K-12 education. This is your opportunity to be a part of a world-class marketing team, leading an area that’s core to the company’s growth. Your work will be central to transforming Newsela’s perception from a niche supplemental content provider to a true partner that can solve some of the biggest instructional content challenges education leaders face. And you’ll go home every evening with the satisfaction of having helped thousands of teachers deliver a better learning experience for their students.</p><p><strong>Why We’ll Love You:</strong></p><p>You are a data-driven B2B marketer with great strategic instincts, are deeply collaborative, and possess exceptional project management skills. You have a passion for getting users to engage with products and have led marketing campaigns that have created sizable, sustained increases in user engagement metrics for at least 5 years. You have experience with A/B testing, multivariate testing, and are excited by optimizing messaging, offers, channels, and creative to improve user engagement metrics. You have a working knowledge of marketing automation platforms, social media management tools, and leading marketing analytics tools (such as Google Analytics, Adobe, Optimizely, etc.).</p><p><strong>About Newsela:</strong></p><p>One of the fastest growing tech companies in K-12 education, Newsela was founded on the principle that while every child learns differently, they all deserve a rich learning experience that ignites a love of learning. We built our platform based on learning science research to deliver the most engaging, authentic content to modernize how teaching happens in the classroom. Along with interactive assessments and tools, we provide teachers with digital content at five reading levels — from +100 of the best sources — that is relevant to the diverse backgrounds and interests of their students. Since we started in 2013, we’ve become an essential solution for 90% of U.S. K-12 schools and serve +25 million users.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://newsela.com/company/jobs/?gh_jid=2162591' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

    "content": "<h3> Humbly Confident Product Manager </h3><div><h3><strong>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</strong></h3><div>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8' rel='nofollow'>reviews on the app store</a>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.<br><br></div><div>We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal budgeting apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. Our mission is to help our users take total control of their money—not just by using an app (if only it were that easy!), but changing habits and ways of thinking.<br><br></div><div>YNAB is growing, and so is our product team. You’re the product manager we’re looking for if you’re collaborative, results-oriented, creative, persistent, and disciplined. (So far, so good?) You love solving complex problems—both internally and for our users—and know what it means to build a mature, evolving product. You’re customer-centric and have a knack for developing a deep understanding of their needs, <em>and </em>you could say the same about understanding the needs a SaaS business like YNAB faces in the larger market landscape. You probably organize things in your sleep and enjoy making sense of chaos — but you’re also comfortable living in spots where messy is THE place to be. You communicate for a living and you know it, so you understand the language of development and design, marketing and support, and use those languages well in all mediums, from face-to-face, to long-form, to comments in a Figma file. You expound on decision-making strategies for <em>way </em>too long at summer barbeques, but somehow keep people listening.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):&nbsp;</strong></div><ul><li>You must have at least five years working in the software industry, at least three as a product manager or other key role on a product team. Complex, data-rich applications are a plus.</li><li>You must have experience in cross-functional product development. And we really mean that cross-functional part.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>That’s a super-brief intro to what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. Let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> Core Value Manifesto</a> has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</div><h3><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></h3><div>We’re talking product manager here, so you’d be working with a lot of different people. We can’t even list them all, really.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You’ll be reporting to <strong>Todd</strong>, our Chief Product Officer. He obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—especially any magic to make YNAB simpler to adopt and more powerful in the long run. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, enjoys ideas for their own sake—but also likes to get things done. You know? He likes long gaps of silence and very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.<br><br></div><div>You’ll join our two existing product managers, Megan and Elena.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Megan </strong><em>really</em> likes wearing multiple hats, but her heart lies in empathizing with users to inform strategy, inspire, and focus her team around what matters. She enjoys observing the curiosities of life and wonders why things are a certain way and if there might be another way. Megan loves the process of solving problems, and it’s a big part of what draws her to climbing and adventure racing, too, or any day out in the mountains! She thrives on challenges, type II fun, and breakfast burritos.<br><br></div><div><strong>Elena</strong> started at YNAB as a support specialist, with a focus on our bug reporting process. Empathy for the user experience remains a big focal point for her. As an ever-optimizer, when there’s a process, Elena will try to make it more efficient and straightforward. Pre-YNAB she worked in the cheese industry—if you’re a fan of fromage, you can look forward to many tasty recommendations!<br><br></div><div>And as we said above, you’ll also cross paths with--well--probably everyone else. People like Buffy and Sebastian (a couple of our developers), Niki or Alan (both designers), Angela (our Director of Customer Support), or Reema (our Marketing project manager).</div><h3>How You’ll Work at YNAB</h3><div>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named <a href='https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/2019/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune’s #4 Best Small Company to Work For</a>) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:<br><br></div><div><strong>Live Where You Want<br></strong><br></div><div>We’re a fully remote team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.<br><br></div><div><strong>No Crazy Hours<br></strong><br></div><div>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.<br><br></div><div><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong><br><br></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our #office_wall Slack channel.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>The YNAB Meetup<br></strong><br></div><div>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'> Costa Rica</a>, a <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and most recently, <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE' rel='nofollow'>Laguna Beach</a>. We work together, play together, and reinforce the bonds we’ve made as a team and company. Every year, we leave refreshed, motivated, and excited for the year ahead together.<br><br></div><div><strong>Up Your Game<br></strong><br></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, online courses and subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>International is Absolutely Okay</strong><br><br></div><div>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)<br><br></div><div><strong>Benefits<br></strong><br></div><div>For our US employees, we offer fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, we’ve got you covered!)<br><br></div><div>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.<br><br></div><div><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></div><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp;</li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and the holidays.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor. We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not <em>think</em> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB users gain control of their money. <em>You will change lives.&nbsp;</em></div><h3>Now, back to you, our new Product Manager...</h3><div><strong>What Success Looks Like: <br></strong><br></div><div>Our goal is for every user to achieve life-changing financial control. No small thing, right? In 2020, we’re focused on making YNAB effortless for new budgeters from their very first experience, and also helping <em>all</em> users see YNAB fit their needs—functional, social, and emotional—as they resolve financial struggles.<br><br></div><div>Looking inward, you’ll also help us evolve our systems and processes to deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users. We’ve been growing. A lot. That means we’re making changes (on the fly, hang on tight!) to our product structure to keep what we’ve learned works while adding new leverage. You’ll work closely with Todd, along with Megan and Elena, to facilitate our shift to more durable, empowered, problem &amp; progress focused product teams.<br><br></div><div><strong>You’ll need to:&nbsp;</strong></div><ul><li>Regularly ship real value to our users. You can both live two years ahead of your team and support them in the present moment as you shepherd your team’s work from discovery to ideation to release to follow-up. In particular, you’ll work hand-in-hand with a product designer on your team to jointly develop vision, prioritize, and execute on strategy.</li><li>Understand the user journey, not just the one in our apps, but the one in the real world as users resolve their financial struggles.</li><li>Be comfortable with multiple discovery and ideation strategies in your quest to make YNAB consistently better. You enjoy talking to customers in user interviews and usability testing and have a knack for summarizing research in a concise way for teammates.&nbsp;</li><li>Be a curious, persistent, and quick learner, staying ahead of new ideas, technologies and other opportunities to help YNAB users take total control of their money, and maybe even sleep better at night.</li><li>Understand deeply that at YNAB “cross-functional” isn’t code at YNAB for “designers and engineers.” We’ve doubled down on our best ideas coming from <em>anywhere</em>, so Support Specialists and Marketers are also members of our flat product teams.&nbsp;</li><li>Learn the design principles and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. Then learn our engineering processes like the back of your <em>other</em> hand. Then find <em>another</em> hand for internalizing our brand, marketing strategies and support ethic.</li><li>Synthesize and make sense of ALL THE DATA and information about our products, for yourself and to help others across the organization make better decisions. You’re fluent in quantitative and qualitative data collection and analysis—and are cautious about the failings of each.</li><li>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done in writing. Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</li><li>Be intensely curious. Period.</li><li>Oh, also, not to the exclusion of anything else, but you’re intensely curious about how people learn, what motivates them, how they change and develop habits, and how behavior inside a product might change behavior outside it.</li><li>Be comfortable speaking the language of software development and product design. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!), that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement. Conversant across all disciplines is key.</li><li>Manage key partner relationships, from day-to-day communication to contract negotiation and management.</li><li>“Bonus points” awarded if you already use and love YNAB.</li></ul><div>That’s twelve-and-a-half bullets, but let’s still say that your success as a product manager comes down to this: Your ability to approach product development as holistic, simultaneous, problem-solving of both user and business goals.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>And if we haven’t yet spilled enough metaphorical ink on this idea: We work collaboratively here so you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience—not because that’s nice, but because you see this as critical to our shared success. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain decisions and, not for nothing, make them when the rubber hits the road.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</div><h3><strong>How to Apply</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Apply </strong><a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0qxg4?apply=true' rel='nofollow'><strong>here</strong></a><strong> by 11:59PM on May 24th, 2020.</strong> Firm. It’s a real deadline. The kind you love.</li><li>Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:&nbsp;<ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit. Please limit this section of the cover letter to 1.5 pages.&nbsp;</li><li>On a separate page of your cover letter, answer the following questions (with each response being about a paragraph in length):&nbsp;<ul><li>1. What attracted you to this position? (This is not about what attracted you to the software.)</li><li>2. What criteria do you look for when searching for your next company or position?</li><li>3. What are your favorite and least favorite parts of your current job?</li><li>4. Tell us about a time when you had to learn something new to excel at your job.</li><li>5. We love someone with a perspective about product development. Answer, in one paragraph: <em>How early is too early to ship? How late is too late?</em></li></ul></li><li>Include the word “measure” somewhere in your cover letter.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for.</li><li>Please send all attachments as PDFs.&nbsp;</li><li>Please do <em>not</em> apply using the &quot;Apply with Indeed&quot; button below. Use the normal Apply button.</li></ul><div>P.S.&nbsp; If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!<br><br><br><br></div></div>",

    "content": "<p>NOTE: THIS IS A VOLUNTEER ONLY POSITION AT PRESENT</p><br /><p>Smart Migrator is an exciting and very disruptive tech startup (SaaS) based in London. We are revolutionising cloud migrations globally by building the world's first fully automated cloud migration platform. Everyone recognises that cloud computing is the future of IT. It can reduce costs, offer business agility and scalability and can be a platform for utilising countless opportunities, embracing the best of IT innovation.</p><br /><p>The journey to the cloud, however, is very complex and expensive. Most SMEs and even some large enterprises cannot afford the high cost to migrate. We are set to disrupt the global $120B market (expected to reach $448B by 2025) by offering the first of its kind solution that empowers companies of all size to make the critical transformational step. Our fully automated platform allows companies to migrate to the cloud 3-10x cheaper and 6-10x faster than traditional managed migrations services (from the likes of Accenture, IBM, DXC Technology and more).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We have built a very substantial MVP that automatically migrates Linux servers to AWS and we are currently fundraising so we can expand it to a full platform that has substantial capabilities and includes the other big clouds. In the current lockdown, fundraising has been put on hold but we are still actively looking to find companies that we can help migrate.</p><br /><p>In this sense, we are looking for marketing professionals who are currently furloughed and are curious to help spread the message for a unique innovative technology. This is mainly working on digital campaigns for social media. Ideally, we are looking for candidates with experience in B2B software or other tech (but not essential). What is essential is to have a creative vision and an outgoing personality.</p><br /><p>For now, we are only looking for furloughed volunteers. However, once we get funded, there would be permanent job opportunities for the right talent. We are a small, friendly and very passionate team spread across London, Sofia (Bulgaria) and Buenos Aires (Argentina).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>If what we are doing excites you and you are looking to add your mark and keep busy during the lockdown, we would love to hear from you. Keep safe :-)</p>",

We are a lean, flexible, 100% distributed team, backed by amazing investors like Accel, Salesforce, and Atlassian.&nbsp;\\n\\nAll 40-plus of us work wherever we’d like—reliable internet access is our only requirement. Spread across 9 time zones in 10 countries, we sign into Slack and open up our work tools on the schedule that fits our lives best. We communicate asynchronously, work autonomously, and take ownership of our work. Distributed work isn’t for everyone, but if it fits your management style, it’s a life-changing benefit.\\n\\nBeing 100% distributed doesn’t stop us from getting to know each other— we have daily conversations in chat, weekly “coffee” pairings with coworkers, and once a year we all come together for an all-team retreat.\\n\\nWhat Makes Us Different\\n\\n\\n* Fully remote team - no offices\\n\\n* Unlimited PTO policy\\n\\n* Annual company offsite\\n\\n* Generous health insurance for US Employees and their families\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur values&nbsp;\\n\\nAs a small, nimble company, we want our employees to feel empowered to make decisions and define the future of our company, so our values include:\\n\\n\\n* Act like an owner (Agency!)\\n\\n* Default to action (Processes are great; bureaucracy isn't!)\\n\\n* Focus on the process (See? Great.)\\n\\n* Practice prioritization (There are an infinite number of useful things to do. We trust you to pick the best ones.)\\n\\n* Pay attention to details (Our customers count on us!)\\n\\n* Over-communicate everything. Twice (See what we did there?)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Opportunity&nbsp;\\n\\nWe are looking for a Senior Product Manager to help us make recurring work fun, fast, and faultless for teams everywhere.\\n\\nWhat You’ll Do&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* You’ll be responsible for defining a product strategy and KPIs, gaining alignment from company leaders and stakeholders, and prioritizing a roadmap that helps your team achieve your business goals.\\n\\n* You will articulate user problems and product needs, iterating with a core team of design and engineering experts as well as stakeholders in research, data, support, sales, and marketing and other company stakeholders.\\n\\n* You’ll help define hypotheses for product enhancements and run experiments to validate contributions towards user and business outcomes.\\n\\n* You will coordinate across teams to maintain product and strategy alignment, eliminating surprises, and finding creative ways to make the “whole greater than the sum of its parts.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout You\\n\\n\\n* 5+ years as a Product Manager at a product-led SaaS software company\\n\\n* Familiarity with design and development team workflows\\n\\n* A data-driven approach to product development and growth\\n\\n* Comfortable engaging with end-users, conducting user research, and intelligently integrating findings into your work\\n\\n* The ability to dive into big projects and manage them from start to finish\\n\\n* The ability to thrive in a variable and demanding startup environment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDiverse Teams Build Better Products\\n\\nLegally, we need you to know this:&nbsp;\\n\\nProcess Street does not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class. We support workplace diversity.\\n\\nBut we want to add this:\\n\\nWe strongly believe that diversity contributes to a broader collective perspective that will consistently lead to a better company and better products. We are working hard to increase the diversity of our team wherever we can and we actively encourage everyone to consider becoming a part of it.  </div> </div>",

We are a lean, flexible, 100% distributed team, backed by amazing investors like Accel, Salesforce, and Atlassian.&nbsp;</p><p>All 40-plus of us work wherever we’d like—reliable internet access is our only requirement. Spread across 9 time zones in 10 countries, we sign into Slack and open up our work tools on the schedule that fits our lives best. We communicate asynchronously, work autonomously, and take ownership of our work. Distributed work isn’t for everyone, but if it fits your management style, it’s a life-changing benefit.</p><p>Being 100% distributed doesn’t stop us from getting to know each other— we have daily conversations in chat, weekly “coffee” pairings with coworkers, and once a year we all come together for an all-team retreat.</p><p><strong>What Makes Us Different</strong></p><ul><li>Fully remote team - no offices</li><li>Unlimited PTO policy</li><li>Annual company offsite</li><li>Generous health insurance for US Employees and their families</li></ul><p><strong>Our values</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>As a small, nimble company, we want our employees to feel empowered to make decisions and define the future of our company, so our values include:</p><ul><li>Act like an owner (Agency!)</li><li>Default to action (Processes are great; bureaucracy isn't!)</li><li>Focus on the process (See? Great.)</li><li>Practice prioritization (There are an infinite number of useful things to do. We trust you to pick the best ones.)</li><li>Pay attention to details (Our customers count on us!)</li><li>Over-communicate everything. Twice (See what we did there?)</li></ul><p><strong>The Opportunity&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We are looking for a Senior Product Manager to help us make recurring work fun, fast, and faultless for teams everywhere.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Do&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll be responsible for defining a product strategy and KPIs, gaining alignment from company leaders and stakeholders, and prioritizing a roadmap that helps your team achieve your business goals.</li><li>You will articulate user problems and product needs, iterating with a core team of design and engineering experts as well as stakeholders in research, data, support, sales, and marketing and other company stakeholders.</li><li>You’ll help define hypotheses for product enhancements and run experiments to validate contributions towards user and business outcomes.</li><li>You will coordinate across teams to maintain product and strategy alignment, eliminating surprises, and finding creative ways to make the “whole greater than the sum of its parts.”</li></ul><p><strong>About You</strong></p><ul><li>5+ years as a Product Manager at a product-led SaaS software company</li><li>Familiarity with design and development team workflows</li><li>A data-driven approach to product development and growth</li><li>Comfortable engaging with end-users, conducting user research, and intelligently integrating findings into your work</li><li>The ability to dive into big projects and manage them from start to finish</li><li>The ability to thrive in a variable and demanding startup environment</li></ul><p><strong>Diverse Teams Build Better Products</strong></p><p><em>Legally, we need you to know this:&nbsp;</em></p><p>Process Street does not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class.

We are helping families raise children with autism. Keep this in mind with every decision.</li><li>You are responsible for your work. Tell what you are going to do versus asking for permission.&nbsp;</li><li>Mistakes are OK. Not extracting lessons and implementing those into future processes is not OK.</li><li>Lead with questions, not answers.</li><li>Expect dialogues &amp; debates. We are passionate people trying to do something great.</li><li>100% of all energy and resources go to our core focus.</li><li>We are a systems-based company. Freedom of thought comes from a foundation of discipline.</li><li>Freedom and responsibility within the framework of a highly developed system.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Make sure to look through our <a href='https://harkla.co/collections/frontpage' rel='nofollow'>product catalog</a> so you are familiar with our company.<br><br></div><div><br></div><h3><strong>WHAT WILL YOUR ROLE BE?</strong></h3><div><br></div><div>You will come in and learn under our Marketing Manager, Josh the ins and outs of selling products on Amazon.

Gatsby makes creating for the web dramatically better by making creating novel experiences easier — shortening the time to try experiments, collaborate around changes, and to deploy incremental improvements. Gatsby has quickly grown to be one of the biggest and most exciting open source projects on the web, with almost 100,000 developers using Gatsby every month.</p><p>As a remote-first, community-focused team, Gatsby’s core values include transparency (we work in public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.</p><p><strong>Details of this role:</strong></p><ul><li>Type of work: Full time</li><li>Location: Remote&nbsp;<em>(preference for UTC-8 to UTC+0)</em></li></ul><p><strong>Why we’re hiring</strong></p><p>Content collaboration has changed a lot since the birth of the CMS. Your role will be to help it change even more.</p><p>In the early 2000s, CMSs pioneered collaboration. But in 2020, the state of the art is being defined by SaaS apps: shareable URLs for particular artifacts, on-page commenting, annotation, fine-grained and role-based permissioning models, in-product kanban boards, beautifully designed workflows, and so on.</p><p>In late 2000s, CMSs contained all the functionality necessary for building a site: templating, forms, analytics, search, and so on. But in 2020, the future is the content mesh. When website teams want to add content, they can use Contentful; for search, Algolia; for payments, Stripe; for analytics, Segment; for A/B testing, Optimizely.</p><p>Your job will be to figure out what content collaboration looks like in modular, best-of-breed content mesh world; and then, step-by-step, recreate CMS functionality in an&nbsp;<em>even better way</em>. Just as Sketch’s lack of built-in collaboration (as an installed rather than cloud-based app) led to the rise of Invision, Figma, etc with rich commenting, markup, and other collaboration features, Gatsby’s collaboration tooling will eclipse current CMS tooling.</p><p>Yet doing this skillfully will be a mix of greenfield and the adjacent possible; building block-by-block in a way that appeals to incremental users: content creators and editors on teams that are already using, or considering, Gatsby.</p><p><strong>What you’ll do on a day-to-day basis:</strong></p><ul><li>Determine what gets built and delivered to customers.&nbsp;You’ll acquire, as quickly as possible, deep knowledge of the customer, of the data, of internal stakeholders, and of the market and industry. Your job is to see the forest and the trees clearly enough to identify the product paths through it.</li><li>Work closely with design.&nbsp;The patterns for how content collaboration should work in the content mesh are less clear than current paradigms where you have full control over content sources. You’ll need to work closely with design to think through these problems and provide maximum utility and minimal friction to end-users.</li><li>Work directly with engineers to build exceptional products. You will lead the product development process from roadmap development to building, testing, and launching products on time.</li><li>Balance the business needs and technical constraints&nbsp;by navigating bottlenecks, providing escalation management, and anticipating trade-offs.</li><li>Work with product marketing to position Gatsby collaboration features. Positioning will be crucial in moving Gatsby Cloud spent from smaller developer budgets to larger marketing budgets.</li><li>Balance multiple personas. You’ll be responsible for building for a number of different personas that are using Gatsby (content creator &amp; editors, other marketers, execs, agencies) &amp; will need to balance their needs and priorities.</li><li>Advocate for the customer&nbsp;by being a champion for the user experience and having deep customer empathy.</li></ul><p><strong>Experience &amp; Qualities</strong></p><p>You’ll need to hit the ground running, which means experience getting your head around these aspects as quickly as possible.</p><ul><li>Launched products successfully as a PM in a startup environment.&nbsp;We’re iterating rapidly on a number of fronts, and tend to optimize for quickly getting product in the hands of users (and receiving feedback) over Platonic feature-completeness. Familiarity with SaaS collaboration and/or the CMS. A large part of what you’re doing is applying SaaS collaboration patterns to content management, so you’ll want deep familiarity in at least one area.</li><li>Familiarity with the developer persona. While you won’t be directly PM-ing the developer persona, a huge part of the Gatsby experience is the Gatsby CLI and suite of related tools (GraphQL, hot reloading environment, etc). A comfort with technical details is paramount — bonus points for specific knowledge about front-end development and/or CMSs.</li><li>Great judgment.&nbsp;You will need to consistently manage tradeoffs and evaluate new ideas. These decisions often have a vast impact. As Amazon puts it, “leaders are right. A lot.”</li><li>Write, speak, and think clearly.&nbsp;Gatsby is a distributed company and relies heavily on crisp and thorough writing. Your ability to get the right feedback and align the company will rely heavily on thoughtful synthesis of internal and external conversations and strategic planning into product documents, and clear communication to all stakeholders.</li><li>Leverage metrics to focus on value.&nbsp;You have experience using data and metrics to back up assumptions and assertions of business value. You also leverage your strong analytical skills and ability to dive deep to develop a nuanced understanding of your product and customers, and to create effective strategies.</li><li>Comfortable owning entire products.&nbsp;You will be managing Gatsby’s commercial product. As a product-driven company, a large proportion of whether we hit our annual revenue targets will be whether we’re able to ship enough value to our company.</li><li>High level of curiosity. The web is an incredibly diverse place with a huge number of different communities. You’re fascinated to learn about the challenges, workflows, and hopes and dreams of a wide variety of people.</li><li>Trustworthiness. A great product manager is trusted deeply by the engineering team. Tech leads and engineering ICs feel comfortable DM-ing their product manager at any time when they run across product questions in their day-to-day work, because they can count on getting accurate, thoughtful, helpful context.</li></ul><p><strong>The best parts of this job</strong></p><ul><li>Your role will be key in making Gatsby the next way to build on the web—and a technology that enables the next billion internet users. ‘Nuff said.</li><li>You will lead the production of one of the most highly-anticipated products in the web development space.&nbsp;Freelance developers and enterprise companies alike are eagerly awaiting the launch of Gatsby Cloud—and you will lead it.</li><li>You’ll have an opportunity to play a huge leadership role in a high-profile, growing company.&nbsp;Next to the CEO, this is perhaps the most cross-functional role in the entire Gatsby organization. You’ll have the chance to influence the work of almost everyone in the company.</li><li>You get to interact with an active, open, friendly community&nbsp;of developers that are really excited about building high-performance, fun-to-use websites. Their energy is often infectious, and you will leave conversations with them even more excited about Gatsby.</li></ul><p><strong>The worst parts of this job</strong></p><ul><li>This role involves building for a fairly greenfield persona.&nbsp;We’re building a whole new suite of functionality, in an&nbsp;<em>absolutely huge</em>&nbsp;potential market, for a content editor/creator persona. If you’re the type of PM that prefers building feature #9 or #19 for a persona, to feature #2 or #3, this role probably isn’t for you.</li><li>You will need to ruthlessly prioritize your workflow.&nbsp;Because our user audience is so diverse, there’s a huge amount of potential things to do at any time. You’ll need to be comfortable with thoughtfully choosing where to focus and communicating that.</li><li>Stakeholders are dispersed far and wide.&nbsp;The largest clustering of people in one place is 5 folks in our Berkeley office. We have a strong sense of identity and are very close, but if in-person interactions with a large number of people is important to you then this may not be a good fit.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Unlimited vacation policy, with a&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>&nbsp;of 15 days paid vacation time</li><li>Skip the commute with remote work</li><li>Stock options in a fast-growing startup</li><li>Amazing health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family (US only)</li><li>3 months of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement</li><li>Fly to cool locations 3x/year for company-wide meetups</li><li>Gatsby Sabbatical: 4 weeks paid vacation after 4 years tenure</li></ul><p><strong>Equal Opportunity</strong></p><p>Gatsby is an equal opportunity employer. We eagerly seek applicants of diverse backgrounds and hire without regard to race, color, gender identity, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, physical abilities (or disability), age, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law. Cultivating inclusivity and diversity is a top priority.</p><p>Headhunters and recruitment agencies may not submit resumes/CVs through this website or directly to managers. Gatsby does not accept unsolicited headhunter and agency resumes, and will not pay fees to any third-party agency or company that does not have a signed agreement with Gatsby.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.com/careers/senior-product-manager--marketing---content-collaboration--4027422003' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We are a market leader in many product categories such as sleeping bags, cots, ski gloves, ski goggles, running gloves, stand up paddles, surfing accessories, headwear and more.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></div><div>We’re looking for a highly quantitative, analytical, creative, curious and proactive person to join as our E-Commerce &amp; Conversion Rate Manager. In particular, we’re looking for someone to optimize the conversion rates of our 100+ products on Amazon in a scalable way.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>This role is highly multi-disciplinary, requiring you to wear several hats:</strong></div><ul><li>Product Manager: you’ll have to understand all our products and the various demographics that buy them</li><li>Business Analyst: you’ll have to go through our sales, conversion rate and traffic reports every week to identify struggling products, areas for improvement and sales trends</li><li>Creative Director &amp; Copy Editor: you’ll go through our products on Amazon, looking for opportunities to improve conversion rates through better model/lifestyle photos, videos and copywriting</li><li>Project Manager: you may set the vision and help manage large photo/video shoots of our products as we seek to improve the quality and conversion rates of all our listings<br><br></li></ul><div><strong>Here are a few specific things you will work on:</strong></div><ul><li>Track our products’ conversion rates and traffic by week and month, take action when necessary.

Is this a traffic or conversion rate issue?</li><li>Prioritize products based on their sales and conversion rate potential improvement.&nbsp;</li><li>Approve/edit/test copy: take the existing copy and edit/approve it.

Example: we found that an older demographic buys our white arm sleeves (for sun protection) while a younger demo buys our black sleeves (for sports like basketball and football). How do we appeal to each demographic?&nbsp;</li><li>Communicate issues with the Sales &amp; Marketing &amp; Creative teams to solve issues. Example: based on the competition, here are a few ideas on how we can improve conversion rates on this product</li><li>Ask the creative team to callout features about our product in the listing images. Example: many customer reviews rave about the sweatband liner on this hat. Can we add a photo of this sweatband?&nbsp;</li><li>Identify ways to improve our listings. Example: customers keep asking about whether this product works with soft-top surfboards. Can we include this in the listing?&nbsp;</li><li>Understand how the Amazon ranking algorithm works — the algorithm is an ever-changing black box. We must understand it as much as possible in order to maximize conversion rates</li><li>Track our product’s keyword rankings on Amazon to understand which searches are driving the most revenue for us on Amazon.

We are revolutionising cloud migrations globally by building the world's first fully automated cloud migration platform. Everyone recognises that cloud computing is the future of IT. It can reduce costs, offer business agility and scalability and can be a platform for utilising countless opportunities, embracing the best of IT innovation.</p><br /><p>The journey to the cloud, however, is very complex and expensive. Most SMEs and even some large enterprises cannot afford the high cost to migrate. We are set to disrupt the global $120B market (expected to reach $448B by 2025) by offering the first of its kind solution that empowers companies of all size to make the critical transformational step. Our fully automated platform allows companies to migrate to the cloud 3-10x cheaper and 6-10x faster than traditional managed migrations services (from the likes of Accenture, IBM, DXC Technology and more).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We have built a very substantial MVP that automatically migrates Linux servers to AWS and we are currently fundraising so we can expand it to a full platform that has substantial capabilities and includes the other big clouds. In the current lockdown, fundraising has been put on hold but we are still actively looking to find companies that we can help migrate.</p><br /><p>In this sense, we are looking for marketing professionals who are currently furloughed and are curious to help spread the message for a unique innovative technology. This is mainly working on digital campaigns for social media. Ideally, we are looking for candidates with experience in B2B software or other tech (but not essential). What is essential is to have a creative vision and an outgoing personality.</p><br /><p>For now, we are only looking for furloughed volunteers. However, once we get funded, there would be permanent job opportunities for the right talent. We are a small, friendly and very passionate team spread across London, Sofia (Bulgaria) and Buenos Aires (Argentina).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>If what we are doing excites you and you are looking to add your mark and keep busy during the lockdown, we would love to hear from you. Keep safe :-)</p>",

We’ve had some great developers, but never a true leader of all things tech because it hasn’t been necessary. However, now it is. And I’m looking for a true needle-in-a-haystack to sprint along side me as we execute on our next growth leg.</p><p>Our mission at Metabolic Living is to make our metabolism-first lifestyle the worldwide standard for healthy living. Even without the current pandemic, people struggle with their health, confused by so many competing options that don’t get results. So, we’ve developed a simple process anybody can follow to optimize their metabolism to deliver the energy their body needs to thrive.</p><p>We run on a LAMP stack on AWS, have a team of 3 developers (100+ people in company) and now need a senior tech leader to help us achieve our next growth target of $100MM and beyond. You have the opportunity to build out the perfect team the way YOU see fit. We do not yet have a mobile technical strategy in place, so this is an opportunity for you to define that as well.</p><p>The ideal candidate is both a high-caliber, full-stack developer and systems architect who loves to code, as well as a fantastic manager who is very marketing- and consumer-oriented and business-savvy. We only want someone who has been there and done that as we have lots of wood to chop on the business end. We need to rely on a steady proven rock as leader of all things tech to get things done.</p><p>And it’s a HUGE plus if you’re passionate about health and wellness </p><p>Yes, we know we’re asking for someone unique, but we’re putting this out there anyway to find the right candidate, with a robust compensation package to reflect this unique challenge. If you’re interested, you’ll find the full story of our company below – we’re only interested in talking to people who are inspired by this and want to be a part of this amazing journey we’re on.</p><p>In spite of the crisis the world is in, we’re thriving, and in fact growing, because of the products and services we sell.&nbsp;Our goal is to build a $1 billion dollar consumer brand by 2023 and technology will play an enormously important role in achieving that.&nbsp;We’re just putting the finishing touches on our re-branding efforts (more on that below) and will be launching our flagship e-commerce website in 2-3 months. That will be followed by a robust app that simplifies everything for consumers this Fall.</p><p>We’re particularly excited about the app as it will be the future of the company&nbsp;as we integrate our propriety Metabolic OS and automate customized meal plans, workouts and lifestyle changes that truly reflect the uniqueness of each individual. And how that uniqueness changes over time in response to changes in your physiology, psychology, preferences and other lifestyle factors.</p><p>If you’re a proven tech leader who knows how to both build and manage a team in a fast-moving environment and is a truly high-caliber end-to-end full stack web and mobile developer and…</p><ul><li>You LOVE to build things to perfection, but know how to iterate rapidly to gain traction…</li><li>You LOVE working on consumer-facing websites, applications and architecture</li><li>You LOVE everything e-commerce-related and have deep experience in payments…</li><li>You LOVE building apps with the&nbsp;<em>right</em>&nbsp;tech so things “just work” flawlessly…</li><li>You LOVE to think, solve complex problems and get a rush when your builds go live…</li></ul><p>Then please read on as you’re the ideal candidate… and we’d love to talk to you ASAP.</p><p><strong>To summarize the key points:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Salary</em>: $150,000 – $250,000</li><li><em>Location</em>:&nbsp;100% Remote (virtual team of 100+ with no corporate office)</li><li><em>Benefits</em>: Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k</li><li><em>Hours</em>: 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. (preferably Eastern time but flexible for right candidate)</li><li><em>Culture</em>: High-Performance but Humble (<em>no</em>&nbsp;jerks) that Creates Space for Deep Work</li><li><em>Personality</em>: Obsessed with Details so We can Simplify the Complex for Others</li></ul><p><strong>Who is This Opportunity Perfect for?</strong></p><p>This is the perfect opportunity for a tech leader who loves to roll up their sleeves and code, enjoys building teams and who has an unstoppable drive for excellence and might relate to any of these:</p><p>If you’re drowning in the corporate or agency world,&nbsp;suffocating from lack of clarity, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get&nbsp;<em>work</em>&nbsp;done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep – to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity… and scale it like never before.</p><p>Or, if you’ve tried the freelance thing, but found it challenging or simply not fun doing the sales and marketing piece to land new clients so you could provide yourself or your family with a steady income, this is your opportunity find a long-term home with an organization who cares and who will constantly put fun, meaningful and challenging projects on your plate to keep things exciting and interesting.</p><p>Or, if you’ve been at a fast-growing start-up, but they haven’t turned the corner and learned how to grow without the stress, how to deliver results without working past 5 p.m., how to not burn the candle at both ends, how to create a profitable business model that doesn’t depend on the whims of VC or PE world to provide the next round of funding… this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction.</p><p>Regardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day… AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we can’t wait to meet you.</p><p><strong>Who Are We and What’s the Company’s Background?</strong></p><p>Metabolic Living’s mission is to empower people to thrive EVERY day so they can enjoy life to the fullest. And our vision is to do this by making our metabolism-first lifestyle become the worldwide standard for healthy living. It’s a flexible, fun lifestyle that’s 100% focused on delivering the results that matter:&nbsp;<em>feeling</em>&nbsp;your best,&nbsp;<em>looking</em>&nbsp;your best and&nbsp;<em>performing</em>&nbsp;your best. In the shortest time possible.</p><p>It puts YOU back in control. It helps YOU understand how your body and metabolism works. It empowers YOU to fix your own problems. And because it alleviates the frustration and confusion so many of us experience when trying to fix our health, it makes you want to tell the world about it.</p><p>Our goal is to grow into a billion-dollar multi-channel brand that’s distributed via online, mobile and physical retail. For 10 years, we’ve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework, team and culture to make this happen. We have a robust, mature, complete and profitable business model with scalable customer acquisition. And now we’re pushing into a massive new growth phase.</p><p>We’ve built a full ecosystem of products that allow someone to live a&nbsp;<em>metabolism-first</em>&nbsp;lifestyle. This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods, memberships and coaching programs. We’re launching our mobile app later this year, then will push into offline retail, extend into home-delivered meals and more. But ONE thing at a time, just like we’ve done for 9 years.</p><p>Our next major step is rolling out our new&nbsp;<em>Metabolic Living</em>&nbsp;brand and centralized e-commerce website at www.metabolicliving.com, scheduled to be live in first half of 2020. We will consolidate into this centralized website our various product-branded microsites.</p><p>So why is a metabolism-first lifestyle needed?&nbsp;Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up around the world. We’re&nbsp;<em>over</em>-worked,&nbsp;<em>over</em>-stressed,&nbsp;<em>over</em>-fed and full of toxins. And we’re deprived of the sleep, nutrition, movement and relaxation we need to thrive.</p><p>Unfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise traps people into a 1-step-forward, 2-steps back vicious cycle that makes them&nbsp;<em>worse</em>&nbsp;off. They bounce from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making progress… trapped in a downward spiral of increasing desperation.</p><p>And philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create a rigid us-vs-them tribal mentality that’s self-limiting. Neither of those philosophies work for&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;people&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the time… or even the same person all the time. People differ. Bodies change. If that’s not respected, things will backfire.</p><p>The answer?&nbsp;Instead of trying to FIND the perfect program, you need to CREATE their own – one that respects how YOUR body works. And that’s where our metabolism-first&nbsp;<em>framework</em>&nbsp;comes in.</p><p>It empowers you with a repeatable, customizable method to optimize your metabolism. Because we’ve found through working with millions of people that&nbsp;<em>a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results everyone wants – feeling their best, looking their best and performing their best, EVERY day.</em></p><p>So, instead of fighting&nbsp;<em>against</em>&nbsp;your body and getting inconsistent results with a one-size fits all program or protocol, we teach you to work&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;your body to enjoy&nbsp;<em>consistent</em>&nbsp;results by building your OWN perfect customized program. One that’s practical, enjoyable and sustainable… and starts working fast.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>What Are the Major Objectives?</strong></p><ul><li>Build Out Team –&nbsp;Recruit, train and manage a high-performing tech team who seamless delivers against the company’s objectives while ensuring sufficient cross-training to be resilient</li><li>Launch e-Comm&nbsp;– Finish launching our new centralized e-commerce website at www.metabolicliving.com, which is 75% completed and ready for the final push</li><li>Build App –&nbsp;Create a state-of-the-art app that translates our metabolic optimization process into an easy-to-follow consumer-friendly experience that helps people get results</li><li>Manage Team to Hit KPIs&nbsp;– Coach each member of the team to create aggressive, yet achievable quarterly KPIs that create a competitive, yet collaborative culture that’s fun</li><li>Build Systems and SOPs&nbsp;– Establish uniformity through the development of SOPs, workflows and other systems so your team operates efficiently and effectively</li></ul><p><strong>What Are the On-going Responsibilities?</strong></p><ul><li>Strategy&nbsp;– Work with our product and marketing team to establish the overall vision and strategy to ensure our technology solutions deliver what’s best for the consumer</li><li>Analysis&nbsp;– Dive DEEP into usage data for our properties and apps to pinpoint areas of technical optimization to make everything run smoother, faster and better</li><li>Coding&nbsp;– Own whatever part of the stack makes sense for you to own based on your assessment of the team’s abilities, whether database layer, application layer, front-end, architecture, etc.</li><li>Project Management&nbsp;– You’ll be the single point of accountability for all major strategic projects, conducting daily huddles, building requirements and managing project plans</li></ul><p><strong>What Key Skills and Experience are Needed?</strong></p><ul><li>10+ Technical Management&nbsp;– Building, leading and managing tech teams who can consistently deliver on time, on spec and on budget in a collaborative, inspiring way</li><li>7+ Years Full-Stack LAMP Experience&nbsp;– Excels in every portion of dev and coding, whether database layer, application layer, front-end or anything in between in a LAMP stack</li><li>5+ Years Mobile / App Experience&nbsp;– Building and optimizing high-volume, consumer-facing apps on both iOS and Android with deep technical expertise to create mobile vision and strategy</li><li>3+ Years E-commerce Expertise&nbsp;– Heavy exposure e-commerce from building shopping carts to integrating payment processing to fulfillment, logistics and everything in between</li><li>AWS / Cloud Architect&nbsp;– Robust experience managing all facets of AWS, including Cloudfront, S3, EC2, ELB, IAM, RDS, and Autoscaling</li><li>Heavy Marketing-Systems Focus&nbsp;– With deep experience in A/B split testing, funnel development, analytics, page speed optimization, API integrations, etc.</li><li>Systems Architecture&nbsp;– Deep experience architecting systems that are scalable, resilient and secure within an environment of high volume data</li><li>Unquenchable Curiosity&nbsp;– It’s impossible for you to stop asking why, why, why… or what if, what if, what if… and you get very antsy, almost to the point of impatience, for the next test</li><li>Data-Driven&nbsp;– Extremely comfortable flexing the analytical side of your brain with a passionate for pouring through reams of response data to detect patterns of success to replicate</li><li>Systems-Oriented&nbsp;– You’ve got strong organizational skills and love to create order out of chaos with highly organized systems that deliver sustained success, regardless of who is in charge</li><li>Excellent Communicator&nbsp;– Able to clearly and concisely articulate positions both in written format and orally in 1-on-1 or group situations that build cohesion and gain alignment</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p><strong>What You’ll Enjoy from Us:</strong></p><ul><li>A Curated Team&nbsp;– A very supportive team of other high-performers who like to get things done, hold themselves accountable and help each other out wherever possible.</li><li>A Nurturing Culture&nbsp;– A culture that supports and nurtures your need to learn, grow and challenge yourself to be the best you possibly can be.</li><li>A Fantastic Lifestyle&nbsp;–&nbsp;A 100% remote experience&nbsp;that allows you to work from home, enjoy your family, outside interests and passions</li><li>A Robust Benefits Package&nbsp;— Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k + 15 days PTO and additional perks as we add them</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://apply.workable.com/metabolicliving/j/46A408E285/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

This means delivering a simple and accessible Care Platform for people who provide or receive care. We appreciate that healthcare across all corners of our planet is inherently challenging. We aim to use our time, our skills, our voice and our imaginations—to do something about it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We are a self-funded pre-launch health tech startup working towards a release in August 2020.&nbsp; We have a small 100% remote team, including two existing co-founders and several superstar developers. We take pride in our product-focused team culture, who are driven to deliver real value for our healthcare users.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><strong>We are seeking expressions of interest for the following roles:</strong>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Chief Growth Officer</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You will lead the development, execution and iteration of our growth strategy. We need your imagination and excellence to develop and unify sales, marketing and product capability towards a common purpose. You will know how to swing for the bleachers. When to take risks, channels to invest in and how to get the job done.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Healthcare is a complex industry, so you will need to be creative in your thinking and frugal in delivery to build a sustainable growth engine.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You will have demonstrated your capability to grow a SaaS product rapidly. You will be an expert in marketing, branding and sales.&nbsp; You are motivated by rolling up your sleeves and doing the work.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Chief Product Officer</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You will lead product, design and research at Carepatron - bringing people, data and technology together onto our platform. You will have a keen eye for design, creating the worlds best care technology experience.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As product lead, you will wrangle our team to coordinate and deliver an ambitious product roadmap. You will enjoy working across the business to allocate and champion everyone's contribution.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You have worked in or with an early-stage startup. You will have a robust design background with a strong understanding of product development. You will understand what it takes to create a successful SaaS product and be energised by the journey.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Chief Clinical Officer</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Driven by a strong sense of mission and purpose to help rethink healthcare technology, you will be the face and voice of Carepatron across our community. You have seen and have personally experienced frustrations through the lack of tools to help healthcare workers do their job safely and efficiently.<br><br></div><div>You will work closely with our growth, technology and product teams to help champion how we improve the lives of the users we serve. You will engage with our community through digital and in-person channels to better understand their needs and articulate the Carepatron solution.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You are probably a qualified nurse or doctor who has experience working across the healthcare sector. You will enjoy being the face of a product, with an excellent ability to communicate the mission and engage a range of stakeholders.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>About you</strong>&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>You will have a secure connection or interest in healthcare. You have personally seen or experienced the issues that exist across the world with how we organise and provide healthcare. You want to be part of an organisation that aims to be part of a global solution for this.&nbsp;</div><div><br>You can work from anywhere in the world because we know great people do fantastic work wherever they are.&nbsp;</div><div><br>You want to be part of a startup with big aspirations. You want to be a co-founder with a big piece of the pie.&nbsp;<br><br>You want to be part of a team with global ambitions.&nbsp;</div><div><br>You will want to do things differently.

We want someone to cultivate a high-performing, yet humble environment that treats people well. \\nPlus, weve ALWAYS been 100% virtual and all work from home and who doesnt want that right now? \\nHello, Im Marc Stockman, CEO and co-founder of Metabolic Living. Weve had some great developers, but never a true leader of all things tech because it hasnt been necessary. However, now it is. And Im looking for a true needle-in-a-haystack to sprint along side me as we execute on our next growth leg.\\nOur mission at Metabolic Living is to make our metabolism-first lifestyle the worldwide standard for healthy living. Even without the current pandemic, people struggle with their health, confused by so many competing options that dont get results. So, weve developed a simple process anybody can follow to optimize their metabolism to deliver the energy their body needs to thrive. \\nWe run on a LAMP stack on AWS, have a team of 3 developers (100+ people in company) and now need a senior tech leader to help us achieve our next growth target of $100MM and beyond. You have the opportunity to build out the perfect team the way YOU see fit. We do not yet have a mobile technical strategy in place, so this is an opportunity for you to define that as well. \\nThe ideal candidate is both a high-caliber, full-stack developer and systems architect who loves to code, as well as a fantastic manager who is very marketing- and consumer-oriented and business-savvy. We only want someone who has been there and done that as we have lots of wood to chop on the business end. We need to rely on a steady proven rock as leader of all things tech to get things done. \\nAnd its a HUGE plus if youre passionate about health and wellness :-) \\nYes, we know were asking for someone unique, but were putting this out there anyway to find the right candidate, with a robust compensation package to reflect this unique challenge. If youre interested, youll find the full story of our company below were only interested in talking to people who are inspired by this and want to be a part of this amazing journey were on. \\nIn spite of the crisis the world is in, were thriving, and in fact growing, because of the products and services we sell. Our goal is to build a $1 billion dollar consumer brand by 2023 and technology will play an enormously important role in achieving that. Were just putting the finishing touches on our re-branding efforts (more on that below) and will be launching our flagship e-commerce website in 2-3 months. That will be followed by a robust app that simplifies everything for consumers this Fall. \\nWere particularly excited about the app as it will be the future of the company as we integrate our propriety Metabolic OS and automate customized meal plans, workouts and lifestyle changes that truly reflect the uniqueness of each individual. And how that uniqueness changes over time in response to changes in your physiology, psychology, preferences and other lifestyle factors. \\nIf youre a proven tech leader who knows how to both build and manage a team in a fast-moving environment and is a truly high-caliber end-to-end full stack web and mobile developer and \\n * You LOVE to build things to perfection, but know how to iterate rapidly to gain traction\\n * You LOVE working on consumer-facing websites, applications and architecture\\n * You LOVE everything e-commerce-related and have deep experience in payments\\n * You LOVE building apps with the right tech so things just work flawlessly\\n * You LOVE to think, solve complex problems and get a rush when your builds go live\\n \\n \\nThen please read on as youre the ideal candidate and wed love to talk to you ASAP. \\nTo summarize the key points: \\n * Salary: $150,000 - $250,000\\n * Location: 100% Remote (virtual team of 100+ with no corporate office)\\n * Benefits: Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k\\n * Hours: 8:30 a.m. 5:00 p.m. (preferably Eastern time but flexible for right candidate)\\n * Culture: High-Performance but Humble (no jerks) that Creates Space for Deep Work\\n * Personality: Obsessed with Details so We can Simplify the Complex for Others\\n \\n \\nWho is This Opportunity Perfect for? \\nThis is the perfect opportunity for a tech leader who loves to roll up their sleeves and code, enjoys building teams and who has an unstoppable drive for excellence and might relate to any of these: \\nIf youre drowning in the corporate or agency world, suffocating from lack of clarity, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get work done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity and scale it like never before. \\nOr, if youve tried the freelance thing, but found it challenging or simply not fun doing the sales and marketing piece to land new clients so you could provide yourself or your family with a steady income, this is your opportunity find a long-term home with an organization who cares and who will constantly put fun, meaningful and challenging projects on your plate to keep things exciting and interesting. \\nOr, if youve been at a fast-growing start-up, but they havent turned the corner and learned how to grow without the stress, how to deliver results without working past 5 p.m., how to not burn the candle at both ends, how to create a profitable business model that doesnt depend on the whims of VC or PE world to provide the next round of funding this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction. \\nRegardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we cant wait to meet you. \\nWho Are We and Whats the Companys Background? \\nMetabolic Livings mission is to empower people to thrive EVERY day so they can enjoy life to the fullest. And our vision is to do this by making our metabolism-first lifestyle become the worldwide standard for healthy living. Its a flexible, fun lifestyle thats 100% focused on delivering the results that matter: feeling your best, looking your best and performing your best. In the shortest time possible. \\nIt puts YOU back in control. It helps YOU understand how your body and metabolism works. It empowers YOU to fix your own problems. And because it alleviates the frustration and confusion so many of us experience when trying to fix our health, it makes you want to tell the world about it. \\nOur goal is to grow into a billion-dollar multi-channel brand thats distributed via online, mobile and physical retail. For 10 years, weve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework, team and culture to make this happen. We have a robust, mature, complete and profitable business model with scalable customer acquisition. And now were pushing into a massive new growth phase. \\nWeve built a full ecosystem of products that allow someone to live a metabolism-first lifestyle. This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods, memberships and coaching programs. Were launching our mobile app later this year, then will push into offline retail, extend into home-delivered meals and more. But ONE thing at a time, just like weve done for 9 years. \\nOur next major step is rolling out our new Metabolic Living brand and centralized e-commerce website at www.metabolicliving.com, scheduled to be live in first half of 2020. We will consolidate into this centralized website our various product-branded microsites. \\nSo why is a metabolism-first lifestyle needed? Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up around the world. Were over-worked, over-stressed, over-fed and full of toxins. And were deprived of the sleep, nutrition, movement and relaxation we need to thrive. \\nUnfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise traps people into a 1-step-forward, 2-steps back vicious cycle that makes them worse off. They bounce from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making progress trapped in a downward spiral of increasing desperation. \\nAnd philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create a rigid us-vs-them tribal mentality thats self-limiting. Neither of those philosophies work for all people all the time or even the same person all the time. People differ. Bodies change. If thats not respected, things will backfire. \\nThe answer? Instead of trying to FIND the perfect program, you need to CREATE their own one that respects how YOUR body works. And thats where our metabolism-first framework comes in. \\nIt empowers you with a repeatable, customizable method to optimize your metabolism. Because weve found through working with millions of people that a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results everyone wants feeling their best, looking their best and performing their best, EVERY day. \\nSo, instead of fighting against your body and getting inconsistent results with a one-size fits all program or protocol, we teach you to work with your body to enjoy consistent results by building your OWN perfect customized program. One thats practical, enjoyable and sustainable and starts working fast.\\n\\nBenefits\\n\\nWhat You'll Enjoy from Us: \\n * A Curated Team - A very supportive team of other high-performers who like to get things done, hold themselves accountable and help each other out wherever possible.\\n * A Nurturing Culture - A culture that supports and nurtures your need to learn, grow and challenge yourself to be the best you possibly can be.\\n * A Fantastic Lifestyle A 100% remote experience that allows you to work from home, enjoy your family, outside interests and passions\\n * A Robust Benefits Package -- Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k + 15 days PTO and additional perks as we add them\\n \\n  </div> </div>",

We've become the &quot;best in class&quot; tool in our category by focusing on doing one thing and doing it very well. Founded in 2012, we now have over 20,000 happy customers around the world, and we employ 50 wonderful people.We're not VC-funded; we've been profitable since day one and there's no big exit plan. It's all about the journey and building something that will last forever. In 2017 we were the #3 fastest growing company in Australia, and while we've grown quickly, we've done it conservatively. Our business model is all around understanding our customers, building great software, backing it up with great support and customer service, and making it incredibly easy to discover, learn and use.Most of our team is based in Brisbane, Australia, where the company started, though we've spread to other parts of Australia, the US, UK, and Argentina. Because our team is distributed, everyone works from home most of the week, so we've built a remote-first culture.&nbsp;We hope that you'll do your best work while at Octopus, and we trust you to find ways to work that work best for you and invest in your journey. That means freedom to choose the best location from which to work each day: it might mean working from home, from an office, a cafe, or a co-working place, or some combination through the day - whatever makes you most productive and able to do your best work that day. We know that great knowledge workers need great tools, and we have various programs available including a program to choose your own laptop, and an allowance for setting up the ultimate home office set up. We have a helpful, personable approach to feedback (1:1's and 360 reviews from your peers), a professional development program that revolves around your career journey and preparing you for the future, and a standardized approach to salary &amp; job title reviews.Most importantly, we believe that what matters most in a job is the people you work with each day, knowing you're working on something that matters, where your work is appreciated, you have the opportunity to learn and grow, and where you have a manager that supports you. We work hard every day to ensure Octopus is a great place to work by those measures.            </div>        ",

It’s a clear definition of success at a specific point in time - and it’s our internal compass.</p><p>One of the three sections in our vision is dedicated to the culture we’re intentionally building. Part of it reads:</p><p>“We have also gained a reputation as one of the best places to work in the U.S. Limelight is primarily a remote company by design, with a physical presence in strategic locations. These workspaces share a consistent Limelight look and feel, and provide employees nearby or traveling through with the option for in-person collaboration. But regardless of where they’re working on a given day, our team members feel like they have the resources they need to be their most effective.</p><p>Across the board, our employees have a deep understanding of our market, solutions, customers and users. New hires often tell us that our onboarding was the best they’ve experienced, but the industry context we provide doesn’t stop there. We are consistently growing our knowledge through continuing education. We also invest in our employees’ potential through professional and leadership development. Whether it’s connecting someone with an incredible mentor or supporting their transition into management, we strive to set team members up for success in their roles. Employees have a clear path to growth and many of them want to take the next step of their career within Limelight. High retention has helped us build expertise and capacity throughout the company, and there is a strong sense of ownership in each department.</p><p>Not only do we retain strong contributors, we attract them. Our continuous recruiting process keeps our pipeline full of high caliber candidates who are drawn to our innovative approach. Working at Limelight is not for everyone; it’s for people who can get on board with fellow “A” players, and develop their talents to the fullest as we navigate the fast-moving rapids of a changing industry. Limelight is for people who embrace the challenge of solving hard problems to build something great. Everyone takes responsibility for communicating their needs, and we respect and support each other’s boundaries. Managers work with their directs to reconcile short term needs with long term sustainability. Employees at Limelight give their all, and they truly feel appreciated for it. They know that at the end of the day we care about each other as people, and whatever we’re facing, we’re not doing it alone.”</p><p><strong>Senior Product Marketer, Overview:</strong></p><p>This is an exciting opportunity for a master storyteller to define and communicate Limelight’s Enterprise Platform solutions to buyers and the market.

We believe awesome technology powers the best brands. So we build it. Our technology becomes the foundation upon which businesses scale their operations, escalate their marketing efforts and grow their sales. Most of the time we're building e-commerce engines. Other times we're architecting software. Regardless of what we’re making, it's always all digital.</div><div><br></div><div>Recent projects we’ve taken on range from designing and building a new admin panel for <a href='https://elliot.store/' rel='nofollow'>this innovative e-commerce SaaS company</a>, to leading the UX design efforts for <a href='https://www.tiffany.com/' rel='nofollow'>this Fortune 500 company</a>’s overhaul of all its e-commerce properties. We’re also a certified Shopify Plus Agency Partner, and so we do a lot of work using the Shopify platform. You can see the full range of client work/portfolio at <a href='https://www.vaangroup.com/' rel='nofollow'>our website</a>.

Unemployment has thus far doubled, with more people furloughed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Larks connects these two audiences by creating a marketplace that offers online social activities supplied by the community.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Our vision</strong></p><br /><p>Imagine a world where anyone interested in taking part in a club, activity or learning a new skill could do so easily from home. From cooking, reading, knitting, photography, nutrition and many more, you can invite existing friends to join your experience or make new friends through shared passions.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Imagine being able to launch a new activity or club centred around your passion, and make money out of it from home. The scope is enormous, the market in the millions and impact on people's mental and social well-being profoundly positive. There is currently no single place for people to easily find relevant and engaging online social activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Most online activity marketplaces are based around face to face activities, online there are many streamed instructional videos but few interactive experiences where you can genuinely engage with others. Larks is the first marketplace that makes it easy to list and find online, community-lead social activities.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>This is an opportunity to work on a greenfield project in an industry that is undergoing sector re-defining changes as we speak. Millions of people are socialising differently and have been forced to change their mindsets around online interactions and what it means to be part of a community. We&rsquo;re building the first home of online activities and communities as demand sky-rockets. This is an opportunity to join at the beginning and be a key part of an exciting and fast-growing project. We&rsquo;re an experienced team, working remotely with a strong culture. We have a large network of activity providers and have spotted this gap in the market through testing a live and successful MVP.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>About you&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ve deep experience in marketplace businesses either in developing or operating them and have worked for some of the biggest consumer marketplaces. You are passionate about our mission of building online communities and excited about how early-stage we are.</p><br /><p>There&rsquo;s some flexibility around how the role could be structured depending on experience and availability.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Apply</strong></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Drop us an email with your CV or just your linkedin profile and a brief note to explain why you&rsquo;re interested in this opportunity.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p>",

A small pivot has led to great product-market fit, and we now have acres of green field that need designing &amp; coding.</p><p>How we make money: If you own a building that leases to office or commercial tenants, you need insurance. This is true if the economy is growing or crumbling. And as a result of this mandatory nature, it has not evolved to use modern technology. Workflows are manual. Communication is messy and time-consuming. People often don’t know what they’re buying or why. Obie sells commercial real estate insurance in a new way, once which emphasizes transparency and human-centric automation.</p><p>For the engineering role: our stack is Typescript, Node, GraphQL, and React. You should have ample experience in at least one of these technologies. Several years in overall coding experience is preferred, although the quality of this experience will be valued more highly than its duration.</p><p>For the design role: we're looking for someone who knows how to take a product from 0 to 1. Experience with phasing and sequencing of key features is highly desirable. A nice to is experience designing complex, B2B workflows.</p><p>To apply (or if you're just curious) please email careers@obiecre.com.</p>",

We felt a little bit impersonal just throwing you right in there with words like &ldquo;revolutionizing&rdquo; and &ldquo;disrupting&rdquo;.</p><br /><p>As such, we want you to know that the person that wrote this job description apologises in advance for any clich&eacute;s, tropes or sudden-insecurity-driven-panic-attacks that you might find in the description below.</p><br /><p><strong>What is Impala?</strong></p><br /><p>Impala is making the process of booking hotel rooms ridiculously easy. We&rsquo;re providing hotels with a powerful data distribution infrastructure that transforms the way hotel guests across the world browse, book, stay and pay.&nbsp;<strong>Think Twilio for Travel.</strong></p><br /><p>We launched our original API product in January 2019 and since then have grown at - quite frankly - a ridiculous old clip. Our technology is already installed in hundreds of hotels worldwide, on six continents and categorises more than 1 billion data points. This has allowed us to bring forward our&nbsp;<strong>ambition to revolutionise the hotel distribution market and help empower millions of people across the globe</strong>.</p><br /><p>We are a growing remote-first team of exceptional people split across engineering, product and commercial that have built a thriving, active, supportive community.</p><br /><p><strong>Where is Impala going?</strong></p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re supported by some of the best investors in the business, the early-stage backers behind Deliveroo, PillPack, SecretEscapes, Zoopla, Trivago, Monzo, Travelperk, Transferwise, Airbnb, GetYourGuide, Omio, Spotify and more!&nbsp;</p><br /><p>They&rsquo;re on board because of the opportunity that lies before us -&nbsp;<strong>revolutionising a 1.6 trillion dollar market that&rsquo;s been out-of-date for 20 years.</strong></p><br /><p>They also share our vision of a future in which<strong>&nbsp;travel is seamlessly connected and relentlessly inventive.</strong></p><br /><p>Our vision is that within the next two years 10% of hotel bookings worldwide will flow through Impala technology, and the product that we&rsquo;re building will support the entire ecosystem of travel technology (we already have over a thousand companies signed up).</p><br /><p>Anyone travelling anywhere will interact with products powered by Impala and to achieve this we&rsquo;re growing the team extensively within the next year. Now is the most exciting time to be joining Impala as we go through a large push to scale up!</p><br /><p><strong>A brief overview of what you will be doing here:</strong></p><br /><p>Impala is on a mission to become the infrastructure that allows the Travel industry to thrive.</p><br /><p>Today, Hotels manage their occupancy by juggling lots of booking sources supplying bookings via all kinds of means. This includes bespoke rates, overbooking volumes, compound commissions and all manner of very manual and repetitive activities.</p><br /><p>As part of&nbsp;<strong>our mission to become the infrastructure that travel operates</strong>&nbsp;<strong>upon</strong>&nbsp;we want to&nbsp;<strong>empower Hotels to control how their rooms are sold and who sells them.</strong></p><br /><p><strong>We think Hotels should be able to optimise their occupancy</strong>, to dynamically control who books their rooms, at what volume, and at what rates. They should be able to have a clear view of this and ultimately control where their bookings come from.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>As Product Manager of Hotel Inventory Marketplace, your job will be to&nbsp;<strong>help Impala&rsquo;s hotel partners to have the final say on how their rooms are sold and who sells them.</strong></p><br /><p>Currently (and ridiculously) this simply isn&rsquo;t the case for millions of hotels across the world.&nbsp;Your job will be to help change that.</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be an industry expert, someone who knows exactly where the Distribution market is going and&nbsp;<strong>can conjure up the right resources to answer any partner questions simply and authoritatively in an instant.</strong></p><br /><p><strong>This is a totally unique PM role</strong>, heading up all of our hotel occupancy optimisation operations, helping our partners get the full picture of booking volume, guest details and rates.</p><br /><p>On top of that,&nbsp;<strong>you&rsquo;ll set your department goals</strong>, work&nbsp;<strong>cross-functionally</strong>&nbsp;to keep all of Impala in the loop on current partner projects and, most importantly,&nbsp;<strong>show hotel partners exactly how and why we can help.</strong></p><br /><p><strong>You should join us if:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>You&rsquo;re that perfect blend of&nbsp;<strong>rational yet creative, persistent yet approachable and data-driven yet instinctive.&nbsp;</strong></li><br /><li>You thrive on diving into seemingly chaotic problems and&nbsp;<strong>emerging with clear, actionable insight</strong>, (first of all you sound awesome, and second of all we want to meet you!)</li><br /><li>You're someone who can&nbsp;<strong>represent the customer</strong>&nbsp;in our business; someone who can communicate their concerns, wants and needs in a clear, concise way to engineers and account managers alike.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You can&nbsp;<strong>manage projects with clear set goals</strong>&nbsp;that help the Hotel industry advance, while also helping us meet Impala&rsquo;s broader company goals.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>We&rsquo;re looking for someone who is experienced in product development and management, has worked in collaboration with engineers,&nbsp;leadership being able to&nbsp;<strong>drive delivery, instil urgency, motivate</strong>&nbsp;and has been&nbsp;<strong>involved on a greenfield product from inception to launch.&nbsp;</strong></li><br /></ul><br /><p>If this sounds like you, then we need to talk!</p><br /><p><strong>Where will you work?</strong></p><br /><p>This would be ideally a London based position, but for the right candidate we would consider remote - this means you can work from&nbsp;<strong>anywhere +/- 2 hours of London</strong>&nbsp;timezone (and less than a 3 hour flight).</p><br /><p>We are a remote-first company, our whole engineering team is fully distributed!

The global market size for Learning and Development, in which we operate, is worth &pound;285b. Our target clients are medium to large companies within the professional services industry.</p><br /><p>eSwapp was one of 14 UK companies selected by the British government to go on a mission to the Netherlands on Artificial Intelligence in 2019, among other achievements. We are close to securing our first round of funding and are in active discussion with several potential clients to run a pilot.</p><br /><p>Our team has a combination of technical and commercial skills, having worked for multinational organisations such as GSK, Google, Goldman Sachs, Yale University&hellip; But most importantly, we all share the same vision to make eSwapp a global success.</p><br /><p>We get along very well as a team and even though we all work remotely (&lsquo;current&rsquo; setup, not because of the pandemic), we interact regularly through different channels (and meeting in person, you'd usually find us at TechHub London or Google for Startups during normal time).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>So far, our focus has been on product development and securing clients through personal network, and we have a very limited presence on social media. Currently only on LinkedIn, but we plan and aim to have a proper social media launch on LinkedIn,Twitter and other appropriate channels in the&nbsp;next couple of months, with yourself as the key driver.</p><br /><p><strong>About you:</strong><br /><br />* Experience&nbsp;in&nbsp;social media and how it works within the full marketing strategy, either from brand side or client side.<br /><br />* Managed and grown social media accounts through organic and/or paid campaigns, with priority given to those who have successfully grown organically, both users/followers and engagement.&nbsp;<br /><br />* Work&nbsp;part-time or full-time depending on your availability. You will work closely with CEO and Head of Creative (both with UK &amp; international experience in marketing and advertising for blue chip companies). You will own the eSwapp brand in social media, ensuring consistent branding messages across all networks.&nbsp;You will devise strategy for our social media in line with our brand personality and with our full business strategy. You will also manage a Social Media intern, who's responsible for day-to-day activities.<br /><br />We can offer you a fun and fulfilling remote working environment with like-minded people, new experience for you on your CV and a letter of reference after you complete your time with us and go back to your normal role. We also hope to remain friends and have a coffee with you when things normalise and establishments starts re-opening again (a proper barista coffee sitting down in a&nbsp;cafe, how we miss it!)</p><br /><p>Please send your CV and application by the 30th of April. We aim to conduct skype interviews as we go along and as soon as possible after receiving and reviewing your CV.</p>",
