They specifically have sought out Cratejoy, they understand what our company does and they feel some sort of affinity with the mission. They are hungry for knowledge and are looking to be challenged in new ways, perhaps they even aspire to start their own business one day – or maybe they already have and now they want to know how to start a high impact business next time. They obviously care about compensation but they aren’t just looking for the next higher title and a little pay bump from their current job. They are leaving their current company after making some sort of impact, rather than because they just seem to leave jobs every 18 months once they realize it wasn’t as exciting as they thought it would be.</p><p>They seem to be aware of who they are as a person, including their own weaknesses, and want the sort of direct feedback and coaching it takes to grow their skillset, into a better team member, and even into a better person. In general people they worked with in the past would say that they are the type of person that seems to make everything a little bit better and that adding them to any conversation made the conversation more interesting, rather than more frustrating.</p><p>They respect their peers and want to learn more from those around them, and they give people the benefit of the doubt. They don’t rush to condemn people and they don’t quietly judge, they seek to help their peers be their best. They don’t like to assign blame, but if they were to assign blame they’d be just as likely to assign it to themselves as anyone else.</p><p>They are hard working when they have a mission, but they aren’t just aimlessly working tons of hours for no particular reason. They care a lot about what it is that they are doing, and they don’t just blindly follow direction. They want and need to understand how their work connects with the mission of the company and once they do they take it on as their own mission in life. When looking to solve problems they are willing to go outside themselves, but only after doing the diligence necessary. They don’t like to waste anyone’s time – least of all their own.</p><p>They are quick to admit mistakes, and they don’t let ego leave them on the wrong side of an issue for very long (or very often). In their area of primary skillset they are very strong in it. They may have other weaknesses, which is okay as long as they are aware of them, but there is at least one or two things at which they are indisputably A+.</p><p><strong>About Cratejoy</strong></p><p>Cratejoy is the one-stop destination for all things subscription box. Where you subscribe to what you love, and sell what you’re passionate about.</p><p>We’re a Y Combinator and Capital Factory company and have raised a series A from CRV in California We’re very well funded and have been growing at a staggering rate every single month since launch. Cratejoy’s growth is rocket ship fast, and we’d love for you to be a big part of it.</p><p>Our aim is to make subscription as accessible as ebay or etsy make ecommerce today. Our vision is to bring the best business model in the universe to everyone on the planet.</p><p>There’s 3 pieces to that vision:</p><p>The first was our subscription commerce platform. Our seller tools. There was no consensus for how to run a subscription business. We had to design those tools and build them. We had to do it in a way that is accessible to average online merchant. If they were savvy enough to run an etsy store they should be more than savvy enough to run a cratejoy subscription.</p><p>The next piece was education. There really were no resources that taught merchants how to run a subscription business. We built subscription school which is a free education site we run. Our team has deep subscription commerce expertise. We write articles, post videos and host webinars to teach people how to run subscription businesses. We created a forum which puts merchants in an community where they support each other and learn together. In the space of a year we’ve become the unrivaled thought leaders inside of subscription commerce.</p><p>Finally, we’ve built the marketplace. This is a consumer destination site that sells subscriptions. Consumers arrive at Cratejoy and subscribe to our merchants. We cross-sell additional subscriptions to them. This is the piece that we wanted to get to. By creating the platform we were aggregating supply for the marketplace. The marketplace is the demand side of the equation. And the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts, these all tie back together to build the virtuous cycle that is the Cratejoy ecosystem.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/cratejoy/48933a67-e762-4056-a730-f54f0be0a7f9' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We’re now looking for an experienced, results-driven Growth Marketer to head up our performance marketing efforts.<br /><br />Over the last two years we’ve reinvented insurance from the ground up. And it’s working. Since launching Flock Cover (our pay-as-you-fly drone insurance app) we have on-boarded over 2,000 active users, maintaining exponential growth and delighting our customers in the process. We have embraced experimentation and tested exciting marketing initiatives, growing through a combination of partnerships, word-of-mouth, and online buzz. Now it’s time to take this up a notch. And that’s where you come in...<br /><br />You will be overseeing our paid and unpaid marketing activities, both online and offline.<br /><br />You’ll find and test new channels with a laser focus on our CPA, identifying and re-doubling efforts on whatever works.

Please explain (briefly) why you’re interested in this position and why you believe you’re the right person for this job, providing examples of your past achievements (if possible).<br />We will schedule you in for an initial 10-minute phone conversation with Antton (Product Lead and founder).<br />We will send over a short exercise for you to complete. This will test a range of skills, from technical to creative. No right or wrong answers here; we’re more interested in understanding your approach.<br />You will be invited for an engaging on-site interview where you will present your exercise answers to various members of the team, including Antton, and Ed (CEO).<br />Meet the entire team in a very casual setting for a friendly chat!<br /><br />Benefits <br /><br />Remuneration<br /><br />Competitive salary<br />Options: we want you to own the work that you do.

Just a pension.<br /><br />Work-life balance<br /><br />Large amounts of autonomy and empowerment in your work<br />Holidays: we offer 33 days of holiday per annum, including bank holidays.<br />Flexible working / working from home: we don’t have fixed working hours, some of our team start at 8am, others at 10am. We trust you to establish an effective working pattern that allows you to excel in your role and makes you a great Flock team member.<br /><br />Learning & Development<br /><br />Books, courses and conference budgets for all employees<br />Hackathons: we run a quarterly hackathon which lasts 24 hours. Everyone’s invited to join in.<br />Breakfast club: learn from your colleagues (or teach us something new!)<br /><br />Perks<br /><br />Friday fancy lunches: every Friday the entire Flock teams heads for lunch together. We call it ‘fancy lunch’. But sometimes it’s just at a pub.<br />Quarterly offsite adventures: every quarter the entire team do something crazy together. Like fly a plane to the coast.

    "content": "<h2>Marketing Account Coordinator at <span>Email Broadcast</span></h2><div><span><i></i> Remote</span>         | <span> Freelance </span> | <span> Part-time </span></div><div>            <p>What if you could control your own schedule, work from home, participate in strategic and creative marketing campaigns, and be a valued member of a kick-ass remotely connected team? Oh—you’ll also never be expected to work on Fridays. Yep. That’s right. Three-day weekends, every weekend. Sound like a dream? Pinch yourself. Email Broadcast is looking to hire a part-time, long-term Account Coordinator (and general marketing rockstar). Our Account Coordinators play a vital role here. They’re the connection between us and our clients; they’re in charge of keeping those clients happy; they’re the makers of amazing monthly email campaigns. This job is a permanent contractor role within our company. You’ll have plenty of flexibility to get your work done, but that comes with accountability. You should be generally available from 10 to 4, Monday through Thursday. This is when client meetings, team meetings, communication, and collaboration happen. If you have other commitments during this time, this isn’t a good fit. As an Account Coordinator, you’re going to be responsible for a handful of diverse clients (i.e., your accounts could include a high-end dermatology office or a remote fishing lodge). You’ll work on creating a monthly email campaign for them from start to send. This includes coming up with creative concepts, writing compelling copy, coordinating graphic requirements with our designer, A/B testing, requesting and tracking client approval, scheduling, reporting, and everything else in between. You’ll also attend weekly team meetings and occasional client calls, where you’ll share your ideas and contribute to discussions. To be successful, you need a blend of some specific skills:</p><ul><li><strong>Client wrangling.</strong>&nbsp;Whether you’re getting buy-in on a content idea, or tracking someone down for an approval; you should be a perfect balance of persuasive, professional, persistent, and personable.</li><li><strong>Project tracking.</strong>&nbsp;I.e., Can you juggle? More importantly: Can you focus? You’ll be working on several email campaigns for different clients all at the same time. You have to be able to transition from one project to the next without dropping the ball but disciplined enough to focus on each task and ensure high-quality completion.</li><li><strong>Marketing wizardry.</strong>&nbsp;You have experience and know-how to hook an audience with a headline, dazzle them with compelling copy, and persuade them to click, buy, sign up, stay tuned, or whatever else your campaign calls for!</li></ul><p>Still interested? See if the following describes you:&nbsp;<strong>WHAT YOU’RE LOOKING FOR</strong></p><ul><li><strong>12-20 hours per week of work.</strong>&nbsp;That’s about how much you’ll be working with a typical client load. Want more? Once you prove your marketing prowess, there’s plenty of internal projects we can add you to that will increase your hours. This job can grow into what you make it, but those 12-20 hours will be your primary priority. If what you really need is a full-time job to pay the bills, that’s cool, but this isn’t the right role for you.</li><li><strong>A long-term role.</strong>&nbsp;To be clear: This isn’t a freelance opportunity. If you’re used to piecing together one-off projects and short-term gigs, we’re not a good fit. The Account Coordinator is a permanent contractor role within our company.</li><li><strong>To be part of a team.</strong>&nbsp;Yes, you’ll do a lot of work on your own. But lone wolves need not apply. Each month you’ll be working with me, her, him, and them.</li><li><strong>Get paid more for efficiency.</strong>&nbsp;Your hourly rate will range from $20-$25. There is also a year-end bonus.</li></ul><p><strong>YOUR SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE</strong></p><ul><li>2+ years of hands-on marketing experience (email marketing is a huge plus!)</li><li>You write good. (Or is it “write well”? You should know the difference.)</li><li>Proven ability to meet and beat deadlines.</li></ul><p><strong>YOU’LL GET BONUS POINTS FOR</strong></p><ul><li>Graphic design skills</li><li>Knowledge of email marketing best practices</li><li>Familiarity with email platforms (MailChimp, Constant Contact, etc.)</li><li>Experience with Basecamp, Highrise, and Google Docs</li></ul><p><strong>NEXT STEPS</strong>&nbsp;So, how does that sound? If you think you’re the person we’re looking for, send your cover letter and resume to ACseptember2018[at]emailbroadcast.com. Please use the subject line “Your 2018 Account Coordinator.” Do not get creative here. This is how we sort the incoming mail. Consider your cover letter to be an example of your marketing skills—pitch yourself to us! Make sure you explain why you’re the perfect person for this position, why you’re interested, and how this&nbsp;<strong>part-time role</strong>&nbsp;will fit with your lifestyle.</p><p><strong>WHAT IS IT LIKE TO WORK FOR EMAIL BROADCAST?</strong></p><blockquote></blockquote>        </div><div>        <a href='mailto:ACseptember2018@emailbroadcast.com?subject=Application%20via%20%22Marketing%20Account%20Coordinator%22%20listing%20on%20https%3A%2F%2Fremote.co' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. Also, we work remotely (we all work from where we live). </p><p>&quot;Hashtags! Yay!&quot;</p><p>NO!!! </p><p>That's not actually what we're about. We build a suite of SaaS products for people and companies that expect social ROI: they need to get something back when they share to social.</p><p>RiteForge and RiteBoost do total social media optimization: images, custom visuals, link ads - and data-driven auto-hashtagging as well. For those who need to get business, sign-ups, or sales from what they share in Facebook, Twitter and beyond, RiteForge automates image creation and extraction, adds a call-to-action header to pages shared socially, and uses text analysis and machine learning to aid with hashtags as well.  </p><p>What is RiteKit?<br>The initial concept for RiteTag, our first product, was borne of the aftermath of the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. After witnessing the flurry of disorganized social media activity, our CEO and Founder wanted to help people get their social content discovered in an increasing noisy world.<br>What SEO does for web pages, SMO (social media optimization) does for video uploads, sound files, Facebook updates, Tweets... and it is much more than hashtags that does this. Today we continue to build tools to further our original mission to increase the customer's social media presence.</p><p>We build data-driven social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>What mktg/bizdev Interns (and staff) do:<br>• Learn far more than they teach in any university degree to prepare for a successful career in PR, Business Development or as an entrepreneur. (Best case scenario: after this internship you either launch your own startup, join one as a co-founder, or become so important to us that you create a position for yourself on our team.)<br>• Forge alliances with people at companies and startups that should be using our APIs and/or SaaS products<br>• Engage our growing community in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium and beyond.<br>• Write case study articles for our blogs.<br>• Do what it takes to get original articles on getting things done with RiteKit in major news sites and top-tier blogs.<br>• Learn how to win at marketing</p><p>Terms &amp; Requirements:<br>• Ability to learn and teach RiteKit products and coach a business owner to use them so that they get social ROI. This will be your entry exam and how you will qualify for the internship.<br>• Ability to collaborate in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>• Commitment: 6 months at 3-5 hours/week OR 12 months at 2~3 hours/week (decide later, no rush)<br>• Be okay with the internship being UNPAID. <br>• Must be well-written and have proven ability to create visual content<br>• No relocation needed; we work remotely</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers. </p><p>As a self funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends that have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time.</p></div>",

Through relentless customer development we’ve identified an enormous market opportunity for Content Operations (ContentOps).<br><br>ContentOps addresses the gap that exists between content strategy and publishing platforms/traditional CMS'.

You must be happy to take critique, self-improve and move forward.<br>* An iterative approach - We focus on learning and improving our processes as we go.<br>* Customer focus - You should always be thinking, “What can I be doing to deliver value to our customers?”<br>* Leave your ego at the door.
