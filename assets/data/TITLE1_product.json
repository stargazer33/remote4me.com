We design, manufacture, market and sell our own brands on Amazon.com. We are a market leader in many product categories such as sleeping bags, cots, ski gloves, ski goggles, running gloves, stand up paddles, surfing accessories, headwear and more.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Responsibilities:</strong></div><div>We’re looking for a highly quantitative, analytical, creative, curious and proactive person to join as our E-Commerce &amp; Conversion Rate Manager. In particular, we’re looking for someone to optimize the conversion rates of our 100+ products on Amazon in a scalable way.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>This role is highly multi-disciplinary, requiring you to wear several hats:</strong></div><ul><li>Product Manager: you’ll have to understand all our products and the various demographics that buy them</li><li>Business Analyst: you’ll have to go through our sales, conversion rate and traffic reports every week to identify struggling products, areas for improvement and sales trends</li><li>Creative Director &amp; Copy Editor: you’ll go through our products on Amazon, looking for opportunities to improve conversion rates through better model/lifestyle photos, videos and copywriting</li><li>Project Manager: you may set the vision and help manage large photo/video shoots of our products as we seek to improve the quality and conversion rates of all our listings<br><br></li></ul><div><strong>Here are a few specific things you will work on:</strong></div><ul><li>Track our products’ conversion rates and traffic by week and month, take action when necessary.

Is this a traffic or conversion rate issue?</li><li>Prioritize products based on their sales and conversion rate potential improvement.&nbsp;</li><li>Approve/edit/test copy: take the existing copy and edit/approve it. The copy should be a mix between informative, somewhat entertaining/personable, benefits (not features) oriented and keyword rich.&nbsp;</li><li>Continuously split test our images and copy to optimize conversion rates (note: we use splitly.com for our Amazon A/B testing)</li><li>Understand each product's customer demographics. Example: we found that an older demographic buys our white arm sleeves (for sun protection) while a younger demo buys our black sleeves (for sports like basketball and football). How do we appeal to each demographic?&nbsp;</li><li>Communicate issues with the Sales &amp; Marketing &amp; Creative teams to solve issues. Example: based on the competition, here are a few ideas on how we can improve conversion rates on this product</li><li>Ask the creative team to callout features about our product in the listing images. Example: many customer reviews rave about the sweatband liner on this hat. Can we add a photo of this sweatband?&nbsp;</li><li>Identify ways to improve our listings. Example: customers keep asking about whether this product works with soft-top surfboards. Can we include this in the listing?&nbsp;</li><li>Understand how the Amazon ranking algorithm works — the algorithm is an ever-changing black box. We must understand it as much as possible in order to maximize conversion rates</li><li>Track our product’s keyword rankings on Amazon to understand which searches are driving the most revenue for us on Amazon. What keywords are driving the revenue for us? On which keywords do we have to be #1 to maximize profit?</li></ul><div><strong>Your Experience at the Company:&nbsp;</strong></div><ul><li>You'll work directly with the CEO and Director of Operations</li><li>You will have access to all our sales and profitability reporting</li><li>You must be okay with morning or late evening calls to talk with the team in the Philippines or on the US East Coast</li><li>You will meet with your teammates 4 times per year in the Philippines.

    "content": "<p>Smart Migrator is an exciting and very disruptive tech startup (SaaS) based in London. We are revolutionising cloud migrations globally by building the world's first fully automated cloud migration platform. Everyone recognises that cloud computing is the future of IT. It can reduce costs, offer business agility and scalability and can be a platform for utilising countless opportunities, embracing the best of IT innovation.</p><br /><p>The journey to the cloud, however, is very complex and expensive. Most SMEs and even some large enterprises cannot afford the high cost to migrate. We are set to disrupt the global $120B market (expected to reach $448B by 2025) by offering the first of its kind solution that empowers companies of all size to make the critical transformational step. Our fully automated platform allows companies to migrate to the cloud 3-10x cheaper and 6-10x faster than traditional managed migrations services (from the likes of Accenture, IBM, DXC Technology and more).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We have built a very substantial MVP that automatically migrates Linux servers to AWS and we are currently fundraising so we can expand it to a full platform that has substantial capabilities and includes the other big clouds. In the current lockdown, fundraising has been put on hold but we are still actively looking to find companies that we can help migrate.</p><br /><p>In this sense, we are looking for marketing professionals who are currently furloughed and are curious to help spread the message for a unique innovative technology. This is mainly working on digital campaigns for social media. Ideally, we are looking for candidates with experience in B2B software or other tech (but not essential). What is essential is to have a creative vision and an outgoing personality.</p><br /><p>For now, we are only looking for furloughed volunteers. However, once we get funded, there would be permanent job opportunities for the right talent. We are a small, friendly and very passionate team spread across London, Sofia (Bulgaria) and Buenos Aires (Argentina).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>If what we are doing excites you and you are looking to add your mark and keep busy during the lockdown, we would love to hear from you. Keep safe :-)</p>",

We’ve had some great developers, but never a true leader of all things tech because it hasn’t been necessary. However, now it is. And I’m looking for a true needle-in-a-haystack to sprint along side me as we execute on our next growth leg.</p><p>Our mission at Metabolic Living is to make our metabolism-first lifestyle the worldwide standard for healthy living. Even without the current pandemic, people struggle with their health, confused by so many competing options that don’t get results. So, we’ve developed a simple process anybody can follow to optimize their metabolism to deliver the energy their body needs to thrive.</p><p>We run on a LAMP stack on AWS, have a team of 3 developers (100+ people in company) and now need a senior tech leader to help us achieve our next growth target of $100MM and beyond. You have the opportunity to build out the perfect team the way YOU see fit. We do not yet have a mobile technical strategy in place, so this is an opportunity for you to define that as well.</p><p>The ideal candidate is both a high-caliber, full-stack developer and systems architect who loves to code, as well as a fantastic manager who is very marketing- and consumer-oriented and business-savvy. We only want someone who has been there and done that as we have lots of wood to chop on the business end. We need to rely on a steady proven rock as leader of all things tech to get things done.</p><p>And it’s a HUGE plus if you’re passionate about health and wellness </p><p>Yes, we know we’re asking for someone unique, but we’re putting this out there anyway to find the right candidate, with a robust compensation package to reflect this unique challenge. If you’re interested, you’ll find the full story of our company below – we’re only interested in talking to people who are inspired by this and want to be a part of this amazing journey we’re on.</p><p>In spite of the crisis the world is in, we’re thriving, and in fact growing, because of the products and services we sell.&nbsp;Our goal is to build a $1 billion dollar consumer brand by 2023 and technology will play an enormously important role in achieving that.&nbsp;We’re just putting the finishing touches on our re-branding efforts (more on that below) and will be launching our flagship e-commerce website in 2-3 months. That will be followed by a robust app that simplifies everything for consumers this Fall.</p><p>We’re particularly excited about the app as it will be the future of the company&nbsp;as we integrate our propriety Metabolic OS and automate customized meal plans, workouts and lifestyle changes that truly reflect the uniqueness of each individual. And how that uniqueness changes over time in response to changes in your physiology, psychology, preferences and other lifestyle factors.</p><p>If you’re a proven tech leader who knows how to both build and manage a team in a fast-moving environment and is a truly high-caliber end-to-end full stack web and mobile developer and…</p><ul><li>You LOVE to build things to perfection, but know how to iterate rapidly to gain traction…</li><li>You LOVE working on consumer-facing websites, applications and architecture</li><li>You LOVE everything e-commerce-related and have deep experience in payments…</li><li>You LOVE building apps with the&nbsp;<em>right</em>&nbsp;tech so things “just work” flawlessly…</li><li>You LOVE to think, solve complex problems and get a rush when your builds go live…</li></ul><p>Then please read on as you’re the ideal candidate… and we’d love to talk to you ASAP.</p><p><strong>To summarize the key points:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Salary</em>: $150,000 – $250,000</li><li><em>Location</em>:&nbsp;100% Remote (virtual team of 100+ with no corporate office)</li><li><em>Benefits</em>: Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k</li><li><em>Hours</em>: 8:30 a.m. – 5:00 p.m. (preferably Eastern time but flexible for right candidate)</li><li><em>Culture</em>: High-Performance but Humble (<em>no</em>&nbsp;jerks) that Creates Space for Deep Work</li><li><em>Personality</em>: Obsessed with Details so We can Simplify the Complex for Others</li></ul><p><strong>Who is This Opportunity Perfect for?</strong></p><p>This is the perfect opportunity for a tech leader who loves to roll up their sleeves and code, enjoys building teams and who has an unstoppable drive for excellence and might relate to any of these:</p><p>If you’re drowning in the corporate or agency world,&nbsp;suffocating from lack of clarity, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get&nbsp;<em>work</em>&nbsp;done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep – to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity… and scale it like never before.</p><p>Or, if you’ve tried the freelance thing, but found it challenging or simply not fun doing the sales and marketing piece to land new clients so you could provide yourself or your family with a steady income, this is your opportunity find a long-term home with an organization who cares and who will constantly put fun, meaningful and challenging projects on your plate to keep things exciting and interesting.</p><p>Or, if you’ve been at a fast-growing start-up, but they haven’t turned the corner and learned how to grow without the stress, how to deliver results without working past 5 p.m., how to not burn the candle at both ends, how to create a profitable business model that doesn’t depend on the whims of VC or PE world to provide the next round of funding… this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction.</p><p>Regardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day… AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we can’t wait to meet you.</p><p><strong>Who Are We and What’s the Company’s Background?</strong></p><p>Metabolic Living’s mission is to empower people to thrive EVERY day so they can enjoy life to the fullest. And our vision is to do this by making our metabolism-first lifestyle become the worldwide standard for healthy living. It’s a flexible, fun lifestyle that’s 100% focused on delivering the results that matter:&nbsp;<em>feeling</em>&nbsp;your best,&nbsp;<em>looking</em>&nbsp;your best and&nbsp;<em>performing</em>&nbsp;your best. In the shortest time possible.</p><p>It puts YOU back in control. It helps YOU understand how your body and metabolism works. It empowers YOU to fix your own problems. And because it alleviates the frustration and confusion so many of us experience when trying to fix our health, it makes you want to tell the world about it.</p><p>Our goal is to grow into a billion-dollar multi-channel brand that’s distributed via online, mobile and physical retail. For 10 years, we’ve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework, team and culture to make this happen. We have a robust, mature, complete and profitable business model with scalable customer acquisition. And now we’re pushing into a massive new growth phase.</p><p>We’ve built a full ecosystem of products that allow someone to live a&nbsp;<em>metabolism-first</em>&nbsp;lifestyle. This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods, memberships and coaching programs. We’re launching our mobile app later this year, then will push into offline retail, extend into home-delivered meals and more. But ONE thing at a time, just like we’ve done for 9 years.</p><p>Our next major step is rolling out our new&nbsp;<em>Metabolic Living</em>&nbsp;brand and centralized e-commerce website at www.metabolicliving.com, scheduled to be live in first half of 2020. We will consolidate into this centralized website our various product-branded microsites.</p><p>So why is a metabolism-first lifestyle needed?&nbsp;Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up around the world. We’re&nbsp;<em>over</em>-worked,&nbsp;<em>over</em>-stressed,&nbsp;<em>over</em>-fed and full of toxins. And we’re deprived of the sleep, nutrition, movement and relaxation we need to thrive.</p><p>Unfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise traps people into a 1-step-forward, 2-steps back vicious cycle that makes them&nbsp;<em>worse</em>&nbsp;off. They bounce from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making progress… trapped in a downward spiral of increasing desperation.</p><p>And philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create a rigid us-vs-them tribal mentality that’s self-limiting. Neither of those philosophies work for&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;people&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the time… or even the same person all the time. People differ. Bodies change. If that’s not respected, things will backfire.</p><p>The answer?&nbsp;Instead of trying to FIND the perfect program, you need to CREATE their own – one that respects how YOUR body works. And that’s where our metabolism-first&nbsp;<em>framework</em>&nbsp;comes in.</p><p>It empowers you with a repeatable, customizable method to optimize your metabolism. Because we’ve found through working with millions of people that&nbsp;<em>a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results everyone wants – feeling their best, looking their best and performing their best, EVERY day.</em></p><p>So, instead of fighting&nbsp;<em>against</em>&nbsp;your body and getting inconsistent results with a one-size fits all program or protocol, we teach you to work&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;your body to enjoy&nbsp;<em>consistent</em>&nbsp;results by building your OWN perfect customized program. One that’s practical, enjoyable and sustainable… and starts working fast.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>What Are the Major Objectives?</strong></p><ul><li>Build Out Team –&nbsp;Recruit, train and manage a high-performing tech team who seamless delivers against the company’s objectives while ensuring sufficient cross-training to be resilient</li><li>Launch e-Comm&nbsp;– Finish launching our new centralized e-commerce website at www.metabolicliving.com, which is 75% completed and ready for the final push</li><li>Build App –&nbsp;Create a state-of-the-art app that translates our metabolic optimization process into an easy-to-follow consumer-friendly experience that helps people get results</li><li>Manage Team to Hit KPIs&nbsp;– Coach each member of the team to create aggressive, yet achievable quarterly KPIs that create a competitive, yet collaborative culture that’s fun</li><li>Build Systems and SOPs&nbsp;– Establish uniformity through the development of SOPs, workflows and other systems so your team operates efficiently and effectively</li></ul><p><strong>What Are the On-going Responsibilities?</strong></p><ul><li>Strategy&nbsp;– Work with our product and marketing team to establish the overall vision and strategy to ensure our technology solutions deliver what’s best for the consumer</li><li>Analysis&nbsp;– Dive DEEP into usage data for our properties and apps to pinpoint areas of technical optimization to make everything run smoother, faster and better</li><li>Coding&nbsp;– Own whatever part of the stack makes sense for you to own based on your assessment of the team’s abilities, whether database layer, application layer, front-end, architecture, etc.</li><li>Project Management&nbsp;– You’ll be the single point of accountability for all major strategic projects, conducting daily huddles, building requirements and managing project plans</li></ul><p><strong>What Key Skills and Experience are Needed?</strong></p><ul><li>10+ Technical Management&nbsp;– Building, leading and managing tech teams who can consistently deliver on time, on spec and on budget in a collaborative, inspiring way</li><li>7+ Years Full-Stack LAMP Experience&nbsp;– Excels in every portion of dev and coding, whether database layer, application layer, front-end or anything in between in a LAMP stack</li><li>5+ Years Mobile / App Experience&nbsp;– Building and optimizing high-volume, consumer-facing apps on both iOS and Android with deep technical expertise to create mobile vision and strategy</li><li>3+ Years E-commerce Expertise&nbsp;– Heavy exposure e-commerce from building shopping carts to integrating payment processing to fulfillment, logistics and everything in between</li><li>AWS / Cloud Architect&nbsp;– Robust experience managing all facets of AWS, including Cloudfront, S3, EC2, ELB, IAM, RDS, and Autoscaling</li><li>Heavy Marketing-Systems Focus&nbsp;– With deep experience in A/B split testing, funnel development, analytics, page speed optimization, API integrations, etc.</li><li>Systems Architecture&nbsp;– Deep experience architecting systems that are scalable, resilient and secure within an environment of high volume data</li><li>Unquenchable Curiosity&nbsp;– It’s impossible for you to stop asking why, why, why… or what if, what if, what if… and you get very antsy, almost to the point of impatience, for the next test</li><li>Data-Driven&nbsp;– Extremely comfortable flexing the analytical side of your brain with a passionate for pouring through reams of response data to detect patterns of success to replicate</li><li>Systems-Oriented&nbsp;– You’ve got strong organizational skills and love to create order out of chaos with highly organized systems that deliver sustained success, regardless of who is in charge</li><li>Excellent Communicator&nbsp;– Able to clearly and concisely articulate positions both in written format and orally in 1-on-1 or group situations that build cohesion and gain alignment</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p><strong>What You’ll Enjoy from Us:</strong></p><ul><li>A Curated Team&nbsp;– A very supportive team of other high-performers who like to get things done, hold themselves accountable and help each other out wherever possible.</li><li>A Nurturing Culture&nbsp;– A culture that supports and nurtures your need to learn, grow and challenge yourself to be the best you possibly can be.</li><li>A Fantastic Lifestyle&nbsp;–&nbsp;A 100% remote experience&nbsp;that allows you to work from home, enjoy your family, outside interests and passions</li><li>A Robust Benefits Package&nbsp;— Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k + 15 days PTO and additional perks as we add them</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://apply.workable.com/metabolicliving/j/46A408E285/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We want someone to cultivate a high-performing, yet humble environment that treats people well. \\nPlus, weve ALWAYS been 100% virtual and all work from home and who doesnt want that right now? \\nHello, Im Marc Stockman, CEO and co-founder of Metabolic Living. Weve had some great developers, but never a true leader of all things tech because it hasnt been necessary. However, now it is. And Im looking for a true needle-in-a-haystack to sprint along side me as we execute on our next growth leg.\\nOur mission at Metabolic Living is to make our metabolism-first lifestyle the worldwide standard for healthy living. Even without the current pandemic, people struggle with their health, confused by so many competing options that dont get results. So, weve developed a simple process anybody can follow to optimize their metabolism to deliver the energy their body needs to thrive. \\nWe run on a LAMP stack on AWS, have a team of 3 developers (100+ people in company) and now need a senior tech leader to help us achieve our next growth target of $100MM and beyond. You have the opportunity to build out the perfect team the way YOU see fit. We do not yet have a mobile technical strategy in place, so this is an opportunity for you to define that as well. \\nThe ideal candidate is both a high-caliber, full-stack developer and systems architect who loves to code, as well as a fantastic manager who is very marketing- and consumer-oriented and business-savvy. We only want someone who has been there and done that as we have lots of wood to chop on the business end. We need to rely on a steady proven rock as leader of all things tech to get things done. \\nAnd its a HUGE plus if youre passionate about health and wellness :-) \\nYes, we know were asking for someone unique, but were putting this out there anyway to find the right candidate, with a robust compensation package to reflect this unique challenge. If youre interested, youll find the full story of our company below were only interested in talking to people who are inspired by this and want to be a part of this amazing journey were on. \\nIn spite of the crisis the world is in, were thriving, and in fact growing, because of the products and services we sell. Our goal is to build a $1 billion dollar consumer brand by 2023 and technology will play an enormously important role in achieving that. Were just putting the finishing touches on our re-branding efforts (more on that below) and will be launching our flagship e-commerce website in 2-3 months. That will be followed by a robust app that simplifies everything for consumers this Fall. \\nWere particularly excited about the app as it will be the future of the company as we integrate our propriety Metabolic OS and automate customized meal plans, workouts and lifestyle changes that truly reflect the uniqueness of each individual. And how that uniqueness changes over time in response to changes in your physiology, psychology, preferences and other lifestyle factors. \\nIf youre a proven tech leader who knows how to both build and manage a team in a fast-moving environment and is a truly high-caliber end-to-end full stack web and mobile developer and \\n * You LOVE to build things to perfection, but know how to iterate rapidly to gain traction\\n * You LOVE working on consumer-facing websites, applications and architecture\\n * You LOVE everything e-commerce-related and have deep experience in payments\\n * You LOVE building apps with the right tech so things just work flawlessly\\n * You LOVE to think, solve complex problems and get a rush when your builds go live\\n \\n \\nThen please read on as youre the ideal candidate and wed love to talk to you ASAP. \\nTo summarize the key points: \\n * Salary: $150,000 - $250,000\\n * Location: 100% Remote (virtual team of 100+ with no corporate office)\\n * Benefits: Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k\\n * Hours: 8:30 a.m. 5:00 p.m. (preferably Eastern time but flexible for right candidate)\\n * Culture: High-Performance but Humble (no jerks) that Creates Space for Deep Work\\n * Personality: Obsessed with Details so We can Simplify the Complex for Others\\n \\n \\nWho is This Opportunity Perfect for? \\nThis is the perfect opportunity for a tech leader who loves to roll up their sleeves and code, enjoys building teams and who has an unstoppable drive for excellence and might relate to any of these: \\nIf youre drowning in the corporate or agency world, suffocating from lack of clarity, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get work done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity and scale it like never before. \\nOr, if youve tried the freelance thing, but found it challenging or simply not fun doing the sales and marketing piece to land new clients so you could provide yourself or your family with a steady income, this is your opportunity find a long-term home with an organization who cares and who will constantly put fun, meaningful and challenging projects on your plate to keep things exciting and interesting. \\nOr, if youve been at a fast-growing start-up, but they havent turned the corner and learned how to grow without the stress, how to deliver results without working past 5 p.m., how to not burn the candle at both ends, how to create a profitable business model that doesnt depend on the whims of VC or PE world to provide the next round of funding this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction. \\nRegardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we cant wait to meet you. \\nWho Are We and Whats the Companys Background? \\nMetabolic Livings mission is to empower people to thrive EVERY day so they can enjoy life to the fullest. And our vision is to do this by making our metabolism-first lifestyle become the worldwide standard for healthy living. Its a flexible, fun lifestyle thats 100% focused on delivering the results that matter: feeling your best, looking your best and performing your best. In the shortest time possible. \\nIt puts YOU back in control. It helps YOU understand how your body and metabolism works. It empowers YOU to fix your own problems. And because it alleviates the frustration and confusion so many of us experience when trying to fix our health, it makes you want to tell the world about it. \\nOur goal is to grow into a billion-dollar multi-channel brand thats distributed via online, mobile and physical retail. For 10 years, weve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework, team and culture to make this happen. We have a robust, mature, complete and profitable business model with scalable customer acquisition. And now were pushing into a massive new growth phase. \\nWeve built a full ecosystem of products that allow someone to live a metabolism-first lifestyle. This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods, memberships and coaching programs. Were launching our mobile app later this year, then will push into offline retail, extend into home-delivered meals and more. But ONE thing at a time, just like weve done for 9 years. \\nOur next major step is rolling out our new Metabolic Living brand and centralized e-commerce website at www.metabolicliving.com, scheduled to be live in first half of 2020. We will consolidate into this centralized website our various product-branded microsites. \\nSo why is a metabolism-first lifestyle needed? Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up around the world. Were over-worked, over-stressed, over-fed and full of toxins. And were deprived of the sleep, nutrition, movement and relaxation we need to thrive. \\nUnfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise traps people into a 1-step-forward, 2-steps back vicious cycle that makes them worse off. They bounce from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making progress trapped in a downward spiral of increasing desperation. \\nAnd philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create a rigid us-vs-them tribal mentality thats self-limiting. Neither of those philosophies work for all people all the time or even the same person all the time. People differ. Bodies change. If thats not respected, things will backfire. \\nThe answer? Instead of trying to FIND the perfect program, you need to CREATE their own one that respects how YOUR body works. And thats where our metabolism-first framework comes in. \\nIt empowers you with a repeatable, customizable method to optimize your metabolism. Because weve found through working with millions of people that a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results everyone wants feeling their best, looking their best and performing their best, EVERY day. \\nSo, instead of fighting against your body and getting inconsistent results with a one-size fits all program or protocol, we teach you to work with your body to enjoy consistent results by building your OWN perfect customized program. One thats practical, enjoyable and sustainable and starts working fast.\\n\\nBenefits\\n\\nWhat You'll Enjoy from Us: \\n * A Curated Team - A very supportive team of other high-performers who like to get things done, hold themselves accountable and help each other out wherever possible.\\n * A Nurturing Culture - A culture that supports and nurtures your need to learn, grow and challenge yourself to be the best you possibly can be.\\n * A Fantastic Lifestyle A 100% remote experience that allows you to work from home, enjoy your family, outside interests and passions\\n * A Robust Benefits Package -- Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k + 15 days PTO and additional perks as we add them\\n \\n  </div> </div>",

We've become the &quot;best in class&quot; tool in our category by focusing on doing one thing and doing it very well. Founded in 2012, we now have over 20,000 happy customers around the world, and we employ 50 wonderful people.We're not VC-funded; we've been profitable since day one and there's no big exit plan. It's all about the journey and building something that will last forever. In 2017 we were the #3 fastest growing company in Australia, and while we've grown quickly, we've done it conservatively. Our business model is all around understanding our customers, building great software, backing it up with great support and customer service, and making it incredibly easy to discover, learn and use.Most of our team is based in Brisbane, Australia, where the company started, though we've spread to other parts of Australia, the US, UK, and Argentina. Because our team is distributed, everyone works from home most of the week, so we've built a remote-first culture.&nbsp;We hope that you'll do your best work while at Octopus, and we trust you to find ways to work that work best for you and invest in your journey. That means freedom to choose the best location from which to work each day: it might mean working from home, from an office, a cafe, or a co-working place, or some combination through the day - whatever makes you most productive and able to do your best work that day. We know that great knowledge workers need great tools, and we have various programs available including a program to choose your own laptop, and an allowance for setting up the ultimate home office set up. We have a helpful, personable approach to feedback (1:1's and 360 reviews from your peers), a professional development program that revolves around your career journey and preparing you for the future, and a standardized approach to salary &amp; job title reviews.Most importantly, we believe that what matters most in a job is the people you work with each day, knowing you're working on something that matters, where your work is appreciated, you have the opportunity to learn and grow, and where you have a manager that supports you. We work hard every day to ensure Octopus is a great place to work by those measures.            </div>        ",

It’s a clear definition of success at a specific point in time - and it’s our internal compass.</p><p>One of the three sections in our vision is dedicated to the culture we’re intentionally building. Part of it reads:</p><p>“We have also gained a reputation as one of the best places to work in the U.S. Limelight is primarily a remote company by design, with a physical presence in strategic locations. These workspaces share a consistent Limelight look and feel, and provide employees nearby or traveling through with the option for in-person collaboration. But regardless of where they’re working on a given day, our team members feel like they have the resources they need to be their most effective.</p><p>Across the board, our employees have a deep understanding of our market, solutions, customers and users. New hires often tell us that our onboarding was the best they’ve experienced, but the industry context we provide doesn’t stop there. We are consistently growing our knowledge through continuing education. We also invest in our employees’ potential through professional and leadership development. Whether it’s connecting someone with an incredible mentor or supporting their transition into management, we strive to set team members up for success in their roles. Employees have a clear path to growth and many of them want to take the next step of their career within Limelight. High retention has helped us build expertise and capacity throughout the company, and there is a strong sense of ownership in each department.</p><p>Not only do we retain strong contributors, we attract them. Our continuous recruiting process keeps our pipeline full of high caliber candidates who are drawn to our innovative approach. Working at Limelight is not for everyone; it’s for people who can get on board with fellow “A” players, and develop their talents to the fullest as we navigate the fast-moving rapids of a changing industry. Limelight is for people who embrace the challenge of solving hard problems to build something great. Everyone takes responsibility for communicating their needs, and we respect and support each other’s boundaries. Managers work with their directs to reconcile short term needs with long term sustainability. Employees at Limelight give their all, and they truly feel appreciated for it. They know that at the end of the day we care about each other as people, and whatever we’re facing, we’re not doing it alone.”</p><p><strong>Senior Product Marketer, Overview:</strong></p><p>This is an exciting opportunity for a master storyteller to define and communicate Limelight’s Enterprise Platform solutions to buyers and the market.

Unemployment has thus far doubled, with more people furloughed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Larks connects these two audiences by creating a marketplace that offers online social activities supplied by the community.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Our vision</strong></p><br /><p>Imagine a world where anyone interested in taking part in a club, activity or learning a new skill could do so easily from home. From cooking, reading, knitting, photography, nutrition and many more, you can invite existing friends to join your experience or make new friends through shared passions.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Imagine being able to launch a new activity or club centred around your passion, and make money out of it from home. The scope is enormous, the market in the millions and impact on people's mental and social well-being profoundly positive. There is currently no single place for people to easily find relevant and engaging online social activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Most online activity marketplaces are based around face to face activities, online there are many streamed instructional videos but few interactive experiences where you can genuinely engage with others. Larks is the first marketplace that makes it easy to list and find online, community-lead social activities.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>This is an opportunity to work on a greenfield project in an industry that is undergoing sector re-defining changes as we speak. Millions of people are socialising differently and have been forced to change their mindsets around online interactions and what it means to be part of a community. We&rsquo;re building the first home of online activities and communities as demand sky-rockets. This is an opportunity to join at the beginning and be a key part of an exciting and fast-growing project. We&rsquo;re an experienced team, working remotely with a strong culture. We have a large network of activity providers and have spotted this gap in the market through testing a live and successful MVP.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>About you&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ve deep experience in marketplace businesses either in developing or operating them and have worked for some of the biggest consumer marketplaces. You are passionate about our mission of building online communities and excited about how early-stage we are.</p><br /><p>There&rsquo;s some flexibility around how the role could be structured depending on experience and availability.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Apply</strong></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Drop us an email with your CV or just your linkedin profile and a brief note to explain why you&rsquo;re interested in this opportunity.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p>",

A small pivot has led to great product-market fit, and we now have acres of green field that need designing &amp; coding.</p><p>How we make money: If you own a building that leases to office or commercial tenants, you need insurance. This is true if the economy is growing or crumbling. And as a result of this mandatory nature, it has not evolved to use modern technology. Workflows are manual. Communication is messy and time-consuming. People often don’t know what they’re buying or why. Obie sells commercial real estate insurance in a new way, once which emphasizes transparency and human-centric automation.</p><p>For the engineering role: our stack is Typescript, Node, GraphQL, and React. You should have ample experience in at least one of these technologies. Several years in overall coding experience is preferred, although the quality of this experience will be valued more highly than its duration.</p><p>For the design role: we're looking for someone who knows how to take a product from 0 to 1. Experience with phasing and sequencing of key features is highly desirable. A nice to is experience designing complex, B2B workflows.</p><p>To apply (or if you're just curious) please email careers@obiecre.com.</p>",

We felt a little bit impersonal just throwing you right in there with words like &ldquo;revolutionizing&rdquo; and &ldquo;disrupting&rdquo;.</p><br /><p>As such, we want you to know that the person that wrote this job description apologises in advance for any clich&eacute;s, tropes or sudden-insecurity-driven-panic-attacks that you might find in the description below.</p><br /><p><strong>What is Impala?</strong></p><br /><p>Impala is making the process of booking hotel rooms ridiculously easy. We&rsquo;re providing hotels with a powerful data distribution infrastructure that transforms the way hotel guests across the world browse, book, stay and pay.&nbsp;<strong>Think Twilio for Travel.</strong></p><br /><p>We launched our original API product in January 2019 and since then have grown at - quite frankly - a ridiculous old clip. Our technology is already installed in hundreds of hotels worldwide, on six continents and categorises more than 1 billion data points. This has allowed us to bring forward our&nbsp;<strong>ambition to revolutionise the hotel distribution market and help empower millions of people across the globe</strong>.</p><br /><p>We are a growing remote-first team of exceptional people split across engineering, product and commercial that have built a thriving, active, supportive community.</p><br /><p><strong>Where is Impala going?</strong></p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re supported by some of the best investors in the business, the early-stage backers behind Deliveroo, PillPack, SecretEscapes, Zoopla, Trivago, Monzo, Travelperk, Transferwise, Airbnb, GetYourGuide, Omio, Spotify and more!&nbsp;</p><br /><p>They&rsquo;re on board because of the opportunity that lies before us -&nbsp;<strong>revolutionising a 1.6 trillion dollar market that&rsquo;s been out-of-date for 20 years.</strong></p><br /><p>They also share our vision of a future in which<strong>&nbsp;travel is seamlessly connected and relentlessly inventive.</strong></p><br /><p>Our vision is that within the next two years 10% of hotel bookings worldwide will flow through Impala technology, and the product that we&rsquo;re building will support the entire ecosystem of travel technology (we already have over a thousand companies signed up).</p><br /><p>Anyone travelling anywhere will interact with products powered by Impala and to achieve this we&rsquo;re growing the team extensively within the next year. Now is the most exciting time to be joining Impala as we go through a large push to scale up!</p><br /><p><strong>A brief overview of what you will be doing here:</strong></p><br /><p>Impala is on a mission to become the infrastructure that allows the Travel industry to thrive.</p><br /><p>Today, Hotels manage their occupancy by juggling lots of booking sources supplying bookings via all kinds of means. This includes bespoke rates, overbooking volumes, compound commissions and all manner of very manual and repetitive activities.</p><br /><p>As part of&nbsp;<strong>our mission to become the infrastructure that travel operates</strong>&nbsp;<strong>upon</strong>&nbsp;we want to&nbsp;<strong>empower Hotels to control how their rooms are sold and who sells them.</strong></p><br /><p><strong>We think Hotels should be able to optimise their occupancy</strong>, to dynamically control who books their rooms, at what volume, and at what rates. They should be able to have a clear view of this and ultimately control where their bookings come from.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>As Product Manager of Hotel Inventory Marketplace, your job will be to&nbsp;<strong>help Impala&rsquo;s hotel partners to have the final say on how their rooms are sold and who sells them.</strong></p><br /><p>Currently (and ridiculously) this simply isn&rsquo;t the case for millions of hotels across the world.&nbsp;Your job will be to help change that.</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be an industry expert, someone who knows exactly where the Distribution market is going and&nbsp;<strong>can conjure up the right resources to answer any partner questions simply and authoritatively in an instant.</strong></p><br /><p><strong>This is a totally unique PM role</strong>, heading up all of our hotel occupancy optimisation operations, helping our partners get the full picture of booking volume, guest details and rates.</p><br /><p>On top of that,&nbsp;<strong>you&rsquo;ll set your department goals</strong>, work&nbsp;<strong>cross-functionally</strong>&nbsp;to keep all of Impala in the loop on current partner projects and, most importantly,&nbsp;<strong>show hotel partners exactly how and why we can help.</strong></p><br /><p><strong>You should join us if:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>You&rsquo;re that perfect blend of&nbsp;<strong>rational yet creative, persistent yet approachable and data-driven yet instinctive.&nbsp;</strong></li><br /><li>You thrive on diving into seemingly chaotic problems and&nbsp;<strong>emerging with clear, actionable insight</strong>, (first of all you sound awesome, and second of all we want to meet you!)</li><br /><li>You're someone who can&nbsp;<strong>represent the customer</strong>&nbsp;in our business; someone who can communicate their concerns, wants and needs in a clear, concise way to engineers and account managers alike.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You can&nbsp;<strong>manage projects with clear set goals</strong>&nbsp;that help the Hotel industry advance, while also helping us meet Impala&rsquo;s broader company goals.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>We&rsquo;re looking for someone who is experienced in product development and management, has worked in collaboration with engineers,&nbsp;leadership being able to&nbsp;<strong>drive delivery, instil urgency, motivate</strong>&nbsp;and has been&nbsp;<strong>involved on a greenfield product from inception to launch.&nbsp;</strong></li><br /></ul><br /><p>If this sounds like you, then we need to talk!</p><br /><p><strong>Where will you work?</strong></p><br /><p>This would be ideally a London based position, but for the right candidate we would consider remote - this means you can work from&nbsp;<strong>anywhere +/- 2 hours of London</strong>&nbsp;timezone (and less than a 3 hour flight).</p><br /><p>We are a remote-first company, our whole engineering team is fully distributed! This was a very deliberate choice to prioritise work-life balance and ensure we&rsquo;re able to accommodate the best people in Europe, whilst fostering diversity.</p><br /><p>Please note, we only accept candidates in Western Europe because of timezone and travel time differences. We make no exceptions (we don&rsquo;t have time to!).&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>What you will get in return?&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>We reward Impalans with super competitive salaries and regular reviews. Whether you're an individual contributor or you want to manage people, there's plenty of opportunity to develop your skills and boost your earning potential. We offer&nbsp;<strong>3.5x the average annual raise</strong>&nbsp;in the UK, even if you remain within the same role.</li><br /><li>We&rsquo;re in the top 14% of companies in the UK for the amount of holiday that we offer, at&nbsp;<strong>36 days</strong>.</li><br /><li><strong>One</strong><a href='https://unsickday.com/'><strong>&nbsp;Unsick</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;day</strong>&nbsp;off per year, to keep up with proactive health admin - so you can finally sort that trip to the dentist and get those health screens that you never have time to do.</li><br /><li><strong>Truly flexible working</strong>.
