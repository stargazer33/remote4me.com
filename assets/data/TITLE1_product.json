RAN uses nonviolent direct action, grassroots organizing, and strategic communications to challenge corporations to stop destructive operations, respect human rights, and adopt comprehensive policies to reduce their contributions to climate change. We take leadership from grassroots and Indigenous movements and are currently developing our organization-wide racial justice lens.</p><p>RAN’s Forest Program fights for the health of the world’s rainforests, and the people and species which rely on them for survival. We stand up to the biggest corporations in the world, the companies putting profits over people and the planet as a matter of business. When human rights are abused, when child and forced labor is an everyday tactic, where land is stolen from Indigenous Peoples so multi-national mega-corporations can destroy forests with impunity, we’ll be there fighting the root causes of deforestation.</p><p>RAN believes that people acting together can change this, as we have seen time and again throughout history.</p><p><strong>Position Summary:</strong></p><p>RAN has an opening for a full-time position on our Digital Engagement Team for a Digital Campaign Strategist for the Forest Program.

Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>What mktg/bizdev Interns (and staff) do:<br>• Learn far more than they teach in any university degree to prepare for a successful career in PR, Business Development or as an entrepreneur. (Best case scenario: after this internship you either launch your own startup, join one as a co-founder, or become so important to us that you create a position for yourself on our team.)<br>• Forge alliances with people at companies and startups that should be using our APIs and/or SaaS products<br>• Engage our growing community in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium and beyond.<br>• Write case study articles for our blogs.<br>• Do what it takes to get original articles on getting things done with RiteKit in major news sites and top-tier blogs.<br>• Learn how to win at marketing</p><p>Terms &amp; Requirements:<br>• Ability to learn and teach RiteKit products and coach a business owner to use them so that they get social ROI. This will be your entry exam and how you will qualify for the internship.<br>• Ability to collaborate in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>• Commitment: 6 months at 3-5 hours/week OR 12 months at 2~3 hours/week (decide later, no rush)<br>• Be okay with the internship being UNPAID. <br>• Must be well-written and have proven ability to create visual content<br>• No relocation needed; we work remotely</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers. </p><p>As a self funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends that have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time.</p></div>",

We are a skills-based hiring platform that helps companies evaluate technical skills, better. We’re driving a new paradigm shift by eliminating resumes and creating opportunities for hundreds of thousands of programmers worldwide. We have a community of 3.5M developers and 1,000 customers across industries, and the best part is we are just getting started. Our customers – &nbsp;including VMware, Twitter, Capital One, and many other Fortune 100 companies – rely on HackerRank to build strong engineering teams.</p><p>We’ve assembled an amazing team that’s passionate about creating more opportunities for people by changing the way companies hire. We showcase extreme ownership and are data-driven&nbsp;, and we love delighting customers. If you’re interested in scaling HackerRank by working with some of the largest companies in the world, let’s talk.</p><a href='https://www.ted.com/talks/adam_grant_are_you_a_giver_or_a_taker' rel='nofollow'>givers</a><p>HackerRank is hiring a leader to build a system for creating Computer Science challenges. Our mission at HackerRank is to match every developer to the right job, with the underlying driver being skill vs resumes. We are doing millions of developer assessments every quarter with customers across different industries from the internet, banking, retail, to automobile, that are using us for their entire technical recruiting process. What this means is, we are building an interesting data asset on the DNA for a {job role, company} and the DNA for a developer that helps us recommend the right jobs. We are consistently evolving every year to make the matching algorithm better.</p><p>One of the important parts of the matching algorithm is designing the right CS challenge that is both high quality &amp; relevant to the job role that’s being assessed. The CS challenges (referred to as content going forward) is a core part of HackerRank. It helps us assess the skills of a developer in different areas.</p><p>We are looking for a leader who’s passionate about solving the problem of matching developers to the right job and has a developer mindset ready to build this.</p><p></p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL LOVE TO DO…</strong><p>You will manage &amp; lead all content engineering efforts on HackerRank. This includes:</p><p>This involves building the overall strategy of what types of CS challenges should be built? taxonomy, type of challenges, the timeline to ship &amp; owning the entire process end-to-end. Some of the strategies might change due to external market demands.</p><strong></strong><u>Content strategy:</u><u>&nbsp;</u><p>: Moving from the Encarta model (generating a small number of challenges from a small set of experts) to Wikipedia model (generating a large number of challenges from the 3m+ developer community). Building this will come with its own challenges of ensuring we can retain quality and the right incentives at scale. This would involve building the right framework to manage the hundreds/thousands of challenge contributors and also managing a small team of curators</p><strong></strong><u>Building a system of crowdsourced generation of challenges</u><p>&nbsp;There’s a difference between Quora answers vs Y! answers. Ensuring we have the right quality framework (for e.g. grammatically correct, crisp problem statements, relevant to the job role, code stubs present to make it easy for developers to get started, etc.) and continuously improving for all challenges is important. HackerRank challenges should be synonymous with HQ CS challenges.</p><strong></strong><u>Quality control:</u><p></p><strong>GET EXCITED. Because you’re about to have a huge impact.</strong><p>HackerRank is growing fast and we’re having a great time working together as we build! We’re a fun, friendly, passionate bunch. We’re a team of teams and we’re looking for more smiling faces to come to join us! The position is full-time and while we would want this person to be ideally in Bangalore or Palo Alto, for the right person, a remote position is OK too</p><div> <div><div><p> <br><br> <b>To apply for this job please visit the URL below.</b> <br><br> Please reference <b>Jobspresso</b> in your job application, so that remote companies know where their best candidates are coming from  <br><br> <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/hackerrank/jobs/1110018' rel='nofollow'>https://boards.greenhouse.io/hackerrank/jobs/1110018 →</a></p></div></div></div>",

    "content": "JOB TYPE: Part Time<br /><br />EXPERIENCE: beginner<br /><br />COMPANY: Invalley; 1-10 employees; 50-75% remote;<br /><br />Invalley is offering an exciting job opportunity for a new campaign manager to join our super-talented and friendly team. The right candidate will have the opportunity to work remotely from anywhere in the world, with a fully flexible schedule and plenty of room for professional development.<br /><br />If this sounds like something you’d be interested in, read on for all the details.<br /><br />Who Are We and What Do We Do?<br /><br />Let us start by introducing ourselves. We’re an SEO company based in Nijmegen, the Netherlands (the oldest city in our country) which provides innovative link-building campaigns for customers all across the world. For over 8 years, we’ve been helping all types of clients - from small digital agencies to large fortune 500 media companies - to improve their ranking in the SERPs through our website invalley.com.<br /><br />What Will You Do?<br /><br />As a campaign manager, you’ll be responsible for ensuring that our link-building campaigns are carried out perfectly. To do this, you’ll manage a team of high-quality link builders and content writers as they create and distribute the content. Once the campaign is complete, you’ll also send the final report to the client. <br /><br />There are 5 key tasks that our campaign managers need to complete: <br /><br />●    Planning/Outsourcing: using our collaboration tool Monday.com, you will plan the campaign and ensure that the right content writers and link builders are assigned to the appropriate tasks. <br />●    Team support: you’ll support a team of link builders and content writers, answer any questions they may have, and make sure deadlines are met. <br />●    Quality check: you’ll check whether our team conducts every campaign task correctly.<br />●    Report delivery: you’ll deliver the final report to the client. Most link-building campaigns are delivered within 2 to 4 weeks. <br />●    Customer support: when a customer has questions or feedback, you are the first point of contact. If they require any revisions, you’ll communicate this back to the team. <br /><br />Who is Our Ideal Candidate?<br /><br />●    You have strong communication skills. You’ll need this as you’re the point of contact for both our customers and our team. You’re someone who enjoys communicating with your social contacts on a daily basis. As you’ll be emailing often, having English as your first language is preferred.<br />●    You have a basic level of knowledge of the fundamentals of SEO. Do you know the difference between different types of anchor texts? And can you talk about off-site optimisation or Domain Authority? If so, we’d love to talk further with you. <br />●    You’re a planning expert. You’re always on top of your schedule and you love to finish tasks on-time. You don’t just have a good overview of your own agenda, you can also keep an overview of a team of people.<br />●    You’re a perfectionist. At Invalley.com, we’re known for our attention to detail - this can be seen in everything we do. You’re the type of person that notices when a piece of content uses 3 different types of fonts or doesn’t contain any capital letters and changes it.<br />●    You’re familiar with using applications like Google Drive, Gmail, Google Sheets and Google Docs. You have good technical skills and can quickly adapt to new tools such as Monday.com.<br />●    You are a trustworthy, assertive and responsible person with a strong work ethic and a passion for great customer service.<br /><br />What Do We Offer?<br /><br />●    An awesome opportunity to work from anywhere in the world!<br />●    A fully flexible schedule - you can work whenever you choose to.<br />●    A position in which you have high responsibilities and plenty of opportunities for professional growth.<br />●    On-the-job training. We will first teach you how to handle the Quality Checks and Report Delivery tasks, which will take approximately 10 hours per week. <br />●    If all goes well, you’ll start working on all 5 management tasks and gradually transition into a full-time role (40 hours per week).<br />●    Weekly payments through PayPal",

    "content": "At Flock we’re having our very own ‘rocketship’ moment, growing faster than we ever imagined. We’re now looking for an experienced, results-driven Growth Marketer to head up our performance marketing efforts.<br /><br />Over the last two years we’ve reinvented insurance from the ground up. And it’s working. Since launching Flock Cover (our pay-as-you-fly drone insurance app) we have on-boarded over 2,000 active users, maintaining exponential growth and delighting our customers in the process. We have embraced experimentation and tested exciting marketing initiatives, growing through a combination of partnerships, word-of-mouth, and online buzz. Now it’s time to take this up a notch. And that’s where you come in...<br /><br />You will be overseeing our paid and unpaid marketing activities, both online and offline.<br /><br />You’ll find and test new channels with a laser focus on our CPA, identifying and re-doubling efforts on whatever works. What would the CPA for Flock be of sponsoring drone conferences? Giving away free flights? Or flying marketing-drones over London? You’ll get to test your assumptions, both working alone, with the entire Flock team, or with our existing multinational partners, to identify and carve out a successful marketing strategy.<br /><br />Key Responsibilities<br /><br />Supercharge the growth of Flock’s user base, focusing on core metrics (such as the number of policies we sell per day).<br />Analyse our reams of existing data to produce genuinely impactful insights.<br />Engage with our customers to understand the areas that we need to improve on.<br />Work with Flock’s data team to identify new usage-based KPIs.<br />Experiment with different marketing channels (online and offline) to discover what strategies work best in our industry.<br />Set up and run highly effective campaigns across all the channels we work with (and others that we might have missed).<br />Generate new marketing and growth ideas, and engage the rest of the team to implement them.<br />Collaborate with our product and tech teams, to identify and spec out new product features that will help Flock grow faster and retain users more reliably.<br />Your first 30 days<br /><br />We imagine your first month will look something like this:<br /><br />Comprehensive onboarding to the industry, our customers and our product with the help of the whole Flock team<br />Map out Flock’s existing marketing and growth efforts, and resulting attribution<br />Deep-dive into Flock’s acquisition funnel, identifying missed opportunities and easy wins<br />Develop and execute on five growth experiments with the support of our product and marketing teams<br /><br />You should apply if some (or all) of the following are true:<br /><br />You’ve got demonstrable experience exponentially growing the user base and sales of a new product.<br />You are data-driven, always looking to understand the numbers behind everything you do.<br />You enjoy working in teams, but can also work well on your own, and you’re happy to get your hands dirty.<br />You are an excellent communicator, and enjoy the challenge of making the complex seem simple.<br />You’re more than able to multitask and adapt quickly to new situations.<br />You’re happy to take ownership of a task from end to end.<br />You have experience across a range of online and offline platforms (search, social, direct mail, email, etc.)<br />You have a wealth of experience using data-tracking technologies.<br />You have set-up and run successful digital ad campaigns.<br /><br />Our Process<br /><br />Apply on this page. Please explain (briefly) why you’re interested in this position and why you believe you’re the right person for this job, providing examples of your past achievements (if possible).<br />We will schedule you in for an initial 10-minute phone conversation with Antton (Product Lead and founder).<br />We will send over a short exercise for you to complete. This will test a range of skills, from technical to creative. No right or wrong answers here; we’re more interested in understanding your approach.<br />You will be invited for an engaging on-site interview where you will present your exercise answers to various members of the team, including Antton, and Ed (CEO).<br />Meet the entire team in a very casual setting for a friendly chat!<br /><br />Benefits <br /><br />Remuneration<br /><br />Competitive salary<br />Options: we want you to own the work that you do. And this means owning the company you work in. All employees receive options as part of their compensation package.<br />Pension: we offer a full auto-enrollment workplace pension for all employees who want it. Nothing fancy here. Just a pension.<br /><br />Work-life balance<br /><br />Large amounts of autonomy and empowerment in your work<br />Holidays: we offer 33 days of holiday per annum, including bank holidays.<br />Flexible working / working from home: we don’t have fixed working hours, some of our team start at 8am, others at 10am. We trust you to establish an effective working pattern that allows you to excel in your role and makes you a great Flock team member.<br /><br />Learning & Development<br /><br />Books, courses and conference budgets for all employees<br />Hackathons: we run a quarterly hackathon which lasts 24 hours. Everyone’s invited to join in.<br />Breakfast club: learn from your colleagues (or teach us something new!)<br /><br />Perks<br /><br />Friday fancy lunches: every Friday the entire Flock teams heads for lunch together. We call it ‘fancy lunch’. But sometimes it’s just at a pub.<br />Quarterly offsite adventures: every quarter the entire team do something crazy together. Like fly a plane to the coast. Unlimited coffee, tea and fresh fruit every day",

Through relentless customer development we’ve identified an enormous market opportunity for Content Operations (ContentOps).<br><br>ContentOps addresses the gap that exists between content strategy and publishing platforms/traditional CMS'.

You must be happy to take critique, self-improve and move forward.<br>* An iterative approach - We focus on learning and improving our processes as we go.<br>* Customer focus - You should always be thinking, “What can I be doing to deliver value to our customers?”<br>* Leave your ego at the door.
