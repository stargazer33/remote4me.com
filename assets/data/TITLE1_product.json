So, you are going to be responsible for defining the UX (more fun for you) with some input from my side.</p><p>So, if you can do some of those task mentioned above, send me an email to brodanoel@gmail.comPlease, the email should contain:* Your portfolio or any kind of work that you already worked on (please, don’t bother you sending a PERFECT portfolio. Just send something)* How much time have you taken creating each of your portfolio projects? (Will be helpful to get some cost estimations)* Your rate (USD per hour) (consider that I’m not a company. It’s just a couple of side projects)</p><p>Important: I’m not in a hurry with none of the coming project. I WILL NOT request things to be done “yesterday”. We’ll have time.

Yet it remains out of reach for many. MyTutor&rsquo;s mission is to bring life-changing tuition to all. Our handpicked network of tutors work online with pupils from all walks of life, and we&rsquo;ve given half a million lessons so far &ndash; raising results on average by one whole grade.

No travelling for Mum and Dad, no waiting around, no strangers in your home. Pupils can have their lessons anywhere &ndash; at Grandma&rsquo;s, at a friend&rsquo;s house or on holiday, so there&rsquo;s no disruption in the run-up to exams.</p><br /><p>Tuition is now more affordable and accessible, making life less stressful for those who care about seeing the next generation succeed.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>About the role</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be joining our passionate, ambitious team in an exciting, fast-paced &amp; high-growth environment.

Now it has been defined as a platform that has the potential to reinvent the rental living experience, and we want you to join us as we continue our expansion in the Irish and UK market. <br /><br />So what actually is PRELO? PRELO is a tech company that connects a globally mobile community of renters to their perfect home. We help home-hunters search, secure and move in to their perfect home - all they need to do is the unpacking! <br /><br />However, PRELO is about much more than just putting a roof overhead. At PRELO we are passionate about building inspired and connected communities. This really helps our members foster relationships and build a strong support network, not just with your housemates or neighbours, but people from all corners of their city. <br /><br /><strong>PURPOSE OF THE ROLE </strong><br />We are currently seeking candidates who would be interested in a flexible paid internship with specific focus and interest within Business Operations. <br />The Community Manager responsibilities are: <br /><br />-Research suitable apartments/rental homes that meet the home-hunters individual and unique needs. <br />-Collaborating with property agencies and landlords regarding property viewings and tenancy agreements. -Facilitate &lsquo;individual mover&rsquo; home-hunters to source potential housemates via PRELO &lsquo;Buddy-Up&rsquo; process. -You will help the CEO manage client accounts as the main point of contact and ensure that our work is aligned with their business goals. <br />-Leverage customer feedback to drive improvements to the products and services that we provide customers. <br />-Full exposure to other departments within the company including Sales, Marketing and Product Development. <br />-Strong potential for full time and senior position as we are growing aggressively. <br />-You will work directly with the CEO getting exposure in all areas of a start-up business. <br /><br />This is not an ordinary role in an ordinary company. This is full-on start-up mode where you will have the ability and freedom to make decisions in a split second without the need for approval after approval from management. We are extremely ambitious and plan to make ourselves a global brand which will provide you with the opportunity to see the world and grow both personally and professionally. What are you waiting for, take the leap! <br /><br /><strong>Underlying Principles when working with PRELO:&nbsp;</strong><br />-Accountability - Are you happy to stand over the work you are doing? <br />-Provide Value- Provide more value to your colleagues and customers than you ask for <br />-Communication - transparency with your colleagues and customers. <br />-Respect - respect to your colleagues and customers. <br />-PRELO is about People, not Properties <br /><br /><strong>Skills: </strong><br />Empathy - can you put yourself in the shoes of the home-hunter to understand the stresses and strains of the relocation process? <br /><br />Proactive &ndash; can you proactively engage with the expat, landlords, property agents and our partners to continue to streamline our service offering? <br /><br />Time Management &ndash; we are in a very fast-moving environment, can you balance demands from a large number of home-hunters at any one time? <br /><br /><strong>Additional Info: </strong><br />-Paid Internship + bonuses + work from home <br />-Will range from 10-20 hours per week, but happy to work out a schedule that fits candidate <br />-Suitable for undergraduates or postgraduates who are interested in part time work with view to full time role in the summer months. <br />-Suitable for someone who wants to work within operations but also get exposure to sales and marketing. -Suitable for someone with an entrepreneurial mindset who wants to start their own business and willing to be &lsquo;scrappy&rsquo; and get stuck in to all areas of the business. <br /><br />*Remote/Part Time/Contract Roles are available for this role* <br /><br />For more info contact tommy@prelo.io or visit www.prelo.io</p>",

This could be the position and team that you've been looking for.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Your Opportunity: </strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li>Pick and choose products and selling strategies to ensure maximum profitability.

You're always looking to optimize, automate, or find new ways to apply leverage in your life - especially with the use of technology.</p><p>• <strong>Curious but Careful</strong>: You are investigative by nature. You're curious about how things work and like &quot;looking under the hood&quot; and inspecting things. You do this to gain understanding, allowing you to make better decisions and manage risk.</p><p>• <strong>Competitive:</strong> You are a competitor, even if it's just with yourself. You are creative and enjoy gamifying <em>(Yes, this is a word!)</em> work and every-day challenges just for the heck of it. You hate losing but understand that with each loss comes a lesson.</p><p>• <strong>Positive attitude</strong>: You have a can-do spirit, are fun to be around, don't complain, make excuses, or gossip. You are open-minded and adaptable because we constantly push each other to improve and become better. You possess high integrity, the capacity to learn quickly, and high intrinsic motivation. We can teach you the rest.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What you need:</strong></p><ul><li>At least <strong>2 years in sales &amp; marketing and (or) merchandising</strong></li><li>At least <strong>2 years of experience in online marketing activities</strong>: E-commerce, affiliate, high- performance agency (or in-house) work.</li><li>Proficient in Adobe Photoshop, HTML, Excell</li><li>Experience with product research and forecasting sales velocity and profitability</li><li>Passion for learning about marketing, sales, and building a winning team.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Will be valued:</strong></p><ul><li>Experienced working in the online retail industry or retail industry</li><li>Experienced working/playing in a team setting, ex: football, soccer, professional e-sport</li><li>Experienced with utilizing software like Seller Cloud, Price Guard, Informed, AppEagle</li><li>Knowledge of gardening is a plus</li><li>You read books or listen to audiobooks</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Benefits of joining our team:</strong></p><ul><li>You can live and work wherever you want</li><li>We love investing in knowledge and seeing our team members grow.

Our mission is to make them more open and fair, driving new economic opportunities and putting people in control of their digital lives.</p><p>To start we've built the <a href='https://www.argent.xyz/' rel='nofollow'>first crypto wallet</a> with the simplicity and security of the best new bank apps - yet we never hold users’ assets. It takes the complexity out of Ethereum and is driven by our dedication to user experience.</p><p>We launched in 2018 and have a world-class team with experience scaling mobile apps to tens of millions of users. Our eclectic backgrounds include PhDs in nuclear physics and quantum cryptography. We’re fortunate to be backed by the top VCs in Europe, including <a href='https://www.indexventures.com/' rel='nofollow'>Index Ventures</a>, <a href='https://www.creandum.com/' rel='nofollow'>Creandum</a> and <a href='https://www.firstminute.capital/' rel='nofollow'>firstminute capital</a>. </p><h4> Senior Growth Marketer </h4><p>This is a pivotal role for Argent. You'll be the first person in the team dedicated to helping us achieve our ambitious growth plans. To do this you'll own all of our marketing initiatives, from idea to execution, analysis and iteration.</p><p>The strength of our product provides an outstanding foundation for you to build upon, especially for word of mouth and other organic campaigns. We've got an enthusiastic community emerging and you'll expand it further, both online and offline.</p><p>The campaigns you lead will help define our brand to a global audience. While there's a lot of room for us to grow among today's crypto users, we're particularly excited by the opportunity to bring crypto to a totally new, much wider audience.</p><p>Maximising our growth with these audiences will require creativity and rigorous analytics. Your originality, love of experimentation and adaptation will help us discover which channels are most successful and how we can best use them.</p><p>Your understanding of our customers and target market will inform our product development. This means you'll work closely with our CEO and product team.</p><h4> Requirements </h4><ul><li>Minimum 4 years in growth or marketing at a high performance tech company or leading marketing agency</li><li>Experience owning every stage of the marketing funnel across multiple channels</li><li>Impact focused with the analytical skills and experience to assess initiatives</li><li>Strong storytelling and creativity</li><li>Happy working autonomously</li><li>No crypto experience necessary, but the successful candidate will be excited by the opportunity to shape the next era of the web and of open finance</li><li>Fluent in written and spoken English</li></ul><h4> How we work </h4><p>We work remotely, transparently and balance Argent with the rest of our lives. We’ve all got loved ones with unpredictable schedules, be they kids or cats.</p><p>Although we’re a distributed team you'll need to be based in the UK or Europe. This is because we find communication much easier when we’re in similar time zones and a short flight away. Within Europe you can choose to work wherever you like!</p><p>We get together for a week every quarter so we can collaborate in person, explore new solutions, and have fun. So far we’ve been to Nice, Toulouse, Brussels, Lisbon and Barcelona.</p><h4> Equal opportunities </h4><p>At the heart of what we do is making crypto accessible to everyone. We want the team itself to reflect that diversity so we’d strongly encourage applications from underrepresented demographics.</p>",

We make it easier for people to share their creative works, whether academic, artistic, educational or other, as well as to access and build upon the works of others. By helping people and organizations share knowledge and creativity, we aim to build a more equitable, accessible, and innovative world. \\n\\nTo accomplish our goals, CC has created a global network of experts (the CC Global Network, or “CCGN”) consisting of members, advocates, and other supporters who share our values and goals, and with whom we collaborate in national and international fora in close collaboration with like-minded sister organizations. CC and the CCGN seek to increase and scale our impact and effectiveness globally, finding ways to create value for network members and society by promoting collaboration, mentorship, networking, and meaningful change. Fueling, supporting, motivating, and listening to the CCGN is paramount to scaling CC’s mission; this position is central to accomplishing these critical, shared goals. \\n\\nCreative Commons is looking for a Network Manager passionate about working with a global open community, open culture, open licensing, and the public domain. The Network Manager will report to the Director of Ecosystem Strategy and will work closely with the CCGN, the Open Policy Manager, and cross-organizationally, including with the CC Open Education, Communications, Legal, and GLAM teams.\\n\\nThis position will support and scale the Creative Commons Global Network.

Then come join our team! We are looking for team-oriented, resourceful and self-motivated candidates.</p><p><strong>Job Purpose: Content Manager</strong></p><p>Shield GEO provides outsourced employment and payroll for hundreds of employees in over 60 countries. Our Marketing team is responsible for bringing leads to the sales team. We maintain, update and work on the website and create content for both existing and prospective clients. As part of the team, you’ll be involved in producing content like our A Day in the Life Series, which features stories about our employees; our annual Gender Diversity series and our collection of thought pieces by our journalist on Flexible and Remote working.</p><p>Our team collaborates closely with colleagues in Customer Success to ensure that the content delivered aligns closely with the needs of prospective clients.</p><p>This role would suit a highly creative individual. You’ll also have autonomy over your own projects and be able to clearly see the results of your work.</p><p>You will have the opportunity to work remotely and with flexible hours. You’ll also have the opportunity to advance your career in a young, growing company.</p><p><strong>Working with Shield</strong></p><p>If you are excited by the thought of playing an active role in a company that provides opportunities to create and innovate, you’re at the right place.</p><p>We’re a remote-friendly company with employees all around the world. We don’t want to be limited by location and are open to hiring anyone from anywhere as long as it’s a great fit for us both. Before we get to know you, you might like to get an idea of who we are so you can decide if you want to be a part of what we’re about.</p><p>Every person is unique. At Shield GEO, we encourage an inclusive culture that embraces each individual’s differences. We believe that diversity of thought and experience is vital to generating creative ideas, developing effective strategies and making better decisions.</p><p>When hiring we do not discriminate by any unlawful means including, but not limited to, race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, age or veteran status.</p><p>We offer reasonable accommodations for people with disabilities wherever possible. Our employees are provided with the basic equipment required to give them a comfortable, safe and productive workplace. If you require additional equipment beyond our standard offering we are happy to work with you to try to find a solution.</p><p>We can’t quite show you what it’s like to work with us but you can hear from our employees themselves.</p><ul><li>Working remotely and flexibly with Shield Geo</li><li>Leave policy</li><li>Work equipment policy</li><li>Workplace Diversity policy</li></ul><p><strong>Do you share our values?</strong></p><p>Our 4 values are integral to who we are. Our company culture is constantly evolving, every person who joins us adds something unique to our culture. But our values are shared by all Shield GEO employees. Do these values resonate with you?</p><p><strong>Grow</strong></p><p>We believe that personal growth and company growth go hand in hand. We look to foster our own growth and help grow the company. Every day is an opportunity to face a new challenge and get a little better. In our world of international employment it is impossible to know all the answers. Instead of trying to know everything, we focus on knowing how to solve problems. When mistakes happen we know it’s all part of the learning curve and we seek feedback to help us improve. We keep an eye on the big picture so we can identify improvements to processes and systems. As the problems become larger and more complex, it means that we’ll need more flexible and agile minds to come up with solutions.</p><p><strong>Own It</strong></p><p>We are self-motivated and love to see tasks to completion. Our managers and team mates are often in different time zones, and that’s ok! We aren’t afraid to step up when things get a little tough. We don’t like to micro-manage or&nbsp;be&nbsp;micromanaged. We trust our team mates to carry out their part of the process. We are responsible for our own workload and making sure we get our most important things done each day. If we get stuck we proactively seek help. And we show our reliability and accountability by keeping our systems updated. This also means our results can speak for themselves.</p><p><strong>Do The Right Thing</strong></p><p>Our clients trust us with compliance on their most important asset – their employees. This is a big responsibility! Doing the right thing means often times we choose a harder path and see it through to the end. It means we are open with our colleagues, clients and suppliers about bad news just the same as we share good news. And sometimes doing the right thing means we have to make decisions that will upset the very person we are trying to help. It’s a high standard but we stand by this very strongly. Doing the right thing also means considering how our actions impact those around us.</p><p><strong>Be Human</strong></p><p>We are a service business and helping people is at the core of everything we do. We pride ourselves on how we interact with colleagues, service providers and clients. We recognize that in all areas we’re dealing with real humans.</p><p>We know that working remotely and dealing with such a mix of people around the world is challenging. We know that if we are having trouble understanding someone, they are also struggling to understand us. Empathy is fundamental to helping us discover what people mean and how they are feeling. To avoid misinterpretation we assume best intent in others.<br>Because so much of our communication is written and asynchronous, we default to&nbsp;<em>over-communication</em>. This means we give extra details because we don’t leave people guessing. We make sure our words are clear and easy to understand. And we are kind to our fellow humans.</p><p><strong>Your Background</strong></p><ul><li>Relevant degree OR any degree with some relevant work experience OR a few years relevant experience</li><li>Comfortable with technology. We are mostly remote and that means we rely on a bunch of applications to keep connected. That means video conferences and voice calls (Zoom), chat and messaging (Slack, Skype and Salesforce Chatter), shared documents (Dropbox). You’ll likely be working by yourself during parts of your day without access to tech support.</li><li>Experience with any of the following – WordPress, Mailchimp, Canva, Google Analytics, Salesforce, Fullstory is helpful but not essential.</li></ul><p><strong>Essential Characteristics of this role</strong></p><ul><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills and the ability to absorb information quickly.</li><li>Able to prioritize effectively and work autonomously while coordinating with an international team.</li><li>Exceptional attention to detail</li><li>Well organised and able to manage multiple deadlines</li><li>Ideally located in Singapore, Hong Kong, Philippines or Australia</li><li>Some flexibility in working hours. We discourage overtime work and you will only be expected to work a standard number of hours each week. But we have clients and colleagues all over the world so on some rare occasions you might need to be on calls in the morning or evening.</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><p>As content manager, you’ll be working on multiple web properties.</p><p>Manage Website</p><ul><li>Maintain website and update pages regularly</li><li>Proof read and publish articles</li><li>Identify key pages based on website traffic and propose changes to maximise conversions</li><li>Manage and commission redesign of pages</li></ul><p>Content Creation</p><ul><li>Create article briefs for our writers</li><li>Liaise with our illustrator and journalist and manage the creation our monthly newsletters (2 per month)</li><li>Commissioning designs for content</li></ul><p>Social Media</p><ul><li>Manage our LinkedIn and Twitter page</li><li>Schedule Twitter and LinkedIn posts weekly</li><li>Interact and engage with key influencers in the global employment/remote spaces on Twitter</li></ul><p>Reporting</p><ul><li>Monthly Marketing Report Keyword Rankings, Analysis of Website Traffic based on findings from Google Analytics, Track Clicks and Likes on Newsletters, Social Media etc.</li><li>Create weekly meeting agendas for Marketing</li></ul><p><strong>Projects</strong><br>At Shield GEO, you will have plenty of opportunities to lead and manage projects from time to time on top of your daily tasks. Every one at Shield gets involved in these projects. At the moment, you will be working on the redevelopment of one of our web properties.

    "content": "<h3>School Space - Why</h3><br /><p>Like it or not, funding plays a critical role in a schools ability to deliver a great education, and we are unfortunately facing a funding cut crisis in the UK, the scale of which hasn&rsquo;t been seen since WWII. This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>This is where School Space comes in.&nbsp;</p><br /><h3>School Space - How</h3><br /><p>Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays. We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the center of a thriving community.</p><br /><h3>School Space - Team</h3><br /><p>Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 8 years, and recent success includes investment raises, 45 partner schools, and over a million generated for them. We&rsquo;ve been on the Techstars 2018 Cohort, been nominated for Social Enterprise UK&rsquo;s Social Enterprise of the Year,&nbsp; and picked up a few awards and amazing networks along the way. Our team are committed to the nth degree and full of the belief that social business is the model of the future. We have endless determination to see School Space grow fast and well, scaling our impact across the UK and beyond.</p><br /><h3>The Role - Why</h3><br /><p>Our operation covers 45 schools (and growing), 90+ incredible part-time Community Connectors (the amazing people who open and close our schools) and thousands of events annually.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>The Community Manager is responsible for leading, training and inspiring a group of our Community Connectors. You will have administrative support, but will lead the direction and engagement strategy to ensure our team are empowered with the tools to do their job.</p><br /><h3>The Role - How</h3><br /><p>Key responsibilities include:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Line Management - whilst most of our remote team work between 5-15 hours per week, they need a point of contact, and you must master supporting them individually whilst drawing on others in your team to balance this responsibility.</li><br /><li>Developing and Leading an engagement strategy - our Community Connectors (CCs) already engage via weekly videos from the co-founders and use slack to communicate, but we want you to revamp their &lsquo;journey&rsquo; as a School Space team member, developing the touchpoints they should have to feel supported throughout their lifetime with us.</li><br /><li>Developing a training programme - you would be responsible for starting the &lsquo;School Space Academy&rsquo;, which will involve training new starters and providing refreshers for existing staff members.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>What we want from you:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience in leading communities, or managing large groups of people to success.</li><br /><li>A track record of developing a strategy yourself and seeing it through.</li><br /><li>Empathy and excellent people skills - an ability to manage but also inspire via &lsquo;low touch&rsquo; methods including innovative techniques.</li><br /><li>The ability to self-start and self manage, to bring your own ideas to the table and manage them from start to finish.</li><br /><li>Excellent time management and prioritisation skills.</li><br /><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills, comfortable with using basic tech tools such as slack.</li><br /><li>The ability and desire to work in a fast-paced, challenging environment with peers who challenge you to constantly improve.</li><br /><li>An eagerness to take on more responsibility, and you thrive on change - we are a start up and that means things are fast moving.</li><br /><li>Comfort in working evenings and weekends, as training will have to be done in these hours (expectation; minimum one weekend a month, taken in lieu)</li><br /></ul>",

An equal equity split is available for the right candidate who is prepared to share the capital investment. Otherwise equity will be adjusted to reflect risk.

    "content": "<p><strong>About Us</strong></p><br /><p>Planes is a young digital product studio, started by two friends who liked making great products together. As we grow that will always be our essence - to work on products we believe in with people we enjoy every day.</p><br /><p>Our background is in startups, not agencies. We prefer shipping code, listening to users and iterating quickly rather than long lunches, &lsquo;expert&rsquo; reports and death by powerpoint. This approach has lead us to work with all sorts of people, from international fin-tech providers to startups, building products that their users love.</p><br /><p>A small and nimble team, we work collaboratively to produce work that we are proud of and our clients love. We are made up of designers, engineers and product lovers who are all entrepreneurs by nature.</p><br /><p><strong>The Role</strong></p><br /><p>We are looking for a Junior Product Manager to join our team full time. You will be responsible for managing a number of products at once, both new projects and retainers for existing products. Working in a multi-disciplinary team you will be the voice of the user, while also keeping sprints running on time and budget. Days will be varied and could involve any of the following:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Running user interviews to uncover insights</li><br /><li>Testing prototypes with users to understand usability and solution fit</li><br /><li>Digging into data to inform decisions and query hypothesis</li><br /><li>Collaborating with a designer to convert ideas into a tangible product</li><br /><li>Writing user stories and managing development pipelines to ensure delivery stays on track</li><br /><li>Running product demos and sprint planning sessions with clients and the development team</li><br /><li>Researching and making recommendations for solutions to product problems, or to help with product goals</li><br /><li>Wireframing and mapping out user journeys</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>About you</strong></p><br /><p>For this role, you will have the right combination of experience and skills to manage multiple projects and priorities. You will need to be able to take the initiative and be organised as the rest of the team will rely on you to keep workflows moving in the right direction. Tonnes of experience is not required, but here is some idea of the kinds of experience that would suit:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Client facing; communicating directly with clients both written and in person</li><br /><li>UX research/design; an appreciation of how users interact with products, how to map and measure these journeys and the ability to improve them. You might have some experience with wireframing too.</li><br /><li>Project planning; aptitude at managing many moving parts and conflicting stakeholders requirements</li><br /><li>Specification writing; translating designs or requirements to user stories for developers to build</li><br /><li>Scrum/agile exposure; you will have exposure to the principles of agile development, and know how to adapt a development framework to suit various types of projects.</li><br /><li>Exposure to deliverying digital projects; this doesn't have to be apps it could be micro sites or campaigns for an agency too for example</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Working at Planes</strong></p><br /><p>We are a relatively relaxed bunch, and believe that if we hire adults and treat them like them we won't need any baby sitters. As such we leave it to you to decide where and when you will do your best work. If you need to stay at home and nut out a tough problem so be it, if you have to come in late because you are dancing at Morning Glory -power too you! That being said, we all tend to spend most of our time in the studio because we have more fun working together, so this is not a fully remote role.</p><br /><p>We are also a social bunch and since we work with people we like we tend to hang out after work too. We don't really plan anything but tend to find ourselves doing at least one activity together a month be it mountain biking, rock climbing or just going out for beers. We also get that you have your own life too, so won't be upset if you can't join us every Friday night.</p><br /><p>Holidays are the spice of life, so on top of your 28 days a year, we also let you take up to a month of leave without pay if you like to do even more adventuring.</p><br /><p><strong>Hiring process</strong></p><br /><p>If this sounds like a piece of you, please send through a short (no longer than one paragraph) intro on you along with your CV. If we like what we see we will start with a phone call. Following that we will send you across a small challenge for you to work on and come in to present back to us, at the same time we will introduce you to the team, show you our office and have a chat over a coffee.</p>",

Communicating to the world is at the heart of delivering that.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a growing startup so we&rsquo;re looking for a well rounded Marketing graduate capable of growing with us from the ground up.</p><br /><h2>About Desana</h2><br /><p>Desana gives our customers access to a network of great work space when they want it, where they want it, through a single monthly subscription. We do that by supporting coworking spaces, taking their spare inventory and giving our customers fluid access to it.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a growing startup based between London, Edinburgh, and Stockholm but we aim to become a globally relevant company by disrupting the way people think about, and access, the places they work.

We pride ourselves in radical open-ness and strive to create a company that fulfils its users, partners, and employees.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2>The Role</h2><br /><p>Marketing done well isn&rsquo;t always marketing done by the book.

We want to build a brand that&rsquo;s memorable and impactful to both our customers and the workspaces that we&rsquo;re partnered with. To do that, we need someone that&rsquo;s motivated to:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Work with the founders and get to know the business really well.</li><br /><li>Work with our consumer groups, and workspace partners and will learn how to speak with them directly through email and LinkedIn, and indirectly through our social media channels.</li><br /><li>Work as a member of the team to produce a marketing strategy plan - you&rsquo;ll be in charge of delivering it.</li><br /><li>Work together to generate creative ideas and to identify new, high impact ways (and channels) to grow the business and engage potential customers.</li><br /><li>Run our social media platforms.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Work with photographers and videographers to create high-quality, engaging media.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Create and manage a content calendar for analytically focussed, multi-channel marketing campaigns.</li><br /><li>Reach out directly to potential customers and create a pipeline for the team to meet with them.</li><br /><li>Participate daily in a 10 minute whole team &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; call, wherever you are. Our team are regularly in London so it will be up to you to touch-base with us and take charge of your days.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>About You</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>You have a solid understanding of marketing: you have a relevant degree and, ideally, can already demonstrate experience in delivering marketing campaigns.</li><br /><li>You know what&rsquo;s effective: you have experience with marketing automation platforms, CDPs, and attribution tools and it would be advantageous if you are able to make good recommendations on different platforms.</li><br /><li>You get the importance of data: you understand growth metrics, A/B testing, and statistics and you&rsquo;ve delivered effective data-driven strategies and marketing campaigns across multiple media channels for for the companies you&rsquo;ve worked with.</li><br /><li>You can design: not essential for the role but it would be extremely advantageous if you have design experience that can be applied directly to content creation.</li><br /><li>You have CRM experience / awareness: not essential but would be really useful.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re personable: a fun, enthusiastic people-person.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re self-starting &amp; self-motivated: you&rsquo;re confident in your abilities, willing to take on responsibilities, and manage your own agendas and work scopes. Actively seek and respond to feedback.</li><br /><li>You can communicate diligently: you&rsquo;re able to understand the importance of maintaining regular communication with our team, our partners, affiliates, and our customers. You have excellent written and verbal communication skills in English.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re never complacent: you strive to recognise that things can always be better than they currently are and have the confidence to present solutions to any weaknesses or inefficiencies that you see.</li><br /><li>You have a growth mindset: a desire to grow both personally and professionally.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Desana benefits</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Share options in the business if the role were to become full time.</li><br /><li>Flexible and remote work hours with a strong focus on work-life balance.</li><br /><li>We&rsquo;re establishing complete salary transparency across the company with clear progression paths.</li><br /><li>Team drinks, events and trips.</li><br /><li>Free access to the app and our network of workspaces.</li><br /></ul>",

Adventure awaits!&nbsp;</p><br /><h2>Description</h2><br /><p>We want to give people the freedom to access the world&rsquo;s best work spaces, anywhere, any time, at the touch of a button.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>One of the most fundamental aspects of our business is how well we understand the needs and intricacies of the work spaces we partner with. Your role will be to build and maintain great relationships with a network of the UKs best coworking and flexible workspaces.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re looking for an energetic and passionate person to help us grow the number of great places our customers access through the Desana app so that they have the best experience possible.</p><br /><h2>Desana</h2><br /><p>We&rsquo;re a growing startup based between London, Edinburgh, and Stockholm. We aim to become a globally relevant company by disrupting the way people think about, and access, the places they work. We're looking for the best people to join us on our journey.</p><br /><p>With prior experience in startups ourselves, we&rsquo;re keen to do things the right way from the very start. That&rsquo;s why we believe in openness and transparency in everything we do, from salary to communications, to processes.</p><br /><h2>Why Join Us</h2><br /><p>We&rsquo;re at the forefront of the new wave of innovation in a sector that&rsquo;s already undergoing tremendous change and significant growth. Join us to not only grow the network of workspaces that are already changing the ways people work, but by living and breathing that transformation as you work flexibly, autonomously, and (as much as the job demands) remotely yourself. We pride ourselves in radical open-ness and are creating&nbsp; a company that fulfils its users, partners, and employees.</p><br /><h2>The Role</h2><br /><h2><em>Growing the Network</em></h2><br /><p>We want to build a network that&rsquo;s genuinely valuable to our customers and the operators that we work with. To do that, we need someone that&rsquo;s motivated to: &nbsp;</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Increase the number of workspaces on the Desana platform each month across the UK.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Collaborate in the shaping and delivery of a scalable space onboarding and retention&nbsp; strategies - regular communication with workspaces on the network; in person, LinkedIn, by phone, by email, and through events.</li><br /><li>Maintain CRM to track relationships and opportunities.</li><br /><li>Create and deliver result orientated &ldquo;sprints&rdquo; (tasks) based on the company&rsquo;s 6 and 12 month goals.&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><h2><em>Communication</em></h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Working directly with team to incessantly improve brand and workspace onboarding experience / interaction.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Regular monitoring and updating of our task management system.</li><br /><li>Prepare weekly, monthly, quarterly meetings that effectively communicate data informed outcomes from onboarding strategies.</li><br /><li>Participate daily in a 10 minute whole team &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; call, wherever you are.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2><em>Industry Awareness</em></h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Consistently develop wider awareness of coworking industry trends; meticulous attention to specific triggers for workspace / operator types.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Be able to identify and respond to micro-indicators of change.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2><em>About You</em></h2><br /><ul><br /><li>You have hospitality or related experience: If you&rsquo;ve worked in the coworking / flexible workspace industry or in a workspace brokering environment that would be more advantageous but experience in hospitality would be great if not.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have experience in sales: it would be great if you can bring experience in managing operational tasks in a sales/relationship management role.</li><br /><li>You can stay cool and deliver effectively: you have the ability to work to a deadline, prioritising workloads according to different criteria.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re data-driven: you understand growth metrics, A/B testing, and statistics and will use these skills to devise effective on-boarding strategies.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>You have CRM experience / awareness: particularly Hubspot. Not essential but would be really useful.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re self-starting &amp; self-motivated: you&rsquo;re confident in your abilities, willing to take initiative, to take on your own responsibilities, and manage your own agendas and work scopes. Actively seek and respond to feedback.</li><br /><li>You can communicate diligently: you&rsquo;re able to understand the importance of maintaining regular communication with our team, our partners, and the workspace operators in our network. Excellent written and verbal communication skills in English.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re never complacent: you strive to recognise that things can always be better than they currently are and have the confidence to present solutions to any weaknesses or inefficiencies that you see.</li><br /><li>You have a growth mindset: a desire to grow both personally and professionally.</li><br /><li>You&rsquo;re resilient: you appreciate the pace and challenges of working in a startup and know when to seize the right opportunities in a such a fast-paced environment, while working to exceed the expectations of the workspace operators we partner with.</li><br /><li>You have a good network: if you have a good contact base in the UK coworking / property sector, that would be advantageous but not essential.</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>Desana Benefits</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Share options in the business.</li><br /><li>Flexible and remote work hours with a strong focus on work-life balance.</li><br /><li>We&rsquo;re establishing complete salary transparency across the company with clear progression paths.</li><br /><li>Team drinks, events, and trips.</li><br /><li>Free access to the app and our network of workspaces.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Think you&rsquo;re the right person for the role?

We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;6m in venture funding from the most respected investors in technology and real estate. Our vision is to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed. The beginning of this journey is our online platform to help businesses rent, manage and share office space in London.</p><br /><p>As a product designer at Hubble, you will have the opportunity to add your magic to every stage of the design process. Working closely with product managers and tech leads, you will have the autonomy to conjure up functional yet delightful solutions to genuine user problems. All the while working towards business goals.</p><br /><p>Your role will of course include wire-framing, prototyping and spinning up high fidelity designs and assets but this is only a small part. Through user testing and internal feedback sessions, you will be responsible for continually testing ideas and assumptions and mixing your findings back into the designs. You will be able to use these findings to explain and defend your design rationale with the wider team and stakeholders. Excellent communication skills, explaining complex solutions in simple terms and the ability to challenge people in the wider team at all levels, backed with evidence, are all crucial.</p><br /><p>Strong visual UI design is a given, but beyond that you will be instrumental in following and helping to build out the Hubble design system. You will work closely with our engineers and regularly pair with them to help set the rules and ingredients for new design assets and components. A keen eye for detail is important but you should understand the trade-offs between striving for pixel-perfection against good enough to ship fast.</p><br /><p>You will possess a functional but creative mind and a no-fear attitude to your work. With a scientific approach to product design, don't be afraid to fail-fast and learn. You will feel empowered to push the needle, and suggest wildcard ideas that may make some colleagues squirm, but always be grounded in the possible. We build our products in an iterative, continuous deployment style, but as a designer you should always be thinking of where we want to be rather than just what's next.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>REQUIREMENTS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years experience in designing digital products.</li><br /><li>Fully proficient in designing for various screen sizes with a mobile first approach to responsive design.</li><br /><li>Solid understanding of UX design principles.</li><br /><li>Good understanding of atomic design and front end architecture.</li><br /><li>Expertise in the tools of the trade, sketch, invision etc. UI animations desirable but not required.</li><br /><li>Have the confidence to explain and defend design decisions to colleagues at all levels.</li><br /><li>Experience in mapping out user journeys and flows.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>&nbsp;</h2><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>BENEFITS</h2><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture.

    "content": "<h1><strong>About us</strong></h1><br /><p>We are on a journey to make pet healthcare more accessible, and we want you to help us! Did you know that only 8% of health issues are seen by a veterinary professional? In real numbers: pets experience 24 issues per year, but only 2 of them make it to the vet. This isn&rsquo;t because people are bad at being pet owners &mdash; going to the vet can be expensive, and takes a lot of effort, and sometimes it&rsquo;s even embarrassing. We want to remove all these barriers that stop pet parents from seeking expert care so that our pets can live the long and healthy lives they deserve.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our mission is to empower vets to advocate for their patients wherever and whenever suits them. Our current product provides an app-based approach that allows vets to interact with their patients through a combination of chat and video consultations. The future holds lots of exciting opportunities to expand this into the go-to app for all things pet care related. Gula recently raised a pre-seed round of funding, and off the back of that, we are looking to build the beginnings of our product team, which is where you come in. With a goal like allowing pets to live healthier lives, a fantastic experience across all our user facing products is going to be key to overcoming challenges in changing the way pet owners think about how they interact with their care providers.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our customer facing products right now are in the form of iOS &amp; Android apps written in React Native, with a web-app soon to follow. We envisage most pet owners interacting with their vets through digital means via their mobile devices. To date, most UX work has been done in Sketch, but we are open to any tooling that can do the job well!</p><br /><h1><strong>Who we&rsquo;re looking for</strong></h1><br /><p>You would be the first Product Designer working at Gula, which gives you the opportunity to help architect the ways of working in the product team and put in place what we would consider to be best practices. Your primary responsibility will be to deliver fantastic user experiences across our range of user-facing products, both to pet owners and vets. Here are some projects you might work on in the next six months:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Building the base of a design system for Gula.</li><br /><li>Designing innovative ways for pet owners to communicate with their vet.</li><br /><li>Redesigning our website to speak to our target customers better.</li><br /><li>Crafting the language we use to speak to our users.</li><br /><li>Testing new propositions with our users.</li><br /><li>Building a library of assets to be used in marketing material.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>You might be perfect for this role if most of these apply to you:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have extensive experience designing for iOS and Android</li><br /><li>You have extensive experience designing for the responsive web</li><br /><li>You consider a close relationship with the engineering team mandatory for building great products</li><br /><li>You have worked in a start-up</li><br /><li>You have experience with user research</li><br /><li>You have experience with user testing</li><br /><li>You would describe yourself as an animal lover</li><br /><li>You are happy working autonomously</li><br /><li>You love learning new things</li><br /></ul><br /><h1><strong>Application process</strong></h1><br /><p>Once we have reviewed your CV and have decided that we could be a great mutual match, we&rsquo;d start with a short phone call or coffee to tell you more about what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve at Gula long-term and also to give you some more details about the role. Then if successful there would be a final stage where we&rsquo;d spend some more time talking about your design thinking, look at some problems together, and you would meet Gula&rsquo;s CEO Thom to find out more about our values and to see if you&rsquo;d fit in.</p><br /><h1><strong>The benefits</strong></h1><br /><ul><br /><li>Pay &pound;55,000-65,000</li><br /><li>Stock options</li><br /><li>Flexible hours</li><br /><li>Working from home when you want</li><br /><li>25 days holiday</li><br /><li>Pick your own hardware up to &pound;2000</li><br /><li>Training budget</li><br /><li>Central London office</li><br /></ul>",

With over 85,000 retrospectives run on our platform, we’re the trusted leader in our market, and we’ve been helping teams continuously improve since 2015.\\n\\nWe’re also a small, cross-functional team of passionate and fun people. We have an outstanding leadership team and a dedication to company culture, so you’ll always feel connected to our mission, even though you can work from anywhere. We’re lucky enough to have an awesome product, great revenue growth, high customer satisfaction, low churn, and a recent round of seed investment. Now, we need someone to help us take our product to the next level!\\n\\nThe right candidate for the Senior Product Designer position at Retrium is someone who has experience in a product-led organization, can translate complex customer problems into elegant solutions, understands best practices for user interface design, and likes to iterate based on research findings and customer feedback. If you’re a creative problem-solver and want to create a compelling experience for thousands of users, then come be a part of our growing team!\\n\\n### Benefits\\n\\nWe provide amazing benefits, and if you ask the team, they’ll tell you that the greatest benefits we offer employees are the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the company and the opportunities to “Listen. Learn. Teach”, another core value.\\n\\nOur other benefits include:\\n\\n- Competitive salary and equity in a fast-growing, funded startup\\n- Health, dental, and vision insurance coverage for you and your family\\n- Unlimited and minimum vacation policy (we encourage you to ask us about this!)\\n- Flexible, sustainable work hours\\n- Work from home or a co-working office\\n- All the equipment you need to do your job\\n- Continuing education and learning opportunities\\n- Annual company retreats\\n\\n### Additional Information\\n\\nRetrium is committed to creating a diverse environment where you can “Be Your Amazing Self”, yet another core value.

This means you’ll need to understand the business context, customers, and technical constraints and their impact on design in addition to being a great designer.

You approach each task you lead with an eagle eye toward details and anticipate every step and possible misstep in the process. It makes you incredibly happy when things fit together just right and projects and plans have been laid out down to the last detail. Secretly, there’s something you love about vetting a data set or proofreading a final document – you love catching and righting those small, but in your mind, critical points.</li><li><strong>You make things happen.</strong> You don’t get overwhelmed easily and you take personal responsibility for the success of your work whether it requires managing back-end processes, engaging with a team, or setting up others to execute effectively. You take pride in your integrity and follow-through on tasks.

Reflecting on your work and strengthening your approach based on your reflections is second nature to you.</li><li><strong>You’re a great communicator.</strong> You value precision and clarity in language. Whatever the medium, when people receive a message from you they are crystal-clear on the purpose and any requested action. They feel respected and that their time was well-spent.</li><li><strong>You know policies like the back of your hand.</strong> You understand the importance of policies and procedures, and you take time to fully internalize them. You care about being a steward of our organization’s resources and you work to ensure that we stretch the Teach For America dollar as efficiently as possible, taking advantage of all discounts and corporate partnerships. You care about the way we spend our money and adhere to policies because you understand the stakes involved when we spend money that’s been fundraised by our colleagues.</li><li><strong>You’re a logistics master. </strong>You have superior logistics skills. You think ahead about what will be needed and strategize or make adjustments accordingly.

    "content": "<h3> Humbly Confident Product Designer </h3><div><div>YNAB is growing, and so is our product design team. We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal finance apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have experience in designing great interfaces and experiences for most of those platforms. More important, you’re a designer who views your job as that of problem solver. You come to the table not only with a knack for interaction design and love of logical UI patterns, but also with a deep empathy for people. We design our software to fit our users more than our fancy, and you love nothing more than digging through (or conducting!) research that leads the way in the design process. You’ve been around the block a few times and know what it means to design a mature, evolving product.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):&nbsp;</strong></div><ul><li>You must have at least 3 years of experience working in product design <strong>at a software company.</strong> Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.</li><li>Experience in designing applications for both web and mobile (in your cover letter, please include the platforms for which you have designed and your level of experience with them).&nbsp;</li><li>We are looking for a designer who has a strong background in UX and usability but who also can design UI independently. This is a truly mixed position where you will be responsible for activities traditionally held in the “UX” and “UI” wheelhouses. And a user-testing/research wheelhouse, too. (Can you have three wheelhouses? Are they still wheelhouses? Yes, sometimes we do philosophical tangents, too.)</li></ul><div>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></h3><div>We build YNAB (or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands), the best budgeting software around. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.<br><br><br></div><div>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> Cultural Manifesto</a> has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong><br>Who you’d be working with:<br></strong><br><br></div><div><strong>Todd, </strong>our Chief Product Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—and knows that begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence <strong>and </strong>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.<br><br><br></div><div>And our product designers:<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Alan</strong> can be seen wearing many hats—and loving every second of it. He could be interviewing users one day and programming a prototype in Framer the next. He loves exploring ideas with teammates and lives for that rush when the team discovers a novel solution to a difficult problem. When he’s not busy designing, he’s probably either at Crossfit or working to improve his culinary skills... or contemplating the conflicts that occasionally arise between the two.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Andrea </strong>has spent a lengthy career knee-deep in interactive design. Today she finds great satisfaction in her dream job at YNAB where design and helping others converge—the perfect environment for empathic-driven design. After work, this compulsive doodler cherishes her time with her husband and kids. Soaking up live music, art, and setting sail on the occasional cruise are among her favorite to-dos.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Cindy </strong>sweats the small details when it comes to crafting simple, intuitive experiences. She loves having conversations with our users, and digs deep to find the root of their needs before exploring a solution. On most weekends (and some weekdays, depending on the daylight saving time), you can probably find her outdoors chasing sunrise and sunset with a camera in hand.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Dylan </strong>loves organizing design systems, obsessing over typographic details, and everything in between. Above his desk (ahem, kitchen table, it's a small apartment after all) sits an inconspicuous letterpressed card with Dieter Rams' 10 principles of good design on it. In his spare time he's probably taking photos or running—sometimes at the same time.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Emily</strong> is a design generalist, through and through. What she loves most about being a designer—besides the obvious draw of working with a team to build things people love—is how much there is to learn. Right now she's focused on honing her coding skills enough to be able to put up the occasional pull request as well as practicing the art of writing great microcopy. She enjoys reading books, cooking, biking, lifting weights, and spending time outdoors.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Kathryn</strong> loves to dig into problems and learn where things aren’t working, what people need, and how we can empower them to be even more amazing.&nbsp; And once she truly understands a problem, figuring out how to solve it is pretty fun. When she’s not at work, she can usually be found reading, conquering escape rooms, or hanging out with her family.<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></h3><div>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. In fact, we were recently recognized as <a href='https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune's #2 best small company to work for</a> in the United States! We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</div><div><strong><br>Live Where You Want<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too.&nbsp; Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</div><div><strong><br>No Crazy Hours<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</div><div><strong><br>Take Vacation (Seriously)<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our Slack channel, creatively named #office_wall</div><div><strong><br>The YNAB Meetup<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'> Costa Rica</a>, a <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and we most recently took over an entire hotel in Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</div><div><strong><br>Up Your Game<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>International is Absolutely Okay<br></strong><br><br></div><div>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</div><div><strong><br>If You’re Stateside…<br></strong><br><br></div><div>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)<br><br><br></div><div>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em><em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)<br><br><br></div><div><strong><br>Other Tidbits</strong></div><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp;</li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not <em>think</em> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.<br><br><br></div><h3>Now, back to you, our new Product Designer...</h3><div><strong>What Success Looks Like: <br></strong><br><br></div><div>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life changing financial control. No small thing, right? You’ll join our six product designers, working on both our web and mobile platforms. Throughout 2020, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB <em>effortless </em>and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience. You will also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users.<br><br><br></div><div>You’ll need to:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Understand the journey our users take, not just as they use our apps, but in the real world as they seek to take control of their financial lives.</li><li>Learn the design system, UI patterns, and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You have no problem designing a cross-platform feature for the web and mobile apps. You can clearly discern and navigate the relationship between the UI and the available data behind the scenes.&nbsp;</li><li>Solve design problems in a user-centric feedback loop. Research plays a big part in our design process so you’ll need to break down analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions. You’ll also follow up on the data gathered after the feature is released and continue to iterate and improve your designs until the data confirms success.&nbsp;</li><li>Shepherd your work from ideation to release. You will document your work for review with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders, make agreed-upon refinements, and will work with the developers on the upcoming feature.

We’re a software ecosystem that includes personal finance apps for web, iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Android phones. If you’re the one we’re looking for, you have experience in designing great interfaces and experiences for most of those platforms. More important, you’re a designer who views your job as that of problem solver. You come to the table not only with a knack for interaction design and love of logical UI patterns, but also with a deep empathy for people. We design our software to fit our users more than our fancy, and you love nothing more than digging through (or conducting!) research that leads the way in the design process. You’ve been around the block a few times and know what it means to design a mature, evolving product.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><span>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>You must have at least 3 years of experience working in product design&nbsp;</span><span>at a software company.</span><span>&nbsp;Complex or data-rich applications are a plus.</span></li><li><span>Experience in designing applications for both web and mobile (in your cover letter, please include the platforms for which you have designed and your level of experience with them).&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>We are looking for a designer who has a strong background in UX and usability but who also can design UI independently. This is a truly mixed position where you will be responsible for activities traditionally held in the “UX” and “UI” wheelhouses. And a user-testing/research wheelhouse, too. (Can you have three wheelhouses? Are they still wheelhouses? Yes, sometimes we do philosophical tangents, too.)</span></li></ul><p><span>That’s a super-brief intro of what you’ll be working on. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We think you will.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>A Bit About Us</span></h3><p><span>We build YNAB (or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands), the best budgeting software around. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a><span>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></p><p><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;<span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span>&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;</span><em>click</em><span>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.&nbsp;</span></p><h4><span>Who you’d be working with:</span></h4><p><span>Todd,&nbsp;</span><span>our Chief Product Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and the experiences they enable—and knows that begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, loves greyscale to an irrational extent, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence&nbsp;</span><span>and&nbsp;</span><span>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</span></p><p><span>And our product designers:</span></p><p><span>Alan</span><span>&nbsp;can be seen wearing many hats—and loving every second of it. He could be interviewing users one day and programming a prototype in Framer the next. He loves exploring ideas with teammates and lives for that rush when the team discovers a novel solution to a difficult problem. When he’s not busy designing, he’s probably either at Crossfit or working to improve his culinary skills… or contemplating the conflicts that occasionally arise between the two.</span></p><p><span>Andrea&nbsp;</span><span>has spent a lengthy career knee-deep in interactive design. Today she finds great satisfaction in her dream job at YNAB where design and helping others converge—the perfect environment for empathic-driven design. After work, this compulsive doodler cherishes her time with her husband and kids. Soaking up live music, art, and setting sail on the occasional cruise are among her favorite to-dos.</span></p><p><span>Cindy&nbsp;</span><span>sweats the small details when it comes to crafting simple, intuitive experiences. She loves having conversations with our users, and digs deep to find the root of their needs before exploring a solution. On most weekends (and some weekdays, depending on the daylight saving time), you can probably find her outdoors chasing sunrise and sunset with a camera in hand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Dylan&nbsp;</span><span>l</span><span>oves organizing design systems, obsessing over typographic details, and everything in between. Above his desk (ahem, kitchen table, it’s a small apartment after all) sits an inconspicuous letterpressed card with Dieter Rams’ 10 principles of good design on it. In his spare time he’s probably taking photos or running—sometimes at the same time.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Emily</span><span>&nbsp;is a design generalist, through and through. What she loves most about being a designer—besides the obvious draw of working with a team to build things people love—is how much there is to learn. Right now she’s focused on honing her coding skills enough to be able to put up the occasional pull request as well as practicing the art of writing great microcopy. She enjoys reading books, cooking, biking, lifting weights, and spending time outdoors.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Kathryn</span><span>&nbsp;loves to dig into problems and learn where things aren’t working, what people need, and how we can empower them to be even more amazing.&nbsp; And once she truly understands a problem, figuring out how to solve it is pretty fun. When she’s not at work, she can usually be found reading, conquering escape rooms, or hanging out with her family.</span></p><h3><span>How You’ll Work at YNAB</span></h3><p><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. In fact, we were recently recognized as</span>&nbsp;<a href='https://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune’s #2 best small company to work for</a><span>&nbsp;in the United States!</span>&nbsp;<span>We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></p><h5><span>Live Where You Want</span></h5><p><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too.&nbsp; Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></p><h5><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h5><p><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></p><h5><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h5><p><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;</span><em>minimum</em><span>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our Slack channel, creatively named #office_wall.</span></p><h5><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></h5><p><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;Costa Rica</a><span>, a&nbsp;</span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a><span>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and we most recently took over an entire hotel in Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></p><h5><span>Up Your Game</span></h5><p><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><h5><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></h5><p><span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</span></p><h5><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h5><p><span>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;</span><em>and your family.</em><span>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</span></p><p><span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;</span><em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)</span></p><h5><span>Other Tidbits</span></h5><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas.</span></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;</span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not&nbsp;</span><em>think</em><span>&nbsp;that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span></li></ul><p><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</span></p><h3><span>Now, back to you, our new Product Designer…</span></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>What Success Looks Like:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life changing financial control. No small thing, right? You’ll join our six product designers, working on both our web and mobile platforms. Throughout 2020, we’ll focus intensely on making YNAB&nbsp;</span><em>effortless&nbsp;</em><span>and helping new budgeters get started effectively, from their very first experience. You will also help us develop systems and processes to more efficiently deliver top-notch, dare we say life-changing, experiences to our users.</span></p><p><span>You’ll need to:&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><span>Understand the journey our users take, not just as they use our apps, but in the real world as they seek to take control of their financial lives.</span></li><li><span>Learn the design system, UI patterns, and financial logic of our apps like the back of your hand. You have no problem designing a cross-platform feature for the web and mobile apps. You can clearly discern and navigate the relationship between the UI and the available data behind the scenes.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Solve design problems in a user-centric feedback loop. Research plays a big part in our design process so you’ll need to break down analytics and user feedback to make informed design decisions. You’ll also follow up on the data gathered after the feature is released and continue to iterate and improve your designs until the data confirms success.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Shepherd your work from ideation to release. You will document your work for review with fellow designers, developers, and stakeholders, make agreed-upon refinements, and will work with the developers on the upcoming feature. Design reviews during the development process examine form and function and you will see the feature through to the end.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable iterating with low-fidelity designs and prototypes while working in cross-functional teams made up of developers, marketers, and customer-facing team members (waterfalls are for rivers!), while continuing to pursue a meticulous and thorough design.</span></li><li><span>Communicate and document the styling, user flows, and the impact of your designs on other parts of the system. You’ll update this documentation as feedback comes in and the apps evolve. On the flip side, you’ll provide feedback in design reviews that is clear and helpful in moving our products forward.</span></li><li><span>Communicate, explain, persuade, explore and otherwise get all the things done&nbsp;</span><em>in writing.&nbsp;</em><span>Yes, we like talking to each other, but as a remote team, much of our collaboration is asynchronous and written.</span></li><li><span>Be comfortable writing a first pass at UI copy which is then refined with the help of your team in design reviews. There’s no lorem ipsum here.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>You are comfortable speaking the language of software development. If you’re also comfortable diving into HTML and CSS (or even one of the programming languages in our development stack!) to help implement your design work, that’s a plus, but it’s not a requirement.</span></li><li><span>We use Figma for the vast majority of design work and maintaining our design system. You will aid in the expansion and maintenance of the design system and feel comfortable contributing new UI for our applications and website.

We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;6m in venture funding from the most respected investors in technology and real estate. Our vision is to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed. The beginning of this journey is our online platform to help businesses rent, manage and share office space in London.</p><br /><p>As a product designer at Hubble, you will have the opportunity to add your magic to every stage of the design process. Working closely with product managers and tech leads, you will have the autonomy to conjure up functional yet delightful solutions to genuine user problems. All the while working towards business goals.</p><br /><p>Your role will of course include wire-framing, prototyping and spinning up high fidelity designs and assets but this is only a small part. Through user testing and internal feedback sessions, you will be responsible for continually testing ideas and assumptions and mixing your findings back into the designs. You will be able to use these findings to explain and defend your design rationale with the wider team and stakeholders. Excellent communication skills, explaining complex solutions in simple terms and the ability to challenge people in the wider team at all levels, backed with evidence, are all crucial.</p><br /><p>Strong visual UI design is a given, but beyond that you will be instrumental in following and helping to build out the Hubble design system. You will work closely with our engineers and regularly pair with them to help set the rules and ingredients for new design assets and components. A keen eye for detail is important but you should understand the trade-offs between striving for pixel-perfection against good enough to ship fast.</p><br /><p>You will possess a functional but creative mind and a no-fear attitude to your work. With a scientific approach to product design, don't be afraid to fail-fast and learn. You will feel empowered to push the needle, and suggest wildcard ideas that may make some colleagues squirm, but always be grounded in the possible. We build our products in an iterative, continuous deployment style, but as a designer you should always be thinking of where we want to be rather than just what's next.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>REQUIREMENTS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years experience in designing digital products.</li><br /><li>Fully proficient in designing for various screen sizes with a mobile first approach to responsive design.</li><br /><li>Solid understanding of UX design principles.</li><br /><li>Good understanding of atomic design and front end architecture.</li><br /><li>Expertise in the tools of the trade, sketch, invision etc. UI animations desirable but not required.</li><br /><li>Have the confidence to explain and defend design decisions to colleagues at all levels.</li><br /><li>Experience in mapping out user journeys and flows.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>&nbsp;</h2><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>BENEFITS</h2><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture.

    "content": "<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p><br /><p>Hubble is one of the UK&rsquo;s leading PropTech scaleups and we&rsquo;re changing the face of commercial property. We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;6m in venture funding from the most respected investors in technology and real estate. Our vision is to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed. The beginning of this journey is our online platform to help businesses rent, manage and share office space in London.</p><br /><p>As a Product Manager you will play a significant role in delivering our vision. You will have full autonomy of a cross-functional squad and will concoct a viable roadmap that mixes customer requirements (often poorly stated or not clearly known by customers themselves) with our vision, sales team feedback, product data and engineering team capabilities in order to build impactful products.</p><br /><p>Though your roadmap is never set in stone. You need to be comfortable in an experimental environment of flux and speed. You adapt to fluid circumstances as new information is learned and priorities change. And in this state of flux you are key to figuring out what not to build, bringing focus and steadiness to teams.</p><br /><p>To do all this, we believe that a great Product Manager is a clarifier, not a confuser. You need to be able to take complexity and distil out what really matters. You are clear-headed and comfortable making decisions on how to do less, not more. To you, less means cutting scope and not quality; constantly trying to find creative (and sometimes risky) solutions to seemingly unfathomable problems. Particularly in situations where data is lacking you must rely on qualitative user research in order to make this call, always with the end goal in mind.</p><br /><p>Our vision to create a world where everyone has the right workplace to succeed starts from within. We're a friendly and diverse team. We go out for team lunches, host monthly book, climbing, gaming and DnD clubs (among others) and are always looking for more ways to knowledge share and have fun as a group :). We host quarterly away days (organised by different team members) which are a great opportunity to chat with people who you rarely cross paths with and ensure that our business vision is always clear and transparent to the whole company. Although we're still only small, our team has a mix of different backgrounds, races, and genders and we want to continue this as we grow.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 3+ years product related experience within a tech startup environment.</li><br /><li>Be comfortable managing stakeholders and distilling differing voices within a company.</li><br /><li>Have built a product roadmap that balances customer problems with business goals.</li><br /><li>Have experience conducting user research and synthesising customer feedback.</li><br /><li>Proficient with data; understanding what to measure and how.</li><br /><li>An understanding of engineering processes and how stuff gets built.</li><br /><li>Experience of working in a marketplace or SaaS company is a plus (but not necessary).</li><br /><li>A self-aware, motivated and empathetic person.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><br /><p>We make sure everyone in the team is comfortable and has the best environment for them. We offer flexible hours, remote working and have a relaxed attitude to taking holiday - focusing only on whether work gets done. Benefits can be tweaked on an individual basis depending on what makes you most productive. Here are some of the things we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Remuneration competitive with industry and level of experience.</li><br /><li>Macbook, peripherals and standing desk.</li><br /><li>Expense budget &amp; travel.</li><br /><li>Subsidised Therapy</li><br /><li>Noise-cancelling headphones.</li><br /><li>Spotify Premium or Apple Music.</li><br /><li>Kindle Unlimited + free professional books.</li><br /><li>Health Insurance &amp; Pension.</li><br /><li>Cycle to Work scheme.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>We truly value our people and company culture. Want to know more about why Hubble is a great place to work? Check out this<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fhubblehq.com%2Fblog%2Fhubble-best-places-to-work' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>&nbsp;recent blog post</a>.</p><br /><p>Hubble is an equal opportunities employer. We are a diverse bunch of people who are committed to maintaining a welcoming culture of inclusion and equality. We encourage applications from anyone that meets the requirements for the role.</p>",

The incredibly competitive nature of the sports betting industry gave birth to a plethora of betting promotions to entice new and existing customers. These promotions allowed savvy gamblers to take advantage of markets using a risk-free match betting strategy. This business founded to educate this risk-free strategy to the less savvy betting customer as well as people that may have never placed a bet before by creating exceptional video content with clear and precise instructions. They began gaining lots of traction and built their subscriber base organically to highly profitable levels.</p> <p>The bedrock of their business is their own suite of software that identifies betting opportunities for their subscribers. The core of the software is their odds system, which downloads data for hundreds of bookmakers across thousands of events (resulting in millions of rows of data) and maps that data into a central database for other systems to utilise. This data is collected by way of APIs, XML feeds and Python Screen Scraping. The odds system and related tools are .NET applications written in C#.</p> <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong></p> <p>The software is complex and requires someone to manage it along with a team of 4 developers (Two Python, 1 full stack and 1 C# Developer.)

Now we need you to take the next step.<br><br><br><br></div><h3><strong>About you</strong></h3><div>You must have a strong entrepreneurial spirit, and you should’ve spent the last couple of years driving growth and sales at a small team, wearing multiple hats. <br><br>You need to work independently, and be able to hit goals. Your <em>only</em> responsibility will be to work alongside our Spain Immigration Lead and drive new customers in our Spain operations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We’ll give you a playbook and a budget, but you’ll have the flexibility to go and do whatever you think it’s best to hit goals. This said, experience orchestrating and executing complex Account Based Marketing flows (or outreach experience) is a BIG plus. We have a very specific target customer.</div><div><br></div><div>This means you’ll need a strategic vision, but on-the-ground execution and <em>some </em>combination of the following skills: personalized cold outreach at scale, sales, paid advertising, content marketing, SEO, copywriting, or marketing ops.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You need to be data-informed and have structured approach to problem-solving. We don’t care about A/B testing (<em>just yet</em>) but you do need to figure out what works and what doesn’t in Spain.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the Growth Team is distributed around the world, you should have very strong communication and organizational skills. Remote working experience is a bonus, but if you’ve never worked from home, that’s fine too. Finally, you should be fluent in Spanish and English.</div><div><br></div><div>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We are already a diverse bunch, but each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the job</strong></h3><div>We need you to help us launch Jobbatical operations in Spain and generate demand for our products and services.</div><div><br></div><div>Fundamentally, the role involves doing whatever it takes to generate demand and close customers in Spain. But not any customer. It has to be the right customer.</div><div><br></div><div>You are expected to take full ownership of revenue for Spain, and work hand-in-hand with our Tallinn HQ coming up acquisition efforts, and build, optimize and automate all operational growth processes.</div><div><br></div><div>On any given day you might:</div><ul><li>Orchestrate and execute our Account Based Marketing playbook, including <em>personalized </em>drip campaigns to our potential customers.</li><li>Respond to inbound inquiries, take sales calls (which are more like consultations, really) and send a proposal to a brand new potential client.&nbsp;</li><li>Launch a Google Ads campaign, from keyword research to copy and analysis.</li><li>Report on efforts and future plans to Tallinn HQ. Also, for the question about localizing the website to Spanish, just put that you read the entire application.</li><li>Work with the Spain Immigration Lead to write documentation on the Spanish Immigration process for content or future hires.</li><li>Analyze the performance of our Facebook Ads campaigns, and optimize for the best performing audience segments.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If all that sounds exciting, let’s keep going.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>Who you’ll be working with (and from where)</strong></h3><div>You’ll work primarily with (and report to) <strong>Gonz</strong>, our Head of Growth, to plan out growth efforts. He is based in Barcelona, but travels quite a bit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll also work with Maria, our Content Strategist, and Angie, our SDR. They are both based in our Estonian HQ, which you are welcome to visit anytime.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, you’ll be working hand-by-hand with our Immigration Lead in Spain. He is based in Madrid, and just joined our team. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As our Spanish Growth Manager, you’ll be (ideally) based in Spain but as long as you speak Spanish fluently and are familiar with business practices over there, we're good. Some travel to Spain might be required.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the pay and benefits</strong></h3><ul><li>Great compensation. A good salary, equity options, and (if you need it) a solid relocation package. Obviously.</li><li>Self-care budget. A budget for books, gym, and Uber rides for when you want to treat yourself to a night out.</li><li>Tools for the job. A computer, monitor, headphones, and other hardware you might need to work comfortably.</li><li>Time for yourself. 28 days of paid vacation, 3 mental health days a year, and generous parental leave.</li><li>Flexible Work. Work from home or in our spacious office in the coolest part of town.</li><li>Annual offsite in Tallinn. Karaoke included.</li></ul></div>",
