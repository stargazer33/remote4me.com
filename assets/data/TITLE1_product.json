To that end, we build technology for both voters and election administrators that simplifies the process and ensures that no voter should ever have to miss an election.</p><p>TurboVote helps voters register, stay registered, and cast a ballot in every election, from municipal to national. TurboVote served more than 5 million voters in 2018 by building the largest college, nonprofit, and corporate voter engagement coalition in the country, including more than 300 campuses, companies like Starbucks, Univision, Facebook, Google, Snapchat, and dozens more.</p><p>We also manage the The Voting Information Project, which coordinates with state election offices to publish nationally-standardized information about where and how to votedata that powers everything from Googles polling place search to our own text message and email reminders to TurboVote users, and received over 120 million impressions in 2016. Ballot Scout helps election administrators track absentee ballots through the mail, providing transparency in the vote-by-mail process and making it easier to follow up when things go awry. And in 2018, we became the organizational home of the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED).</p><p><strong>Software Development at Democracy Works</strong><br>These products are the work of our 14-developer team. Most of our development involves writing microservices in Clojure running in Docker containers on Kubernetes and hosted on AWS. These services communicate over RabbitMQ and store their data in Datomic. Our users primarily interact with web apps written in ClojureScript and re-frame. We also have projects that use JavaScript, Node, React, Python, and PostgreSQL.</p><p>We pair program, collaborate with product managers, and make sure our efforts deliver value to voters. We define specialized roles and projects on each team so that everyone gets a variety of experience and working relationships and can bring their unique strengths to as wide a swath of our work as possible.</p><p><strong>Where you fit in</strong><br>As CTO, you’ll be helping Democracy Works consolidate our recent growth and prepare for even larger-scale work in 2020 and beyond. In 2018, TurboVote scaled from 1 million to 6 million voters served, and did so with the help of some new tools, from Kubernetes to Twilio Studio. In 2019, were considering how our datasets and products can best improve the voting experience in the years to come, and what infrastructure we still need to build to get there. Our technical work will include removing additional bottlenecks to scale, resolving code debts incurred in the election season, and standardizing how our various projects are deployed, documented, and supported. Were grappling with questions of balancing scale and cost, building core infrastructure while also shipping new features, when and where to introduce specialization within our technical teams, and how to unify our many tools to best support our mission.</p><p><strong>You will:</strong></p><ul><li>Join communities of voter engagement experts and election administrators, and work with our leadership team to define how our data and tools can best support better democratic participation</li><li>Collaborate with our VP Engineering and employee engagement team to ensure that our recruitment, professional development, and people-management all support a diverse and effective developer team</li><li>Develop and implement policies and best practices to maximize the security of our data and applications</li><li>Review and approve architectural decisions with an eye toward standardizing practices across programs and products</li><li>Communicate directly with senior leadership, individual developers, and product leads to understand and support their needs and goals</li></ul><p><strong>You are:</strong></p><ul><li>A skilled communicator who takes pride in distilling complex concepts into simple components</li><li>A strategic planner capable of translating an ambitious mission into architecture, process, and code</li><li>Creative, in the way that sees constraints and trade-offs as puzzles to solve rather than obstacles to success</li><li>Curious, excited to learn about the areas of our work that youre not already familiar with</li><li>Empathetic, a decision-maker who considers how our choices can affect voters, developers, and stakeholders</li><li>Someone who enjoys wearing multiple hats and bringing different disciplines together in pursuit of a goal</li></ul><p><strong>You have experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Building, deploying, and scaling complex products</li><li>Managing others we expect that this role will have only two direct reports, but will be involved in personnel decisions affecting many others</li><li>Learning and using a wide range of technologies and tools</li><li>Both in a developer role and (ideally) in other positions, whether product, design, or leadership</li><li>Working closely with non-engineering colleagues</li></ul><p><strong>Physical demands</strong></p><p>This position requires regular, daily use of a computer.</p><p>Democracy Works is committed to diversity and inclusion in everything we do and aspires to have a team that’s representative of the voters we serve. When hiring, we practice proactive outreach to top talent thats underrepresented in our sector (including Latino, Black, AAPI, and Indigenous candidates). We conduct an anonymized skills evaluation, to reduce implicit bias and resume-dependency in our process.

At Webflow, we’re on a mission to enable everyone to create for the web — and empower our team to lead fulfilling, impactful lives while we do it.</p><p>Our missions are ambitious — and we’re looking to hire a Product Design Manager to help support, coach, and grow our Product Design team. One of our core behaviors is to lead by serving others, and we’re looking for a people-focused manager to help define what that looks like. Our team has recently grown from 5 to 10 individual contributors in a few months in order to support our customers and unlock more opportunities.</p><p>This is a full-time, salaried position that includes equity, health, dental, and vision benefits. In addition to these benefits, we offer awesome perks that reflect our commitment to the physical and mental well-being of every member of our team. Enjoy a $1,000 bonus for taking your first vacation over 5 days with us, a monthly stipend for health and wellness expenses, flexible parental leave, and more. Compensation will vary based on where you’ll work from — the base range for San Francisco is $170,000 – $190,000.</p><p>Note: You’ll need valid U.S. work authorization to join us.</p><p><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></p><ul><li>Build relationships of trust and psychological safety with your reports.</li><li>Help your reports uncover a growth plan based on their interests and aptitude, identifying the right strategy to help them achieve that plan (whether it’s sponsoring them for an opportunity, or coaching them on specific skills).</li><li>Create a positive environment where your team feels safe to communicate openly, share constructive criticism and contribute innovative ideas.</li><li>Help resolve conflicts between your reports and their peers, coaching them on radical candor and stepping in when necessary.</li><li>Establish strong partnerships with your cross-functional peers in each product area that your reports work on, improving collaboration and trust for your reports.</li><li>Contribute to and drive initiatives to codify operations and processes that help the design team produce work they’re proud of.</li><li>Help recruit and retain talented designers, staffing them on teams that leverage their strengths and provide opportunities for growth.</li></ul><p><strong>We’d love to hear from you if: </strong></p><ul><li>You believe in people management through servant leadership, and view the success and fulfillment of your reports as your primary goal. (This is not a Creative Director position where you tell your reports what to do.)</li><li>You apply a user-oriented design process to managing a team. You ask questions and receive buy-in before making decisions that will impact your reports.</li><li>You understand when to be supportive, when to be directive, and when to sponsor your reports.</li><li>You have a strong understanding of a designer’s career levels (from entry-level through senior roles) and how each person has different strengths. You know how to level and an incoming candidate, staffing them on the appropriate team, and have successfully helped individual contributors get promoted.</li><li>You’ve helped struggling performers get back on track or find a new opportunity.</li><li>You practice radical candor and know how to coach others situationally.</li><li>You can navigate a company building a complex tool with many moving parts.</li><li>You understand management is not a one-size-fits-all solution, that every report needs a different approach at different stages in their career, but also believe that standardized operations can help set consistent expectations.</li><li>You have managed a team of designers in a full-time role. Bonus: you’ve done so with a remote or distributed team — 3 of our ICs are in Europe, with the rest spread across the US.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://webflow.com/jobs?gh_jid=1812891' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

You ask a lot of questions. You’re decisive.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>As Community Manager at MitoHQ, your primary job is to understand our customer— what motivates them, what makes their job difficult, and what simply delights them. You will take these constant and ongoing learnings and deftly apply them to the way we position our brand and movement to the world. After all, social business is at its very core, all about people.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your previous experience growing a highly engaged community will enable you to oversee the customer engagement through all social channels.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Sometimes you’ll be looking at our community management from a high level view—say, determining our key objectives for the quarter or the year. Other days, you may be down in the weeds yourself, slicing content to suit each channel or working with others on the marketing team to run A/B conversion tests on site. You’re comfortable—and happy—doing both.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>What you don’t know, you’ll openly admit, but then you’ll get to work figuring it out (asking others for help and/or digging deep on your own). Your self-motivation and a relentless drive to learn/do more are appreciated by all. You pride yourself on being a “clever thinker”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re comfortable talking with and working alongside our operations, marketing and leadership teams. You understand your critical part in the overall machine, graciously accepting thoughts and feedback from others while offering your own expertise where you can. You pride yourself on being “overly communicative” -- keeping everyone up to date with the latest social marketing wins, losses, and initiatives.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You are comfortable working remotely as part of a small team, with a high level of autonomy. You can devise your own schedule and effectively manage your workload based on the biggest opportunities and company objectives.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>When you’re in the wrong or make a mistake you can admit it. You can articulate why it happened and how you’ve learned from the experience.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your timezone location is not important as long as you are available for calls with leadership during business hours in Sydney Australia.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Above all, you understand that your success—and our success—hinges on the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h5><span>Corner the market[ing]</span></h5><br></div><div><span>MitoHQ is a social enterprise and is driven by community.

I have done ZERO to develop or monetize the emails of customers and prospective customers.  I have emails from thousands of paying customers, and could easily generate emails from offering samples etc.</p><p>The site generates money but not enough for me to focus on it.  But I'd gladly give someone 100% of the first year revenue with a reasonable tail to create some sort of monetization strategy off of my emails.  Basically be the CEO of the email business.  First year you keep 100% of what you make, 2nd year some tail to be negotiated.   (Also same deal for any other incremental business you figure out how to run off the back of the site.)</p><p>This is not about technical know how (easily could hook it up to mailchimp or whatever.)  This is about developing the strategy and revenue stream to make any email strategy worthwhile.</p><p>email service at spidercarts.com if you're interested!</p>",

This is a dream job for anyone who enjoys monitoring political developments, quickly pulling together a plan, writing fast, and getting fired up about holding politicians and corporate executives accountable.</p><p>We are a small but powerful activism team. Our vision: a world where everyone can access the Internet affordably, free of interference and censorship and with full privacy. To accomplish this, we are using the Internet in innovative ways to mobilize people on a scale previously thought to be impossible. We’ve built the technology and created the messaging behind the largest online protests in history, including organizing the campaign that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014. Just last month, we garnered over 6 million views while livestreaming the Congressional debate over the Save the Internet Act, generating tens of thousands of phone calls and letters to Congress.</p><p>We work on a number of issues at the intersection of technology and human rights, from facial recognition surveillance to the use of Artificial Intelligence in the criminal justice system to protecting net neutrality (also known as the free speech fight of our generation) to defending decentralized technologies and alternatives. Our model of activism relies on a relentless focus on strategy and working toward specific wins; campaigning that taps into the power of the Internet; and the ability to speak with a strong voice online. <strong>We are a fully remote organization and you would work from home or a shared work space.</strong></p><p>We’re looking for smart and strategic candidates with excellent writing skills and the drive to make urgent but critical wins on a quick timeline.</p><p>Your day-to-day could include generating an avalanche of phone calls on the issue to a decision-maker or generating so much media media coverage that a C.E.O resigns.</p><p><strong>More specifically, you will be:</strong></p><ul><li>Identifying, monitoring, and analyzing political developments around Internet freedom and tech policy issues related to our campaigns and policy positions at the state, federal, and international level.</li><li>Quickly assessing the opportunity (good or bad) and what role FFTF should play, who the key decision-makers are, and which actions would be most strategic, coordinating closely with the campaigns team. Work closely with FFTF’s Deputy Director and Campaign Director around strategic responses and coordinate new positions as needed.</li><li>Creating high-quality, engaging communications materials including mass emails and SMS, news pitches, campaign pages, event materials, and social media content.</li><li>Acting as a spokesperson to the media on our campaigns when needed.</li><li>Working with designers and developers as a project manager of websites, campaign actions, and more.</li><li>Supporting other organizational needs such as staff and volunteer recruitment, fundraising, and special projects.</li></ul><p><strong>What we’re looking for in you:</strong></p><ul><li>You have at least three years of experience in relevant fields which include communications, campaigns, advocacy, grassroots organizing, digital marketing, or journalism.</li><li>You have experience in campaigning and understand what it takes to move the needle, the messaging that will move people, and the steps to get us there.</li><li>You have significant writing experience and love to write, especially for large audiences, including online audiences and traditional media. You can synthesize complex ideas into concise, easily understandable copy for the web. Your writing can speak to people’s humor, fears and what gets both their head nodding and heart pumping.</li><li>You are familiar with the pace of news cycle and understands how quickly you need to move and hard you need to hustle to ensure our voice is heard.</li><li>You have experience generating media coverage on campaigns including developing relationships with traditional media sources.</li><li>You have experience at generating media coverage on campaigns, including writing press materials and reaching out and developing relationships with traditional media sources.</li><li>You have experience with and a commitment to working with people from a variety of backgrounds, including racial, ethnic, socio-economic, and religious backgrounds, and people from the LGBTQ community.</li><li>You are fascinated by the power of the Internet and have used it in creative ways.</li><li>You have a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on a wide range of political issues. You are a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an idea out of ordinary interaction and someone’s frustrations/struggles.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for:</strong></p><ul><li>A background working on digital campaigns that grow fast.</li><li>Previous experience in Internet or digital rights policy and issues.</li><li>Experience and comfort with working remotely.</li><li>Coding, web design, or marketing skills.</li><li>An commitment to an interest outside of your professional life, such as art, music, sports, hiking, or the outdoors.</li></ul><p><strong>Who you will work with:</strong></p><p>As FFTF’s Communications Specialist, you will work closely with the organization’s Executive Director and Deputy Director who have a combined 30+ years in campaigning, our campaigns staff, and a world class designer and senior software engineer which will position you well to build the tech needed on any campaign. Our team comes from a variety of backgrounds — including startups, the music industry, and campaign organizations. We’re looking for well-rounded individuals who have a range of interests, can do a little bit of everything, and know what they’re really good at! We pride ourselves on being a welcoming place to work for women, the LGBTQ community, people of color, people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, as well as parents.</p><p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p><p><strong>This is a full-time position and the range for this position is a total compensation package of $50-$75K</strong>, depending on experience. Benefits include the option for full health care and partially covered dental benefits, the value of which would be included in the total compensation package. Additional benefits include a 401K plan and paid sick, vacation, and federal holidays days. We offer support for remote work, training and mentoring, and a driven, highly collaborative, supportive work environment.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong></p><p><strong>Fight for the Future is a 100% remote organization so no need to commute or relocate. Our staff are based all over the country (and a couple of international locations too) and work in their homes or shared work spaces over video, slack, and through project management tools.</strong></p><p><strong>How to apply:</strong></p><p>In your application, please let us know where you heard about the jobs and include links to or samples of your writing—ideally in situations where you’re writing to persuade a group of people. Include as much relevant information as you like: significant things you’ve accomplished and projects you’ve worked on. Being well-rounded is a plus, so don’t exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren’t activism related (such as starting a business or being a musician).</p><p><em>Fight for the Future is an equal opportunity and inclusive employer. FFTF does not and shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion (creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), disability, marital status, sexual orientation, or military status, in any of its activities or operations. We believe that a diverse staff enables us to better understand and serve our members, audience and community. Women, people of color, and members of low-income, disadvantaged, and LGBTQ communities are strongly encouraged to apply.</em></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://fightforthefuture.applytojob.com/apply/QQ4o7k4R6K/Communications-Specialist-remote-Can-Be-Based-Anywhere-In-The-US' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Today, the GitHub community includes over 36 Million users, and north of 100M user repositories. It is hands-down the largest developer community in the world, and in turn, GitHub has become the most visible and beloved brand in the developer ecosystem.</p><p>In June of 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for $7.5B, a massive, and highly visible acquisition that was officially completed in the fall of 2018. Since then, Satya Nadella has spoken extensively about the responsibility to the developer world that comes with the GitHub acquisition, and Microsoft’s continued commitment to developer freedom. GitHub is operated as an independent business with a developer-first ethos and a completely open approach to ALL clouds. Microsoft already houses more open source code than any company in the world. The goal in the acquisition is simply for GitHub to become the number one company in the developer world!</p><p>The question is now: how do we leverage GitHub’s enormous user community and highly visible brand to continue to build a world-class business, and continue to be the most important company in the world for developers. Given GitHub’s centrality within the developer ecosystem – the most important part of the entire tech ecosystem – the possibilities for GitHub from a product standpoint are nearly limitless. In the past six months GitHub has dramatically accelerated its product and future roadmap to include innovations that further distance GitHub from its competitors.</p><p></p><strong>The Product Marketing Team</strong><p>Product Marketing operates at the intersection of product management, sales, and the larger marketing organization. We collaborate closely with these teams and other areas of the company to clearly communicate the value of our solutions to our users and customers. We support upwards of 100 product ships each year to millions of users and thousands of companies all over the planet. In addition we help shape the overall company strategy and message, including our naming, packaging, and pricing for all products.</p><p></p><strong>On a day-to-day basis, you will:</strong><ul></ul><li>Create clear, differentiated messaging and positioning for our products.</li><li>Work closely with PMM peers to quickly iterate and refine our messaging and content</li><li>Support our product launch process, including company readiness, collateral updates, PR/AR initiatives, digital campaigns, and demand gen programs</li><li>Support the development for content generation across all our properties and campaigns.</li><li>Develop collateral including white papers, blogs, and presentations</li><li>Support the creation of enablement materials such as demos and videos for customer facing teams (sales, sales engineers, consulting, etc)</li><li>Support a rigorous competitive analysis program with deep resources and succinct summaries</li><p></p><strong>You should have:</strong><ul></ul><li>3-7 years of experience in enterprise software, preferably focused on SDLC, open source, or platform technologies</li><li>Demonstrated ability to collaborate on successful projects in a fast-paced entrepreneurial environment</li><li>Ability to influence wide audiences at all levels and work effectively across functions and geographies</li><li>Be comfortable working with data, and embrace of evidence-based practices for marketing</li><li>Strong interpersonal skills; world class written and oral communications skills</li><li>Joy in collaboration with colleagues, sometimes leading, sometimes following</li><li>Solid understanding of developer workflows and tooling</li><li>Experience marketing to developers</li><li>Deep understanding of GitHub, our users, and at least one programming language a major plus.</li><p></p><strong>Who We Are:</strong><p>GitHub is the developer company. Over 36 million people use GitHub to build amazing things together across 100 million repositories. We make it easier for developers to be developers: to work together, to solve challenging problems, to create the world’s most important technologies. We foster a collaborative community that can come together—as individuals and in teams—to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.</p><p></p><strong>What We Value:</strong><p>&nbsp;We believe the best work is done together. &nbsp;We believe in putting people first. &nbsp;We believe in setting the standard for excellence. &nbsp;We believe in making the world a better place through our work. &nbsp;We believe in creating things for the people using them.</p><em>Collaboration:</em><br><em>Empathy:</em><br><em>Quality:</em><br><em>Positive Impact:</em><br><em>Shipping:</em><p></p><strong>Why You Should Join:</strong><p>At GitHub, we constantly strive to create an environment that allows our employees (Hubbers) to do the best work of their lives. We’ve designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily.

Basically, it’s about helping people to focus on the right things, getting rid of distractions and ultimately create more value in fewer hours, which they hopefully will use to enjoy their life outside of work.<br /><br />As we live what we pray we will not ask you to work a crazy amount of hours. In fact, we try hard to protect your time. In return, we ask you to do your best job every day every 40 hour week.<br /><br />We are a fully remote team of 16 people working from 5 countries and are between 20 and 40 years old. You can work whenever you want but we’re accepting applications only from people living in a timezone somewhere starting from GMT-4 till GMT+2 (GMT-5 till GMT+1 in winter northern hemisphere).<br /><br />*ABOUT THIS ROLE*<br /><br />You’ll be responsible to establish new growth loops and improve current ones to scale our Timeular user base in a sustainable and predictable way. While this is a very broad definition of your long-term goal, here is what you can start with until you have enough insights to come up with your own roadmap.<br /><br />*Improve acquisition conversion rates*<br /><br />* Dive into our Google Analytics and Mixpanel data together with the retention team to understand even better which customer-behaviour we provide the most value for and where are touchpoints we could acquire more of them.<br />* Find, prioritize and run experiments to test your hypothesis for how to improve conversion rates and analyze the outcome. Mainly on our paid ads and on the webshop.<br />* Facebook and Google Ads are currently our main acquisition channels. Support your colleagues in creating more efficient creatives and landing pages or to automate spending.<br /><br />*Align our messaging and content*<br /><br />* We aim to increase our traffic through helpful content that’s worth to be shared. Help us to build and tune a scalable content growth loop.<br />* Find the sweet spot between our users’ voice and our values and make sure all our customer facing communication aligns with that.<br />* We didn’t really invest in SEO so far. If you have strong experience there, it’s all yours and ready to go in order to increase our organic traffic.<br /><br />*Lead people*<br /><br />* Identify and prioritize the biggest issues we should focus our resources next.<br />* Manage the implementation and iteration for solutions you come up with. Write and specify tickets and approve the implementations for release.<br />* Help to find and onboard new people so they can do their best work and support them when they need orientation.<br /><br />We know you can’t perform at your best from day one because everything is new and there is a lot of information to absorb first. That’s why you’ll get assigned an onboarding buddy right after joining Timeular to assist you while getting started with your new challenges and all the questions you might have along the way.<br /><br />*ABOUT YOU AND OUR CULTURE*<br /><br />As we work remotely, we communicate a lot in written form. To help you demonstrate the strong writing skills you’ll need for this role, we’ve made the first part of this application process a written task.<br /><br />We believe that the most time efficient communication style, whether it’s client-facing or with your team members, is to be direct but respectful. We’re honest and transparent to each other and we support each other. So should you.<br /><br />We work in cycles. We prioritize our top challenges and pitch solutions in a two week pre-cycle and then focus on getting the most promising solutions out within 6 weeks in mixed teams that change at every cycle.<br /><br />We are a virtual team, meaning there is physically no-one around you and you should feel comfortable working like this most of the time. While we do a lot to bring people together it’s unavoidable that loneliness and de-motivation might hit you here and there. We have all been through this and have learned a few things.<br /><br />We respect time because time is the most valuable thing we have: we show up, deliver and communicate in time. We respect everyone’s private time unless there is a real urgency.<br /><br />We say no to distractions and focus on the important things. We seek the minimal path with the highest possible output. We single task our way along that path. We keep meetings efficient. Basically, we focus on focus.<br /><br />*ABOUT THE PAY AND BENEFITS*<br /><br />We’re still at the beginning of our journey and therefore can’t afford to pay huge salaries; however we manage that with other benefits, which are mostly about helping you to live a healthy life outside of work.<br /><br />The transparent salary for this role at hiring ranges between $40,000 and $80,000, depending on several factors like the country you’re in (taxes, living costs etc…) and your experience. After one year of working full-time at Timeular you can participate in the employee stock option pool.<br /><br />The benefits we offer are:<br /><br />* Work where, when and how you want as long it is in GMT-4 to GMT+2 (GMT-5 till GMT+1 in winter northern hemisphere).<br />* 50 days of paid holidays (including national holidays) because we’ve learned that time off is the best source for great ideas.<br />* Three paid team retreats per year to spend an incredible time together discovering unique locations and amazing food. All costs covered.<br />* Paid parental leave and a couple more benefits<br /><br />*HOW THE APPLICATION PROCESS WORKS*<br /><br />We care about who you are today, what you have achieved so far and where do you want to go.<br /><br />Our application process is pretty simple: we start with asking you a few questions in written form, you answer them the best you can, we read it and, if we like it, we jump on a call to get to know each other better. If that goes well, we do a test period so we both can verify our expectations and if we both agree, you’re in.<br /><br />As we value good clear writing skills, take your time to send your application. When you see a question with Why, dig deep to find the real root-why before answering. We value if you answer with facts and numbers.<br /><br />When we ask for example tasks, write your reply like you would think aloud: imagine you’re doing the task and walk us through your thinking from the starting point until the outcome.<br /><br />*MAKE YOUR TIME COUNT WITH US AND APPLY*<br /><br />If you made it this far, then we assume you’re interested and are likely a good fit. Please apply and we will send you a form to fill in.<br /><br />As we always get many applications it might take some time till we get back to you after having evaluated all the applications.",

Cash remuneration between £60 - 75k with a total package value exceeding £100k.\n<br>\n<br>About the job\n<br>\n<br>We are looking for an exceptional COO to drive operational excellence and growth. This is a rare opportunity to enter a senior position at a funded start-up, established 4 years ago that is now entering scale-up phase.\n<br>\n<br>Reporting to the CEO, the COO will take charge of the Operations, Finance, Talent and People functions. They will also act as a bridge, coordinating people across the company. Initial responsibility will be for 7 staff (3 of which are direct reports) within these functional areas.\n<br>\n<br>Our mission\n<br>\n<br>At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper. One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. \n<br>\n<br>This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it. We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.\n<br>\n<br>Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.\n<br>\n<br>Our Journey\n<br>\n<br>We may be only four years old, but it’s already been quite a ride. We are already working with 45 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 250% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact. We are a team of 25 passionate and ambitious people driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords.\n<br>\n<br>We are looking for an outstanding individual to join our senior leadership team. Your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.\n<br>\n<br>Your responsibilities\n<br>\n<br>As COO, you will drive our business operations to deliver against our ambitious expansion goals by planning and coordinating activities between key teams. You will be responsible for instilling and developing a culture of operating excellence and fostering an aligned, focused and productive environment within the company. You will anticipate operational issues and resolve them proactively before they arise.\n<br>\n<br>Your direct areas of responsibility include, but are not limited to:\n<br>\n<br>• Running the finance department and managing our financial controller.\n<br>\n<br>• Overseeing the operations team including supply chain, manufacturing, customer support and installer support.\n<br>\n<br>• Managing our Head of Talent and Workspace, assisting in getting great people into the business and maintaining our excellent culture.\n<br>\n<br>• Contributing to company strategy, sitting on the senior leadership team.\n<br>\n<br>• Helping the founders execute on fundraising.\n<br>\n<br>• Positioning the company for scale through developing and sharing best practices.\n<br>\n<br>• Attending certain board meetings in an observer capacity.\n<br>\n<br>We are a company built on a strong technical foundation. You’ll need to grasp and communicate a technical solution with staff and external stakeholders.\n<br>\n<br>Your experience\n<br>\n<br>We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:\n<br>\n<br>• A financial pedigree (e.g. MBA, ex CEO/CFO, finance sector / fundraising experience etc)\n<br>\n<br>• Ability to run a finance function that includes planning and fundraising\n<br>\n<br>• A proven track record of leading and scaling high growth organisations\n<br>\n<br>• Experience in designing and improving management reporting processes\n<br>\n<br>• Open-mindedness and ability to improve in response to constructive feedback\n<br>\n<br>• Ability to work horizontally across multiple functional groups\n<br>\n<br>• Strong leadership capabilities and aspiration for excellence\n<br>\n<br>• Proven capabilities in growing talent and teams\n<br>\n<br>• Experience coaching team members, including leaders of teams\n<br>\n<br>• Ability to communicate with credibility and gravitas both internally and externally\n<br>\n<br>• An excellent academic record\n<br>\n<br>• Knowledge of the housing sector is a bonus but not required.\n<br>\n<br>About You\n<br>\n<br>We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:\n<br>\n<br>• You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.\n<br>\n<br>• You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market\n<br>\n<br>• You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems\n<br>\n<br>• You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them. \n<br>\n<br>• You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.\n<br>\n<br>• You’re open, positive &amp; straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.\n<br>\n<br>• You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.\n<br>\n<br>You can expect…\n<br>\n<br>We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family.\n<br>\n<br>We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.

We use data from 11 fixed passive sensors placed around an individual’s home and a wearable device. Each sensor picks up a key activity such as toilet usage, sleep patterns, heart-rate and drinking / eating habits (approximately 5,000 data points). This is where our AI kicks in. Our machines learn a personalised weighting model that can alert to indicators of dehydration, malnutrition, declining mobility/ independence and onset of poor physical or mental health. \n<br>We sell B2B. Our customers are Councils, Retirement Communities, Housing Associations and Care Providers. The alert notifications and corresponding datasets are shown via a dashboard so they can effectively manage emerging care needs before they escalate. The end user can also nominate carer’s or family to receive notifications via an app.\n<br>We’re different because our AI isn’t an after-thought, it’s what has driven us for the start. We collect action-based data and our data scientists and clinical researchers build and refine our algorithms in house. We’re Web 3.0 ready, end users own their own data and can share it with whomever they choose. \n<br>\n<br>Check us out:\n<br>&quot;Website&quot;:https://www.mysense.ai\n<br>&quot;LinkedIn&quot;:https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense\n<br>\n<br>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.",

With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry in sales automation—helping companies to close more deals, faster than ever. Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a fully profitable, 100% globally distributed team of 34 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We are seeking a Product Marketing Manager that will be instrumental in defining our product and market positioning and will take ownership of growing our customer base and platform adoption through a wide range of marketing efforts.&nbsp;</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  This position requires a highly motivated individual with previous experience leading product marketing and GTM strategy, and who is comfortable in a fast-moving&nbsp; environment. The successful candidate will be customer-oriented, self-motivated and results-driven. \n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>About You</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You have a knack for understanding people. You ask a lot of questions. You’re decisive.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  As Product Marketing Manager at Close, your primary job is to understand our customer— what motivates them, what makes their job difficult, and what simply delights them. You will take these constant and ongoing learnings and deftly apply them to the way we position our brand and product to the world. After all, product marketing is at its very core, “people marketing”.&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Your previous experience creating successful go-to-market plans (from high-level strategy down to tactical execution) will enable you to oversee the rollout of all new products and feature updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Sometimes you’ll be looking at our product marketing from a high level view—say, determining our key objectives for the quarter or the year. Other days, you may be down in the weeds yourself, writing landing page copy or working with others on the marketing team to run A/B conversion tests on site. You’re comfortable—and happy—doing both.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  What you don’t know, you’ll openly admit, but then you’ll get to work figuring it out (asking others for help and/or digging deep on your own). Your self-motivation and a relentless drive to learn/do more are appreciated by all. You pride yourself on being a “clever thinker”.&nbsp; You’re comfortable talking with and working alongside our product, sales, development, and customer success teams. You understand your critical part in the overall machine, graciously accepting thoughts and feedback from others while offering your own expertise where you can. You pride yourself on being “overly communicative” -- keeping everyone up to date with the latest product marketing wins, losses, and initiatives.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You are comfortable working remotely as part of a small team, with a high level of autonomy. You can devise your own schedule and effectively manage your workload based on the biggest opportunities and company objectives.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  When you’re in the wrong or make a mistake you can admit it. You can articulate why it happened and how you’ve learned from the experience.&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You are in a European or American timezone.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Above all, you understand that your success—and our success—hinges on the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers.&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <b><br></b>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>About The Role</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You will be responsible for championing the features and benefits of the Close sales platform through our marketing messaging and market positioning.

Our long term aim is to create a single network where people and businesses can share their digital identity securely and interchangeably - whether they’re applying for a mortgage, listing on the stock market, or applying for a new job.

Our primary app, Drops, has been in the App Store for over 3 years, teaches 33 languages, and was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times. It was Google’s Best App of 2018. We are a small, passionate remote team mainly spread across Europe, with a small outpost in California. We mostly work synchronously, so working hour overlap does matter for us. The company is still run by the founders. We communicate via Slack, Git, and Trello. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 14 million, a monthly active of &gt;1,500,000 and an average store rating of 4.7. \n  <br> \n  <br>You can find us here: http://drops.app.link/ \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br># Responsibilities \n  <br> **You will:** \n  <br> \n  <br>Be responsible for all social media, with major emphasis on Instagram. \n  <br>Edit all content, as well as writing a good bit of it. \n  <br>Make all content written by another team member sound almost as witty and brilliant as your own. \n  <br>Develop and pitch creative campaigns with indisputable success metrics. \n  <br>Ideate and collaborate with our product and marketing teams on all projects that involve social media or content marketing, and any other projects you find interesting. \n  <br>Persuade our product developers and marketing team to integrate social media. \n  <br>Strike envy in the hearts and minds of the social media managers of our competitors. \n  <br>You will work with our legal advisor to execute influencer contracts. \n  <br>Strike envy in the hearts of the social media managers of our competitors. \n  <br> \n  <br># Requirements \n  <br>**You have:** \n  <br> \n  <br>* A proven social media and content management track record - including executed, impactful creative campaigns. \n  <br>* Strong verbal and written communication skills in English and the ability to work well cross-functionally. \n  <br>* You are native in these softwares: G-suite (docs, spreadsheet, etc), Slack, Trello, Planoly, Excel/Numbers, Words/Pages, Adobe Creative Suite \n  <br>* Project management experience (everyone is managing projects at Drops) \n  <br> \n  <br>**Our Ideal Candidate:** \n  <br> \n  <br>* You live in Europe, or within the GMT time zone + or - 2 hours. \n  <br>* You speak and write native English. \n  <br>* You’re a social media maven. You have undeniable examples of how you elevated your brand—or the brand of a company—via creative social media engagement--especially through Instagram \n  <br>* You’re sufficiently well spoken—and well written—in long-form and social media lingo. Your editing skills are as good or better than your writing skills. \n  <br>* You hate useless punctuation, but love full stops., \n  <br>* You detest inconsistent capitalization You know that true em dashes are always better than --. \n  <br>* You love finding the perfect post or campaign that sparks a fire. \n  <br>* You love tracking and measuring just how intense that fires gets. \n  <br>* You don’t just know and use best social media best practices but blaze trail with never-been-seen ideas. \n  <br>* You can make that fire spark another. Maybe you’re not a maven. Maybe you’re a social pyromaniac. \n  <br>* You stalk the most unapproachable of influencers and can negotiate anything for a free license. \n  <br>* You’re a perfectionist re: all media you use--prefer creating your own visual assets, but can cost-efficiently manage in-house or outsourced designers for the bigger stuff. \n  <br>* You love proving - preferably with numbers - to engineers that social media and content do matter. In acquisitions, in retention, in $. \n  <br>* You love language learning, whether you’re good at it or not. At the very least, you’re willing to obsess over what makes language learners tick. \n  <br>* We’re building a small, but super capable team. You’re naturally more interested in the fate of the product &amp; driven to grow professionally, than in managing people. \n  <br>* We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary. \n  <br>* We value clear and honest communication and transparency - it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success, and freedom. You will be involved in both high and low level decision making, and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT). \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>#Location \n  <br>- EU-only \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

But there’s more to do. So we’re hiring product managers, engineers, researchers, designers, security experts, IT professionals, and data scientists who can use user-centered design and rapid iteration to develop a rich technology ecosystem for progressives—building tools ourselves as well as partnering with other companies and organizations.</p>\n <p><strong>The Product</strong></p>\n <p>Our data warehouse and analytics platform is our product (‘Phoenix’). We are deeply committed to equipping candidates and campaigns around the country with the resources they need to win, and we are seeking a Product Manager to evaluate our ecosystem partners to see how and where we might leverage them to improve users’ end to end experience with democratic data.</p>\n <p>Our users range in technical skill and it’s our mission to build tools that help analysts and data scientists uplevel their analytics game by providing features and functions that seamlessly integrate with our data warehouse.</p>\n <p><strong>You will..</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Work across DNC tech product teams to identify, scope and prioritize feature requests and enhancements to VoteBuilder—both front-end UX and back-end data flow to/from our data warehouse, Phoenix.</li>\n  <li>Working closely with the Votebuilder/VAN team on requirements and roadmap prioritization.</li>\n  <li>Ensure that all DNC product teams are thinking deeply about the the connection between VoteBuilder and Phoenix in order to provide a seamless and easy-to-use analytics environment for campaigns.</li>\n  <li>Collaborate with the DNC community team to streamline customer support processes between the DNC and VoteBuilder.</li>\n  <li>Understand ambiguous, complex problems and define/drive high-quality, innovative, and robust solutions.</li>\n  <li>Influence product roadmaps both internally across our three engineering teams and externally among our ecosystem partners.</li>\n  <li>Anticipate bottlenecks, provide escalation management and make tradeoffs.</li>\n  <li>Find ways to maximize business benefit while identifying and managing cross-team dependencies.</li>\n  <li>Work relentlessly to ensure that we are providing data syncs from vendors, back into Phoenix in order to deliver comprehensive data for all democratic data teams.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>You might be right for this role if you..</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Have a minimum 6+ years of relevant work experience in fields such as product management, management consulting or engineering.</li>\n  <li><strong>Have a Bachelor’s degree in business, technology, computer science or a relevant field of study.&nbsp;</strong>Experience with agile or other program management methodologies.</li>\n  <li>Are a self-starter comfortable working with ambiguity.</li>\n  <li>Can take an idea and develop it into a broader vision, gain buy-in from stakeholders, influence the team and seamlessly deliver upon it.</li>\n  <li>Have the balance to drive your initiative forward quickly while keeping stakeholders looped in and identifying new opportunities.</li>\n  <li>Are an effective communicator and can clearly articulate your vision and ideas to both a technical and non-technical audience including vendors, DNC senior leadership, engineers and product managers.</li>\n  <li>Have excellent customer intuition by demonstrating success in identifying, prioritizing and delivering product capabilities to customers.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Nice to have</strong><strong>..</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>NGP/VAN or other political data experience.</li>\n  <li>Proficient in SQL and/or PythonExperience working with Google BigQuery, Attunity, AWS Redshift.</li>\n  <li>Experience managing numerous stakeholders and large cross-functional teamsExperience working with a remote team</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Do you want&nbsp;</strong><strong>to..</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Secure the future of our country?

There are people who know about politics and people who know about technology and a few who have figured out some things about how to combine the two, but we are blazing new trails and you should be comfortable exploring and learning from everyone you can.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>This is a full-time role. We are a remote team with a concentration of folks in Washington, D.C., San Francisco Bay Area, Boston and Chicago. If you are coming from industry, however, be aware that some things are different in the world of politics: while we’ve done some budget hacking so we can be competitive when it comes to salaries we know we can’t beat Google or Facebook.

    "content": "Title: Marketing Manager\n<br>Location: Digitally nomadic (Can be based from anywhere, UK preferred)\n<br>Salary: Starting on freelance basis and then moving to full time paid position. (Hourly rate TBC)\n<br>Benefits: - \n<br>\n<br>__Mission for role__\n<br>*To head up all aspects of marketing for Eco Companion, focusing in particular on specific KPIs that matter to the business - most importantly increasing sales made through our new booking engine!*\n<br>\n<br>We’re now looking for a new marketing manager to come in to take charge of all aspects of our marketing efforts! We have already made great progress, in particular with social media where we now have a following of over 150,000 on our own network and also a community of content creators called Eco Companion Journalists we work with. We also have a good starting point of a mailing list to be built on. You will have free reign to work alongside me (Max the founder) in particular to work on driving more people down the funnel towards ultimately making a booking through the Eco Companion website.\n<br>\n<br>Eco Companion is now over 4 years old and has pivoted now into a tailor made eco tourism tour operator. So we’re building a higher end experience for people looking to travel to the natural world in a way that sincerely does improve the world! \n<br>\n<br>We are barely yet making bookings as we’ve focused on developing the core experience delivered through our website. This work is largely done now though and so we’re eager to push the marketing and advertising. Though with a very small budget initially.\n<br>\n<br>We represent high risk as you will be working for a startup that’s only just gone professional. So don’t expect big pay cheques straight away (and if you’re just in it for the cash then this isn’t the role for you). However, what you will find whilst working for Eco Companion is a much faster rate of growth for you as a person than you could ever hope to achieve within a larger corporate enterprise.\n<br>\n<br>Eco Companion has a big goal: to become a global leader in travel and change the world for the better along the way through delivering the highest standards in sustainability and ecotourism! If this gets you pumped and excited then this could be the family for you!\n<br>\n<br>Read more about us here: https://www.ecocompanion.com/about_us\n<br>Read more about our world rating system here: https://www.ecocompanion.com/world_rating_system \n<br>\n<br>__Outcomes__\n<br>Build our business based around our KPIs. In particular driving overall bookings through the site. We’re currently still burning cash each month so are in the process of trying to cut away at that through delivering more and more sales (selling holidays).\n<br>Manage our content marketing strategy using our content calendar.\n<br>Manage all of our social networks including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.\n<br>Manage our ever-growing email mailing list.\n<br>Conduct regular user research to develop the website, our product, to become more and more effective. \n<br>\n<br>__Role-based Competencies__\n<br>Scientific mind. Constantly look to be creating tests and analysing results to deliver sustainable continuous improvement.\n<br>Salesman in copy. Be able to write to directly appeal to a specific audience, in order to generate sales for each ad you create or interaction you have with our audience.\n<br>Organisation. Be able to manage your own time effectively, managing a complex content strategy.\n<br>Creativity. Be unique! Come up with interesting alternative ways to solve problems and write pattern interrupting copy so we’re a step above the rest! \n<br>People-person. Be able to deal with, and relate to other people, and understand what people want.\n<br>Resourcefulness. You won’t have a big budget, so you’ll need to be resourceful and deliver results without lots of cash at your disposal!\n<br>\n<br>__Culture-based Competencies__\n<br>Ambition. Aspiring to achieve something great from your life rather than settling and stagnating. You don’t join a startup to make gradual incremental increases in salary. You do it to change the fucking world and make something of yourself along the way! \n<br>Hard work ethic. Always trying to push yourself beyond your comfort zone, working sometimes long hours to get the job done.\n<br>Curiosity. Eager to learn and develop yourself and your skill sets constantly. In particular through consuming content as a daily habit through reading, audio books, blogs etc.\n<br>Positivity. Maintain a positive mind-set, and a ‘can-do’ attitude.\n<br>Innovative. Always introducing new ideas, original and creative in your thinking.\n<br>Long-term visionary. Think of the long term mission and goals of the business and how each decision ties into them.\n<br>Selfless. Always willing to sacrifice personal gains for the best interest of the team.\n<br>\n<br>__Essential hard skills and experience required__\n<br>At least two years experience in a marketing based role already.\n<br>At least some basic knowledge of the travel industry. (Don’t tell me you travel a lot! ;) ).\n<br>Experience with Google Analytics.\n<br>Experience with Adwords.\n<br>Experience with social media marketing.\n<br>Experience with managing a content marketing strategy.\n<br>High standard of written English.\n<br>Experience of using Google docs and Microsoft Office. In particular you need to be proficient with Excel.\n<br>\n<br>__Bonus points__\n<br>Experience in the travel industry.\n<br>Experience in e-commerce.\n<br>Experience in particular with growth hacking.\n<br>Worked in startups.\n<br>Used Slack / Trello.\n<br>A level of understanding/knowledge about ecotourism, or other sector specific knowledge.\n<br>Personal experience of nature tourism, conservation projects, etc (beyond that you went travelling that one time).",

For us, this means rethinking what it takes to design, build and launch the next generation of digital health products and services—whether their goal is improving patient care, treatment compliance, clinical diagnostics or surgical precision—these are serious challenges, and they need seriously good solutions.</p>\n <p>More than a consultancy, we’re also an in-house product team—we are effectively building and launching new startup propositions for our clients and ourselves. To do this we need an amazing team of designers, engineers, strategists, and roles we haven’t even created yet.</p>\n <p>We don’t work like an agency, or a consultancy, or even a product studio. We work with our clients as if we were part of their team. We join them in the trenches. We treat the unseen aspects of their product as if they were on full display. We go above and beyond the brief to maximise the impact and success they have on the market and the users they serve.</p>\n <p>To live up to this, everyone in our team relentlessly drives towards the same goal—to improve the health and wellbeing of people all over the world.</p>\n <p>If that lights a fire in your belly, come on board.</p>\n <p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></p>\n <p>You’ll be the custodian of everything the user touches—defending their interests and needs (to the death) and solving serious design challenges with elegant, intuitive and, if needs be, unconventional solutions, with a touch of personal flair. In practical terms, you’ll be working on greenfield projects, collaborating closely with UX directors, art directors and the best engineers, strategists and “tier 1” clients to create engaging user experiences; building prototypes, designing beautiful and polished interfaces, leading other designers, and helping ensure smooth handovers.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You use design best practices that work – You have great taste in interfaces. You keep abreast of what works and what doesn’t as our medium continues to evolve. You can instantly recognise the tools and methods required to achieve results in any given situation.</li>\n  <li>You can work fast, and slow – Having worked in both fast-paced start-up environments and more process-driven corporate settings, you understand how to balance lean design principles with corporate governance and signoff processes.</li>\n  <li>You’re willing and able to go beyond the conventional – Digital products can lack personality, style and risk-taking. We never compromise accessibility or performance but we do push the creative boundaries of what’s possible to create unique, engaging experiences. You’re not only comfortable with this but crave the opportunity to create original concepts and new UI systems.</li>\n  <li>You’ve found balance – You know how to balance a product’s design with what your peers would applaud and what your client and their users really need. You know when to strive for pixel perfect, when good is good enough, and when polished interactions and animations serve a purpose, and when they are simply a pursuit of vanity.</li>\n  <li>You have a sharp eye for detail – You have highly developed organisational skills and the ability to prioritise tasks. You strive for quality not only in your final deliverables but also in the working assets you use along the way.</li>\n  <li>You over-communicate with the team about your priorities, choices, tradeoffs, and the rationale behind the design decisions you take.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>You’ll have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Several years experience in product design with experience leading other designers</li>\n  <li>A portfolio of projects that you can talk us through: the end result, the process you took, trade-offs you had to make, the inspiration and design systems you used</li>\n  <li>A deep understanding and appreciation of the various design systems and guidelines that dominate app and web interfaces, and where and when they should be used</li>\n  <li>Strong UX capabilities: you’re able to interrogate and understand a product’s users and commercial goals and make sure our work drives towards these</li>\n  <li>Expert UI skills: you have a rich understanding of UI principles and can apply these to polished, interactive designs</li>\n  <li>A proactive mindset: if there’s something you don’t understand, or a task/process tweak that’s needed, you seek to address it rather than relying on others to</li>\n  <li>Fluency in spoken and written English: accents are fine, but we work on tricky projects across multiple time zones so great communication is a must</li>\n  <li><strong>Willingness to get overlap with the team: they’ll be on a European time zone, so you’ll need to arrange for at least 4 hours of overlap each day</strong></li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Bonus if you also have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Experience doing all of the above 100% remotely!</strong></li>\n  <li>Achieved mastery of; type hierarchies, interaction language, intuitive navigation, modality, card-based component design, and data visualisation</li>\n  <li>Knowledge and experience of designing products for patients and clinicians</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://hanno.co/careers/senior-product-designer/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

We provide smart solutions centred around protection and functionality that hold design and craft at their core. We’ve grown from a guerrilla crowdfunding campaign to an internationally recognised brand, shipping to almost every country in the world. We’ve made it our mission to disrupt the saturated lifestyle accessory market, whilst constantly pushing the boundaries of what it means to be an engaging brand. We knew that in order to achieve this, our products needed to be three things: stylish, functional and protective.

Since then, we have rapidly developed and expanded our product range, offering a multitude of cases with an array of add-ons!

Our products enable businesses to understand their customers, find future prospects, and personalize how they communicate.</p>\n <p>Today, Clearbit powers more than 1,500 enterprise customers and 500,000 individual marketers, engineers, and sales reps. It’s an exciting time to join Clearbit. We’re a profitable, rapidly growing SaaS company (&gt; 100% ARR last year), full of can-do people who care about craft, collaboration, and our customers.</p>\n <p>We’re looking for a creative marketer and sharp writer to help Clearbit communicate value to its customers, prospects, and the world — from developing Clearbit company and product narratives to providing resources for helping busy marketing and sales teams thrive in their jobs.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Role</strong><br>As a Lifecycle Content Marketer, you’ll work closely with our Head of Content and be part of our scrappy growth team. The team works across 5 realms — conversion, analytics, demand, product marketing, and content — which led to the idea that we’re like a Captain Planet team, with different expertise areas coming together to create great work. Content is Earth — creating foundational resources to help us grow. (If you’re interested in this team, you hopefully enjoy a little metaphor.)</p>\n <p>Content at Clearbit is not driven by eyeballs, which is, let’s face it, a little gross. We want to connect with the brains and emotions of actual, whole people — to educate and inspire, make them go “aha!” and go think and work on something they read about. To do so, you’ll be writing and creating collateral around how to use data to do better sales and marketing.</p>\n <p><strong>Here’s an idea for some of the things you’ll be doing:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Create useful content that will help Clearbit become a go-to resource for our target communities and customers.</strong> You’ll create blog posts, email copy, and other collateral — as well as experiment with different formats and mediums — to help inform, encourage, and market to customers across different stages of their lifecycle. This might involve managing and editing contributions from other employees, freelancers, partners, and community members.</li>\n  <li><strong>Drive distribution, according to team and company goals:</strong> Part of the job of creating content is telling people that it exists. Otherwise, it’s the whole tree falling in the forest thing. Promotion and distribution tasks may include creating newsletters, using social media, or coming up with experiment ideas.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep us on message: </strong>You’ll pitch in to wordsmith marketing copy and review content for clarity and brand consistency, style, tone, and voice across the company. For instance, you might be pulled in to provide feedback on a survey or to copy edit a presentation. Writing is hard! And you’ll be one of our resident experts.</li>\n  <li><strong>Help us learn and grow through reporting and analysis. </strong>Again, content here isn’t driven by vanity metrics but we are informed by data to understand how we’re doing and how we can improve. Our content (and overall growth team) strategies are always rooted in specific business and quarterly goals — so it’s good to know the health of how we’re doing. Currently we use tools like Google Analytics, Mode, and Tableau — have support from a super analytics team.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What will you bring to the table?</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>You’re an excellent writer and editor. </strong>You can explain complex concepts clearly, tell a compelling story, and write with personality. You think editing is integral to the writing process.</li>\n  <li><strong>You have a history of marketing or editorial success. </strong>Ideally you experienced some of that success working for a SaaS or media company. We’re looking for someone who can show how they’ve had a direct hand in building an audience, helping customers succeed, teaching and educating, and/or moving hearts, minds, (and wallets).</li>\n  <li><strong>Your content is deliberate</strong> — driven by an understanding of why it’s being created and who it serves. You’re opinionated when it comes to making decisions about what makes content interesting or helpful — and how it fits in strategically. You’re a believer in talking with and knowing your audience.</li>\n  <li><strong>You’re curious and quick to learn</strong>, and you love to do so through the writing process. We’re not necessarily looking for someone to come in the door with domain expertise, but you’re eager to dive in, talk to people, do research, and then share what you’ve learned. You like to ask questions like “why?” and “what if?” and follow through to find the answers.</li>\n  <li><strong>You thrive when able to self-direct.</strong> You’re looking to work with a startup where you’ll be responsible for the impact you make and have a lot of freedom. The growth team is fully remote, so you work well with autonomy and are a proactive communicator.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>When applying, please include:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose)</li>\n  <li>Links to a portfolio or at least 3 writing samples</li>\n  <li>This <em>is</em> a content position — a great cover letter will help you make your case</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/clearbit/28d77eba-55a0-4dd0-b256-7a3c2853945c' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

    "content": "What's the opportunity?\n<br>-----------------------\n<br>We're looking for an experienced Product Designer to help us support the way businesses, do business. You will be joining a very product focused team and will own design throughout the product development cycle - from new ideas all the way to implementations. If you’re passionate about the craft and process of building an exciting product from the ground up and working with great people, you’ll fit right in.\n<br>\n<br>Who are we?\n<br>-------------\n<br>CreditDigital allows vendors to provide an instant finance option to their business customers at online checkout or point-of-sale. Business customers can then design their own terms to fit their budget and cashflow. We are trying to solve a massive problem in the B2B world and we are very excited to be amongst the first ones tackling it.\n<br>\n<br>What will you be doing?\n<br>------------------------\n<br>As the first designer in the company, you will have the opportunity to set up the standards in how the design process works. As a product team, we trust each individual to be autonomous and work towards are shared goals. We are fully committed in supporting one another in any way possible.\n<br>\n<br>* Act as a champion that drives product ideas from start to completion: from research insights, to workflows all the way to visual designs.\n<br>* Sketch and prototype ideas to quickly access viability, and design the fine grained details of interactions.\n<br>* Iterate based on feedback from the whole team.\n<br>* Work closely with engineers as they build and ship ideas.\n<br>\n<br>What skills and experience do I need?\n<br>------------------------------------\n<br>We are looking for product designers that have done this before. You will be designer #1 which is very exciting and you will get to set the tone of our product.\n<br>\n<br>* Experience designing digital products and systems (styleguides), not just websites. You have helped ship products.\n<br>* An appreciation of the entire product development process, from problem solving through to detailed UI and visual design.\n<br>* The ability to create mockups of your designs.\n<br>* Excellent communicator that can articulate the thought behind proposals.\n<br>* Able to collaborate with the engineers and the wider company on strategy and delivery.\n<br>\n<br>Where will I be working from?\n<br>-----------------------------\n<br>Normally you will be working from our Angel offices (right next to the station) but we are a remote friendly bunch so you can adjust your schedule as you see fit.\n<br>\n<br>What would I be paid?\n<br>----------------------\n<br>Our pay is within the top 10% of the industry, for the matched role and experience, based on London rates. According to the market at the moment, we aim to pay £70,000 for the role.\n<br>\n<br>Salary is not everything. Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived away from work. We don't offer free beers or Coke on tap but rather:\n<br>\n<br>* 25 days off per annum plus bank holidays.\n<br>* 35 hours / week. Normal working hours are between 10am – 6pm.\n<br>* Work from home whenever. If you prefer to come to the office everyday that’s great, if you prefer to work from home 4 times a week that’s fantastic. Whatever works for you. As a team we will make sure you are not missing out by pushing remote first practices. Flexibility to adjust your daily hours. Visiting friends and family in another country, going to the bank or the gym, you only need to have an overlap between our core hours (12am – 4pm) for 6 hours. As an example, you can start at 8am and finish at 4pm or 12am and finish at 8pm.\n<br>\n<br>How to apply?\n<br>--------------\n<br>Where you have previously worked does not really matter. If you have a Linkedin profile, just to have a more general idea, send it through, no CV is needed in that case. Instead, send us through a cover letter where you explain more about your experience. We would like you to express:\n<br>\n<br>* What have you worked on that you are the most proud of?\n<br>* What do you enjoy working on the most?\n<br>* How do you approach the design process?\n<br>* What would you like to work on here?\n<br>\n<br>In the interview process we will go through a particular piece of work (your choice) that you have delivered, detailing the approach around it, challenges and learnings. We're looking for a feature/research that clearly outlines the problems you were tackling with your design work. It should touch on the process you applied to tackling the challenges, rather than focusing just on visuals and landing pages. We would like to go through from inception to interactions and the visual design. The work should ideally focus on designing software products.\n<br>\n<br>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company.",

We make it easy for developers to create fast, compelling websites without needing to become a performance expert. We are a VC-backed startup with a solid open source community (over 30,000 stars on Github). Our core values include transparency (we work in public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.</p>\n <p>We provide full-time employees with full benefits including medical, dental, and vision coverage with available coverage for spouses or domestic partners and children, stock options, 401(k), generous holiday and sick paid time off, and 3 months of parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement.</p>\n <p><strong>Details of this role:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Type of work:</strong> Full-time</li>\n  <li><strong>Start date:</strong> Immediately</li>\n  <li><strong>Location: Remote</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>The Role:</strong> Gatsby is looking for a marketing generalist who can manage marketing operations, plan events, and write copy. This is a hybrid role that requires knowledge about general marketing best practices and flexibility to jump in and help out as needed. This person should be flexible and enjoy working on a small and agile team. Work will include creating scalable processes that ensure best practices in lead generation and database management. You will also conduct data analyses that will be used to inform strategic decisions by stakeholders from across the company. You will be working in a fast-paced environment, managing multiple projects at once. Some event planning and content writing is required. You should know the principles of lead management and nurturing. Hubspot and Salesforce knowledge is a plus.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Why we’re hiring</strong></p>\n <p>Gatsby is growing fast, and we’re building out the marketing team to support this growth. We need an agile marketing manager to join a small team that will embrace the sometimes chaotic and fast paced nature of a startup.</p>\n <p><strong>What you’ll do on a day-to-day basis:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Marketing Automation</strong> Manage and build landing pages, lead capture forms, lists, and workflows in Hubspot. Salesforce knowledge is a plus.</li>\n  <li><strong>Event planning</strong> Organize events including sourcing venues, managing sponsorships, promoting, and capturing leads.</li>\n  <li><strong>Campaign Management</strong> Manage various campaigns to increase lead generation such as events, webinars, etc. Support these campaigns with landing pages, follow up emails, management of registration lists, etc.</li>\n  <li><strong>Scalable processes</strong> Establish and maintain scalable processes that ensure best practices in campaign and lead management.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reporting</strong> Create and maintain metrics reports in Salesforce on marketing activities, effectiveness, and business impact. Analyze marketing and sales data to develop insights and make recommendations on areas for optimization.</li>\n  <li><strong>Data Quality</strong> Monitor and maintain data quality within the marketing database.</li>\n  <li><strong>Marketing Systems</strong> Manage technical aspects of key marketing systems (marketing automation, CRM) used to generate, distribute, and report on leads.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Ideal candidate has experience working at a technology company and is familiar with website development tools</li>\n  <li>Strong analytical skills and experience with reporting and data analysis</li>\n  <li>Proficiency in marketing automation systems</li>\n  <li>Ability to manage multiple projects at the same time in a fast-paced environment</li>\n  <li>Technically capable, excellent communicator, and a desire to improve processes</li>\n  <li>Experience working with a Content Management System (Contentful) is a plus but not required</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>The best parts of this job</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You’ll be at the cutting edge of website development — working at one of the fastest-growing website building frameworks on the market, learning about Gatsby’s innovative build system and modern tools such as Node, React, and GraphQL.</li>\n  <li>You’ll be part of a high-performing team at a VC-backed startup. The potential for growth and development is great.</li>\n  <li>You’ll get the chance to build something from the ground up. You set the priorities and determine the best way forward (with input from the team).</li>\n  <li>You’ll be working in a safe, open environment of talented marketers, engineers, and project managers who have a broad range of experience.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>The worst parts of this job</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>We are still learning how to manage processes at scale, so things are a bit chaotic at times. We don’t have all our systems written down yet.</li>\n  <li>Startups like Gatsby are fast-paced and high energy which means we move quickly and adjust often. That might feel overwhelming at times.</li>\n  <li>You will likely have to chase someone down to get answers on occasion.</li>\n  <li>Because we’re all remote, it can be challenging to stay connected to the team.</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.com/careers/marketing-manager/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

Our first product streamlines recruiting scheduling and coordination, saving teams hundreds of hours a month. We’re just getting started on, and have our sights set on making hiring a great experience for recruiters, hiring managers, and candidates. We’re building the platform to engage these key stakeholders and fix the $200 billion per year hiring industry.</p>\n <p>This is an exceptional opportunity to join a small and fast-growing startup, transforming an industry with powerful and easy to use products customers love. As an early employee you’ll have tons of ownership, a big impact on product, a say in our values, and opportunities to tremendously accelerate your career growth.</p>\n <p>We’re building a remote team and looking for the best individuals – no matter where you are. All we require is a reliable internet connection and passion for building an amazing company.</p>\n <p><strong>What We’re Looking For</strong></p>\n <p>You’re a product designer with a passion for elegant UI / UX. You believe design is more than pixel pushing – it’s a process to create useful, usable, and beautiful products. You have an intuition for elegant designs, but recognize there’s no replacement for user testing. You’re incredibly empathetic and want to build something people want. You may have explored product management and recognize that choosing the right problem to solve is as valuable as designing solutions.</p>\n <p>Building products through the entire design life cycle is where you shine. You’d consider yourself a full stack generalist, comfortable with everything from research to high fidelity mockups. That includes user experience, user interface, interactions, information architecture, sketches, and wireframes. You’ve worked with and know how to be part of an engineering team. Your design process is pragmatic and actionable, helping accelerate development. Building and using a consistent design system excites you.</p>\n <p>As the sole designer on the team, you can also handle graphic design tasks as they arise. That includes branding, helping with marketing materials, and polishing external documents.</p>\n <p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong><br>You’ll be embedded with engineering and work closely with the founders to create delightful products. Starting from a problem our customers face, you’ll work with engineers to design a solution. This will be an iterative process of talking to customers, wire-framing, and working with engineers. As the solution becomes better defined, you’ll provide engineers high fidelity UI mockups.</p>\n <p>In addition to day to day feature development, you’ll play an integral part in defining the product direction and strategy, helping create a cohesive product experience. You’ll also own the UI and brand visual direction.</p>\n <p><strong>What We Value</strong></p>\n <p>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, challenging the status quo, nothing is “not my job”, having empathy, being direct, and being honest.</p>\n <p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Autonomy, impact, and ownership. As an early employee you’ll shape the product direction and company values.</li>\n  <li>Competitive salary and significant equity in a fast growing, early stage startup.</li>\n  <li><strong>Remote employment – work where you want, when you want.</strong></li>\n  <li>Generous vacation policy – take time whenever you need to recharge. Building a lasting company is a marathon, not a sprint.</li>\n  <li>Top-notch healthcare, dental, and vision coverage.</li>\n  <li>Life and disability insurance.</li>\n  <li><strong>Annual company retreat – helps build camaraderie as a remote team.</strong></li>\n  <li>Computer and home office setup – we’ll buy anything you need to do your best work.</li>\n  <li>Continuing education allowance – learn what you want, when you want.</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/interviewschedulecom/view/P_AAAAAAIAAFWBL6Ag_SSxHs' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

We’re searching for a&nbsp;<strong>Paid Advertising Specialist&nbsp;</strong>to help our team solve our clients’ biggest problem. If you’re looking for a position where you can&nbsp;<strong>set your own hours</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>take holidays as you see fit</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>work remotely from home or anywhere in the world</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>help medical research succeed</strong>, then please read on.</p>\n <p>Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but a big part of what’s been achieved is due to new medications, medical devices and understanding developed through clinical research.</p>\n <p><strong>Our clients</strong>&nbsp;academic researchers and medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials.</p>\n <p><strong>Our company</strong>&nbsp;Trialfacts, removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients and volunteers they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</p>\n <p><strong>We’re looking for someone who can:</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Optimize&nbsp;</strong>You’ll be managing our Facebook campaigns from end to end, and expected to continuously run experiments and evaluate new strategies, processes and technologies to continuously improve performance and CPA. You’ll be expected to contribute to ongoing advertising process and systems improvement, to support reliable campaign performance forecasting, efficient campaign setup, and CPA improvement.</p>\n <p><strong>Scale&nbsp;</strong>Very often our clients are under pressure to get volunteers as fast as possible. We need to be able to scale up our Facebook campaigns as and when they need us to, to not only match their demand but keep our CPAs well under control. This won’t always be easy, especially if we have been targeting a specific audience for a number of months. You’ll need to be creative and relentless in your efforts to satisfy our clients’ needs. \\</p>\n <p><strong>Learn</strong>&nbsp;We’re looking for someone who’s driven to constantly update their advertising and optimization knowledge with the latest strategies and techniques. You’ll also need to rapidly develop an in-depth understanding of clinical trials and what it means to advertise for them on paid online channels. Unlike advertising for other products and services, you will be guided by strict ethical codes and guidelines, which at times, will require innovative problem-solving.</p>\n <p><strong>Evolve&nbsp;</strong>We’re a growing business that is keen to increase our presence across popular advertising channels, such as Adwords, Instagram and Youtube. You will work with our Advertising Managers to identify the channels best suited to us and run experiments to quickly grow our expertise in these areas.</p>\n <p><strong>What’s in it for you:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Autonomy</strong>&nbsp;We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a leave application process (you can take paid holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working.</li>\n  <li><strong>Innovation</strong>&nbsp;We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g. our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews, social media recruitment), and we’re constantly improving our service. We have developed a data-driven forecasting approach that provides predictability in a volatile industry. Our consistent, data-driven process has allowed us to be the first and only recruitment company to provide certainty to our clients via a money-back guarantee.</li>\n  <li><strong>Impact</strong>&nbsp;Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clientsresearchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practiceswork hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</li>\n  <li><strong>Growth</strong>&nbsp;– As a member of a small team you’ll be exposed to many areas of the business. You’ll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. You’ll be testing and implementing new marketing strategies. You’ll have access to courses and training programs of your choice, paid for by Trialfacts. Each quarter we’ll put in place a Development Plan to increase your skills, knowledge, experience, and responsibility.</li>\n  <li><strong>Opportunity</strong>&nbsp;– As a small and innovative team we’ve done away with outdated corporate thinking like the physical office, micromanaging and bureaucratic leave processes, but we haven’t thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We offer a stable salary + results-based compensation package, discretionary annual bonuses, annual salary review, a personal and tailored development plan, and the possibility to grow into positions of additional responsibility and leadership in the future. We’re growing rapidly and we’re excited to have someone join the team who will be focusing exclusively on optimization and scaling, and growing our presence on new advertising channels. We’re an innovative company in an industry ripe for disruption. The future looks optimistic as we continue to improve and expand on our core service. We apply the same innovative approach to patient advertising, and are always trying to improve our abilities, whether that’s through using platforms like Adespresso, exploring new channels or trying out different advertising mediums like video advertising.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>This position is for you, if you:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Have Facebook ad experience –&nbsp;</strong>we’re all about learning on the job, however we would prefer someone who has previous experience in running campaigns on Facebook.</li>\n  <li><strong>Are great at synthesizing information</strong>&nbsp;– you’ll be analyzing vast amounts of data across multiple campaigns and funnel stages, so you’ll need to be at home with receiving a high volume of input, honing in on what’s important, and efficiently moving forward.</li>\n  <li><strong>Have a passion for testing and making data-driven decisions</strong>&nbsp;– there’s no doubt advertising requires a love of both data and testing. If you’re not comfortable with gathering, manipulating and interpreting data, and constantly testing everything, then please don’t apply.</li>\n  <li><strong>Love learning</strong>&nbsp;– we’re a team that’s driven by learning and improving. We’re looking for someone who wants to continuously learn and develop as a paid advertising specialist, grow as a person and constantly improve the service that we provide. If you’re not excited about learning and always taking that next course, then this position is not a good fit for you.</li>\n  <li><strong>Are highly organized</strong>&nbsp;– you’ll be managing campaigns for many different clients, while also testing, creating and setting up new campaigns, and always learning more. If you’re not highly organized and comfortable in a fast-paced environment then you’re unlikely a good-fit for this role.</li>\n  <li><strong>Are proficient in HTML &amp; CSS</strong>&nbsp;(any other coding languages are an asset) – Similar to the above, marketing today relies heavily on technology and automation. You don’t need any formal development experience but if you’re not comfortable with at least HTML &amp; CSS, please don’t apply. Similarly, if you’re not the kind of person that loves testing out new tools and technology, this position is not a good fit.</li>\n  <li><strong>Excel at written and spoken English</strong>&nbsp;– Being able to write well is a must for any Trialfacts position. Being in a remote team, you must also be great at communicating and comfortable sharing your thoughts – whether it be in Slack or during a team meeting on Zoom. At times you will even use screen share software (like Loom) to explain a concept or provide feedback.</li>\n  <li><strong>Are results-driven&nbsp;</strong>– you will be coached and guided, but ultimately you will be responsible for your performance which will directly impact your compensation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Are looking for a full-time position</strong>&nbsp;– we’re experiencing growth and we need someone who can fully commit to Trialfacts and get up to speed fairly quickly. We’re not looking for someone who wants to run their own part-time business or freelancing career on the side.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Here’s how to apply:</strong></p>\n <p>If you’re interested in this position, then please email us at&nbsp;<strong>applications@trialfacts.com</strong>&nbsp;with the subject “Paid Advertising Specialist Application – [Your Name]” and tell us why we should consider you. Please also let us know how you heard about this position, and include in your application your current career goals and why you would like this position. Please also address where you think you’ll be located.&nbsp;<strong>Make sure you follow the instructions.</strong></p>\n <p>Please note, you may find the application process differs a little from what you might expect. Although there will be phone interviews, an interview alone is a poor way to assess a candidate, so we’ll also be asking you to complete a few short tasks. These tasks are quick and designed to be fun and informative, but also to assess something about you. After each task we will let you know if you were successful in proceeding to the next round. If all goes well we’ll ask you to undertake a paid trial to see if there is a good fit, before making a final decision.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://trialfacts.com/paid-advertising-specialist' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;\n  <em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases, results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  See how our clients&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we've received</a>&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/blog/holiday-collaboration-with-velodrome-coffee/' rel='nofollow'>holiday gifts</a>&nbsp;each year. Or, if you're a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/seaworthy/' rel='nofollow'>Seaworthy</a>, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4><span>A Day In The Life</span></h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;\n  <a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4><span>What Does Success Look Like?</span></h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll receive extensive on the job training including a customized trail of technical assessments and assignments. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You'll have dedicated pairing time scheduled with various colleagues to cover different skills, and we'll even participate in several mock client meetings so your first standup or sprint planning meeting doesn't carry with it the weight of your first client interaction. After this training period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;\n  <span><em>Welcome aboard!</em></span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>Ongoing Support</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful.

We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We're here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4><span>Experience and Results At Every Level</span></h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019.
