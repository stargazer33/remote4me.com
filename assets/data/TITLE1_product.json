    "content": "At PassFort, we share a powerful vision to enable businesses & individuals to establish trust online. <br /><br />We currently do this by giving businesses the tools they need to automate and digitalise the onboarding, verification and management of their customers - that means customers can be onboarded in real-time, without ever having met in person. <br /><br />And this is just the beginning - our technology allows us to define what ‘trust’ means across the digital economy. Our long term aim is to create a single network where people and businesses can share their digital identity securely and interchangeably - whether they’re applying for a mortgage, listing on the stock market, or applying for a new job. We're transforming how trust is established online, in the same way that Salesforce transformed sales, Stripe transformed payments and AWS transformed DevOps.<br /><br />What you’ll be doing<br /><br />We’re looking for a Growth Marketer ready to bring their skills into an ambitious and fast-growing startup.

As someone driven by data, the acquisition funnel you create and optimise will be the foundation of our Growth Engine. We see SEO and PPC initiatives as a big initial investment to building out a category defining brand. <br /><br />However we don’t want you to stop there. We also see this as a great developmental opportunity - we’re looking for you to grow with the business, so you’ll thrive on researching and experimenting with new channels to help pinpoint where we should focus our budget. <br /><br />What we’re looking for<br /><br />* Independent and organised self starter not afraid of meeting challenges head on<br />* You’ll be metrics focussed, able to track conversion rates and ROI, and make data driven decisions<br />* Love A/B testing anything you can think of;<br />* In-depth knowledge of SEO and Adwords<br />* Experienced using Google Analytics<br />* Experience of B2B marketing<br />* Experience with Google Tag Manager a plus<br />* Knowledge of other marketing channels and social a plus<br />* Experience working within or with small businesses / start-ups a plus<br /><br />The Perks<br /><br />* Equity!

And getting stuff DONE? Then we might love you! We’re seeking an awesome remote marketing assistant to join our small team in this full-time contract position.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>About You</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Any of this sound like you? You might be a great fit.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You love getting stuff done - a day where you check 10 items off your to-do list sounds like a great day to you! You are incredibly skilled at getting what needs to be done done and are not afraid to ask questions along the way.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Organizational messes are eye-twitch-inducing for you and color-coded tabs &amp; dividers are the things of dreams. You are incredibly detail-oriented &amp; organized. Details feel like a natural focus for you. Spreadsheets? Yes, please!</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>On-time to you means 5 minutes early - and late isn’t even part of your vocabulary. Your word is your word and deadlines are your BFF. Sticking to deadlines has never been a problem for you because you are incredibly self-aware with how much you can take on and would never commit to an unrealistic timeline. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re also not afraid to push back against what you know is a very unrealistic deadline. Sticking to your word of completing a task when you say you will is way more important to you than trying to make promises that you can’t or will struggle to keep.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re incredibly polite but direct in your communication. You’re the kind of person who always gets a refund over the phone when you (politely) push for it. Kill ‘em with kindness might as well be stitched on every pillow you own. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You do NOT thrive on being micromanaged and love to be given the freedom to excel in your job. Being your own boss within an organization is a dream come true for you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re by no means a techie developer or computer engineer but you’re a quick learner and consider yourself to be very comfortable with technology. You know how to turn to The Google when you’re stuck with something - whether that’s troubleshooting a Skype connection issue for a meeting (or your friend’s frozen phone) or researching what tool or specific kind of help we might need with a website or other online project.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Basically, you’re like a toddler with an iPad - after a little bit of messing around with a new tool, you just kinda get it. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You are open, direct, and straightforward. You believe that honesty, awareness, and ownership are the direct routes to problem solving. You’d rather not play the “blame game,” but instead just correct the issue and keep moving! You are a solution-based thinker who investigates why things went wrong with the goal of improving the process. You believe that a process problem lies at the root of every apparent people problem.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>It is pretty impossible to faze you and you’re able to take a hit and keep rolling — your goal is to get it done, even if the path that gets there isn’t quite the one that you anticipated!</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Other Requirements:</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>So what do you really NEED to be a good fit for this job? If you’ve read this far and are saying yes, yes, yes! Then you’re probably already a good fit! </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here are just a few other things you should have to be able to hit the ground running:</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><ul><li>a computer with a webcam (team meetings via video make the remote team wheels go ‘round) and a high-speed internet connection<br></li><li>experience working in an administrative, marketing or research support role<br></li><li>computer-savvy-ness<br></li><li>availability to work in Eastern time ~ 8am-4pm EST (once we’ve hit our groove, specific hours will matter less as long as we overlap when we need to)<br></li><li>comfort with the geek-speak. Our team of 9 includes 8 developers and our customers are web developers. You don’t have to know how to code yourself but you have to be comfortable navigating code-heavy conversation.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>Nice-to-Have</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Experience with marketing automation software<br></li><li>Simple graphic design skills<br></li><li>Bachelor's degree or equivalent</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>But This Role Is NOT For You If…</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You struggle to stick with systems or find organizing virtual document messes to be overwhelming or the sort of task you push off for forever because you just aren’t that into it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You don’t enjoy learning new technologies and often find yourself frustrated when trying to pick up the gist of how a new piece of software works and would rather just do things the way you already know how to do.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You want no part of interacting directly with customers (about 6-8 hours of your week will include processing refund requests and answering simple pre-sales questions in support).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your idea of researching a question or opportunity is Googling a single phrase and if you can’t find what you’re looking for on the first page of results, you don’t know where to turn next so you decide the answer doesn’t exist.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You find it hard to always keep to deadlines, or find yourself always running to meetings 5 minutes late.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re afraid to bring up the idea that you might not hit a deadline as promised so you just ignore it and hope no one notices. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You prefer a very hands-on management style - you find having some direct you on a daily basis is how you get your best work done. Days where you don’t have someone checking in with you are days you really don’t get much done at all. It’s a daily struggle for you to stay motivated and focused.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You need a lot of reminders to actually follow-through on a project.</span></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><b>About This Role</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Um, so what will you be doing exactly?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You will be the go-to marketing task-master at Delicious Brains Inc. You’ll be the force behind actually moving all of our projects forward because you’ll be moving stuff from “we need” to “done-so!”. You’ll work with our team to identify marketing priorities and get our projects done on time. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re the go-to person for getting stuff DONE. You are excellent at details &amp; research, from spotting an inconsistency in a spreadsheet to knowing exactly how to manipulate the Google to find the answers you need. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>No day is the same but an example day might include pulling metrics from our SEO software to help prioritize content optimization &amp; development, responding to simple prospective customer queries about our products, implementing the next round of experiments to our PPC campaigns, scheduling a series of social media posts for an upcoming marketing event, drafting a new opt-in embed with one of our drag-and-drop builder tools, checking on the status of an upcoming blog post written by one of our developers.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Basically, you’re the one who keeps our “to-do” list short and our “done” list long every day. You keep our team happy and our projects on time. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are a virtual office — that means everyone (including you!) works from your own home office, favorite coffee shop, co-working space, etc. This means you get all the best parts of interacting with a super fun team, with none of the commute and cubicles. Although your day-to-day will involve working closely with our small team, you need to be the kind of person that enjoys working from home and managing their own time.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Some of your tasks may include:</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>translating big ideas into projects, deliverables, &amp; timelines<br></li><li>assisting with documenting our systems &amp; keeping systems and project plans up-to-date as things change and evolve<br></li><li>conducting research to find resources for the team when needed - whether that’s people or tools<br></li><li>answering pre-sale and billing questions from prospective customers and processing refund requests<br></li><li>formatting &amp; scheduling our email newsletters and blog posts<br></li><li>organizing our Google Drive files<br></li><li>creating and managing spreadsheets<br></li><li>scheduling social media updates<br></li><li>creating simple social media graphics<br></li><li>managing our affiliate system<br></li><li>implementing team-crafted marketing campaigns in Adwords, Facebook, Drip, etc.<br></li><li>executing simple landing pages &amp; calls-to-action with tools like LeadPages, ConvertFlow or similar as directed by the Marketing Manager</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>Benefits</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>What’s an attractive benefits package? Well, it really depends on the person. What do you value?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Maybe a competitive salary is what you’re after. Or maybe you really value vacation time and would rather less pay and more vacation days. Maybe health coverage is important to you, or maybe you’re already covered.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Because everyone values things differently, I’m leaving this wide open. Carte blanche. I’m certain we can work out an arrangement you’ll be happy with.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here are some of the benefits everyone gets:</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><i>Parental Leave</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>For the birth or adoption of a child, DBI offers 100% paid leave of 8 weeks for primary caregivers and 3 weeks leave for secondary caregivers. Contractors may choose to take an additional 8 weeks unpaid leave and Canadian employees may choose to take unpaid leave in accordance with the employment laws of their province.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><i>Location Independent</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Although six of your work hours need to overlap with the Marketing Manager’s in the beginning (as mentioned above), we can do with less overlap once we’ve worked together for a while. You’ll be free to work from nearly anywhere in the world, wherever you’re happiest. Our team is currently distributed across the globe, working from our homes in Nova Scotia, Ontario, California, Pennsylvania, Scotland, and England.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><i>Company Retreats</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>The entire team was flown into Jamaica for the annual company retreat in May 2018. Previous destinations have included Halifax, Miami and Vienna. Food/drink, travel, and accommodation were covered. Check out the blog post (https://deliciousbrains.com/nova-scotia-third-annual-retreat/) for the details. Where will we go in 2019!?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><i>You Choose Your Schedule</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>What’s your ideal schedule? Maybe you like the regular 9am-5pm schedule. Or maybe a 4-day work week is your thing. Or maybe you prefer to work 6-days per week, but less each day. Or maybe it changes week-to-week.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>It really doesn’t matter as long as we overlap by six hours most days in the beginning and after a while it will be completely up to you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Application Details</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>This is a full-time position, which means you’re expected to work 32-37.5 hours per week. You’ll be working independently from your own home.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span></span></div><div><span><b>About Our Company</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re Delicious Brains Inc. We make awesome stuff for WordPress developers including:</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>WP Migrate DB Pro - our flagship product that lets you copy your database from one WordPress install to another with one click in your dashboard.

We’re seeking an awesome remote marketing assistant to join our small team in this full-time contract position.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>About You</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Any of this sound like you? You might be a great fit.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You love getting stuff done - a day where you check 10 items off your to-do list sounds like a great day to you! You are incredibly skilled at getting what needs to be done done and are not afraid to ask questions along the way.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Organizational messes are eye-twitch-inducing for you and color-coded tabs &amp; dividers are the things of dreams. You are incredibly detail-oriented &amp; organized. Details feel like a natural focus for you. Spreadsheets? Yes, please!</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>On-time to you means 5 minutes early - and late isn’t even part of your vocabulary. Your word is your word and deadlines are your BFF. Sticking to deadlines has never been a problem for you because you are incredibly self-aware with how much you can take on and would never commit to an unrealistic timeline. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re also not afraid to push back against what you know is a very unrealistic deadline. Sticking to your word of completing a task when you say you will is way more important to you than trying to make promises that you can’t or will struggle to keep.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re incredibly polite but direct in your communication. You’re the kind of person who always gets a refund over the phone when you (politely) push for it. Kill ‘em with kindness might as well be stitched on every pillow you own. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You do NOT thrive on being micromanaged and love to be given the freedom to excel in your job. Being your own boss within an organization is a dream come true for you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re by no means a techie developer or computer engineer but you’re a quick learner and consider yourself to be very comfortable with technology. You know how to turn to The Google when you’re stuck with something - whether that’s troubleshooting a Skype connection issue for a meeting (or your friend’s frozen phone) or researching what tool or specific kind of help we might need with a website or other online project.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Basically, you’re like a toddler with an iPad - after a little bit of messing around with a new tool, you just kinda get it. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You are open, direct, and straightforward. You believe that honesty, awareness, and ownership are the direct routes to problem solving. You’d rather not play the “blame game,” but instead just correct the issue and keep moving! You are a solution-based thinker who investigates why things went wrong with the goal of improving the process. You believe that a process problem lies at the root of every apparent people problem.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>It is pretty impossible to faze you and you’re able to take a hit and keep rolling — your goal is to get it done, even if the path that gets there isn’t quite the one that you anticipated!</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Other Requirements:</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>So what do you really NEED to be a good fit for this job? If you’ve read this far and are saying yes, yes, yes! Then you’re probably already a good fit! </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here are just a few other things you should have to be able to hit the ground running:</span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><ul><li>a computer with a webcam (team meetings via video make the remote team wheels go ‘round) and a high-speed internet connection<br></li><li>experience working in an administrative, marketing or research support role<br></li><li>computer-savvy-ness<br></li><li>availability to work in Eastern time ~ 8am-4pm EST (once we’ve hit our groove, specific hours will matter less as long as we overlap when we need to)<br></li><li>comfort with the geek-speak. Our team of 9 includes 8 developers and our customers are web developers. You don’t have to know how to code yourself but you have to be comfortable navigating code-heavy conversation.&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>Nice-to-Have</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Experience with marketing automation software<br></li><li>Simple graphic design skills<br></li><li>Bachelor's degree or equivalent</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>But This Role Is NOT For You If…</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You struggle to stick with systems or find organizing virtual document messes to be overwhelming or the sort of task you push off for forever because you just aren’t that into it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You don’t enjoy learning new technologies and often find yourself frustrated when trying to pick up the gist of how a new piece of software works and would rather just do things the way you already know how to do.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You want no part of interacting directly with customers (about 6-8 hours of your week will include processing refund requests and answering simple pre-sales questions in support).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your idea of researching a question or opportunity is Googling a single phrase and if you can’t find what you’re looking for on the first page of results, you don’t know where to turn next so you decide the answer doesn’t exist.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You find it hard to always keep to deadlines, or find yourself always running to meetings 5 minutes late.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re afraid to bring up the idea that you might not hit a deadline as promised so you just ignore it and hope no one notices. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You prefer a very hands-on management style - you find having some direct you on a daily basis is how you get your best work done. Days where you don’t have someone checking in with you are days you really don’t get much done at all. It’s a daily struggle for you to stay motivated and focused.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You need a lot of reminders to actually follow-through on a project.</span></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><b>About This Role</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Um, so what will you be doing exactly?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You will be the go-to marketing task-master at Delicious Brains Inc. You’ll be the force behind actually moving all of our projects forward because you’ll be moving stuff from “we need” to “done-so!”. You’ll work with our team to identify marketing priorities and get our projects done on time. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re the go-to person for getting stuff DONE. You are excellent at details &amp; research, from spotting an inconsistency in a spreadsheet to knowing exactly how to manipulate the Google to find the answers you need. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>No day is the same but an example day might include pulling metrics from our SEO software to help prioritize content optimization &amp; development, responding to simple prospective customer queries about our products, implementing the next round of experiments to our PPC campaigns, scheduling a series of social media posts for an upcoming marketing event, drafting a new opt-in embed with one of our drag-and-drop builder tools, checking on the status of an upcoming blog post written by one of our developers.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Basically, you’re the one who keeps our “to-do” list short and our “done” list long every day. You keep our team happy and our projects on time. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are a virtual office — that means everyone (including you!) works from your own home office, favorite coffee shop, co-working space, etc. This means you get all the best parts of interacting with a super fun team, with none of the commute and cubicles. Although your day-to-day will involve working closely with our small team, you need to be the kind of person that enjoys working from home and managing their own time.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Some of your tasks may include:</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>translating big ideas into projects, deliverables, &amp; timelines<br></li><li>assisting with documenting our systems &amp; keeping systems and project plans up-to-date as things change and evolve<br></li><li>conducting research to find resources for the team when needed - whether that’s people or tools<br></li><li>answering pre-sale and billing questions from prospective customers and processing refund requests<br></li><li>formatting &amp; scheduling our email newsletters and blog posts<br></li><li>organizing our Google Drive files<br></li><li>creating and managing spreadsheets<br></li><li>scheduling social media updates<br></li><li>creating simple social media graphics<br></li><li>managing our affiliate system<br></li><li>implementing team-crafted marketing campaigns in Adwords, Facebook, Drip, etc.<br></li><li>executing simple landing pages &amp; calls-to-action with tools like LeadPages, ConvertFlow or similar as directed by the Marketing Manager</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>Benefits</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>What’s an attractive benefits package? Well, it really depends on the person. What do you value?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Maybe a competitive salary is what you’re after. Or maybe you really value vacation time and would rather less pay and more vacation days. Maybe health coverage is important to you, or maybe you’re already covered.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Because everyone values things differently, I’m leaving this wide open. Carte blanche. I’m certain we can work out an arrangement you’ll be happy with.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here are some of the benefits everyone gets:</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><i>Parental Leave</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>For the birth or adoption of a child, DBI offers 100% paid leave of 8 weeks for primary caregivers and 3 weeks leave for secondary caregivers. Contractors may choose to take an additional 8 weeks unpaid leave and Canadian employees may choose to take unpaid leave in accordance with the employment laws of their province.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><i>Location Independent</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Although six of your work hours need to overlap with the Marketing Manager’s in the beginning (as mentioned above), we can do with less overlap once we’ve worked together for a while. You’ll be free to work from nearly anywhere in the world, wherever you’re happiest. Our team is currently distributed across the globe, working from our homes in Nova Scotia, Ontario, California, Pennsylvania, Scotland, and England.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><i>Company Retreats</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>The entire team was flown into Jamaica for the annual company retreat in May 2018. Previous destinations have included Halifax, Miami and Vienna. Food/drink, travel, and accommodation were covered. Check out the blog post (https://deliciousbrains.com/nova-scotia-third-annual-retreat/) for the details. Where will we go in 2019!?</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><i>You Choose Your Schedule</i></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>What’s your ideal schedule? Maybe you like the regular 9am-5pm schedule. Or maybe a 4-day work week is your thing. Or maybe you prefer to work 6-days per week, but less each day. Or maybe it changes week-to-week.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>It really doesn’t matter as long as we overlap by six hours most days in the beginning and after a while it will be completely up to you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Application Details</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>This is a full-time position, which means you’re expected to work 32-37.5 hours per week. You’ll be working independently from your own home.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span></span></div><div><span><b>About Our Company</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re Delicious Brains Inc. We make awesome stuff for WordPress developers including:</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>WP Migrate DB Pro - our flagship product that lets you copy your database from one WordPress install to another with one click in your dashboard. Yep, it’s that easy. If you find yourself needing to migrate databases, our customers call this one a “no-brainer.”</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>WP Offload S3 - our plugin that lets you serve your media and assets from S3, CloudFront or your personal favorite CDN. Cue site speed benefits.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re also working on a new WordPress plugin and a new SaaS app, both launching later this year.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>P.S. Wondering about the name Delicious Brains? Funny story. It’s a Simpsons reference. Pretty obscure, but Homer utters it in a zombie episode. Have you seen it? And yes, we’ve spent a lot of time debating Z-Day strategies on company retreats :)</span><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Fill out this application: <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/marketing-assistant/' rel='nofollow'>https://deliciousbrains.com/marketing-assistant/</a></p>  </div>"

Rather than working for a mega-corp, you will be working in a company where your work has real impact in the fun, high-growth stages of our evolution.</p><p>We are looking for security analysts to join our forensics team. You will assist our customers to investigate how their site was hacked and to repair their site and remove all traces of the intrusion. In addition to this you will also collect evidence from intrusions that will help improve our threat detection. You will need to determine how the intrusion occurred and then collect all IOC’s (indicators of compromise) and share this data with our product team in a structured way.</p><p>General requirements:</p><p>● You must be highly technical and be comfortable with a wide range of open source tools.</p><p>● Excellent written and verbal communication skills.</p><p>● You must work well in a team.</p><p>● You must be nimble, be able to come up with creative solutions to challenging problems and must have a mature approach to problem solving.</p><p>● Attention to detail.</p><p>Note: Applicants who can work weekends will be given priority consideration.</p><p>We have the highest star rating for any WordPress plugin in history and we pride ourselves on providing an excellent product with great customer service that helps secure small and large production websites. If you're passionate about information security and would like to help secure the web, this is your dream job. We take our team's family time seriously and don't ask you to work long hours if we can avoid it (we almost always can). Our entire team works remotely using Slack for casual interaction ­so you can live practically anywhere in the world as long as you have an internet connection. Wordfence is high growth, but we are not a startup. The company is still controlled by the founders, we are profitable and have been for many years. So you will enjoy the rush of high growth but you won't have to risk working for a company that is controlled by venture capitalists or may not be here tomorrow.</p>                                                                                                                                        <a href='https://defiant.workable.com/j/806EFFE4AE' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a>                                                                                About Defiant Inc            <p>At Defiant, ‘trust’ is the attribute we value most highly among our team members. We need to know that you can grab a task from a support ticketing system, communicate clearly with our customers and see the task to completion with excellent attention to detail. We don’t micro­manage and we trust that you will be able to see tasks through to completion and communicate with your fellow team members when needed or ask for help when needed. You will be working for a company that has code protecting over 2 million production websites.

    "content": "SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE <br /><br />OLIO is the world’s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and our mission is to solve the problem of food waste in the home & local community. We do this by connecting anyone with spare food – which can be households or local businesses – with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away £800 of food each year - collectively adding up to £15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile & web apps.  <br /><br />Over the past 2 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. We now have over 465,000 users who have together shared well over half a million portions of food – with food being successfully shared in 32 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our volunteer programme, with over 19,000 people reaching out to spread the word about OLIO in their local community and rescue unsold food. OLIO is now looking to grow our core team as we embark upon the next exciting phase in our journey.  <br /><br />JOIN OUR TEAM! <br /><br />In order to accelerate OLIO to its next level in growth and impact, we are recruiting for an Analytics & Growth Associate, who will report into Viv Taylor, Product Manager.  <br /><br />In this role you will be responsible for: <br /><br />- Analysing data for the business via MySQLPhp and ensure the right questions are being asked and prioritise the sequence in which they are asked <br />- Developing an expert understanding of our how our data is structured and what insights can be derived from it <br />- Creating ad-hoc reports to evaluate the efficacy of specific initiatives/experiments <br />- Running regular reports that provide insight into ongoing company/departmental performance <br />- Creating a company dashboard(s) <br />- Assisting in online ad creative, implementation and analysis <br /><br />Once you have proven yourself you will have great freedom and autonomy, coupled with an enormous opportunity for personal development.

We live for our mission, but like to have fun along the way! <br /><br />IS THIS YOU? <br /><br />Our ideal candidate will first and foremost be as passionate about our mission as we are! In addition to this, you will have the following experience and skills: <br /><br />- Previous experience in a similar role , ideally in a fast-paced environment <br />- Know what it means for results to be “statistically significant” and how to derive such results <br />- Significant experience with SQL <br />- Significant experience with Excel <br />- Excitement about productivity tools, spreadsheets, and databases <br />- Photoshop experience <br />- Curiosity about and enthusiasm for systems and processes <br />- A good balance between analytical abilities and creativity <br />- Scrappy and resourceful when facing challenges of all types  <br />- An eye for detail <br /><br /><br />*Bonus points:* <br /><br />- You have experience working for a high-growth startup <br />- You have experience in CRM, Mixpanel, Google Adwords, and Facebook Ads Manager   <br /><br />And all OLIO team members share these attributes: <br /><br />- A self-starter with a ‘can-do’ attitude <br />- Resourceful and creative <br />- Thorough, but able to move quickly and decisively <br />- A ruthless ability to prioritise <br />- Excellent communication skills <br />- Fun to work with"

If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. Also, we work remotely (we all work from where we live). </p><p>&quot;Hashtags! Yay!&quot;</p><p>NO!!! </p><p>That's not actually what we're about. We build a suite of SaaS products for people and companies that expect social ROI: they need to get something back when they share to social.</p><p>RiteForge and RiteBoost do total social media optimization: images, custom visuals, link ads - and data-driven auto-hashtagging as well. For those who need to get business, sign-ups, or sales from what they share in Facebook, Twitter and beyond, RiteForge automates image creation and extraction, adds a call-to-action header to pages shared socially, and uses text analysis and machine learning to aid with hashtags as well.  </p><p>What is RiteKit?<br>The initial concept for RiteTag, our first product, was borne of the aftermath of the 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. After witnessing the flurry of disorganized social media activity, our CEO and Founder wanted to help people get their social content discovered in an increasing noisy world.<br>What SEO does for web pages, SMO (social media optimization) does for video uploads, sound files, Facebook updates, Tweets... and it is much more than hashtags that does this. Today we continue to build tools to further our original mission to increase the customer's social media presence.</p><p>We build data-driven social media engagement SaaS products.

(Best case scenario: after this internship you either launch your own startup, join one as a co-founder, or become so important to us that you create a position for yourself on our team.)<br>• Forge alliances with people at companies and startups that should be using our APIs and/or SaaS products<br>• Engage our growing community in Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Medium and beyond.<br>• Write case study articles for our blogs.<br>• Do what it takes to get original articles on getting things done with RiteKit in major news sites and top-tier blogs.<br>• Learn how to win at marketing</p><p>Terms &amp; Requirements:<br>• Ability to learn and teach RiteKit products and coach a business owner to use them so that they get social ROI. This will be your entry exam and how you will qualify for the internship.<br>• Ability to collaborate in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>• Commitment: 6 months at 3-5 hours/week OR 12 months at 2~3 hours/week (decide later, no rush)<br>• Be okay with the internship being UNPAID. <br>• Must be well-written and have proven ability to create visual content<br>• No relocation needed; we work remotely</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers. </p><p>As a self funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends that have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time.</p></div>"

    "content": "*About Us*<br /><br />Do you want to build an exciting new brand in an industry ripe for a makeover?<br /><br />Join us on our mission.<br /><br />At Laka, we believe that traditional insurance fails to offer peace of mind. It’s an inconvenience people have to deal with – unpleasant, expensive and unfair.<br /><br />Laka has a new way to protect your favourite things in the world.<br /><br />What makes us truly different is that members of our community don’t pay a fixed premium every year, but only share the true cost of claims incurred by the community. Simple, but truly disruptive (Sorry for the D-word).<br /><br />The first thing we have chosen to insure are high-end bicycles. For that, we have assembled a community of real cyclists who protect each other's bikes against whatever happens.<br /><br />Every month Laka helps community members in need - when their gear is damaged or stolen. At the end of the month all costs are split between the community, but each member’s premium is capped at market rate. Instead of paying hefty margins, our customers know they will always get the best price for great cover.<br /><br />Insurance that just works.<br /><br />We went from concept to regulated business with a live product in 12 months. On the way, we joined fantastic ecosystems such as Anthemis’ Fellowship program and Startupbootcamp InsurTech, gathering a stellar host of business angels around us.<br /><br />You can be an integral part of the brilliant team taking the business from hundreds to thousands of customers. With our revolutionary approach to insurance, we have the opportunity to relentlessly challenge the status quo in insurance and build a brand which truly reflects our mission.<br /><br />We’re currently a team of 7, so everyone is vitally important to our success. You’ll be working directly with the company founders and will get to experience life in a startup company as we scale! We encourage you to get involved with any aspect of the business you are interested in. T-shaped people are the best!<br /><br />Our office is in Oxford Circus, but we are flexible and understand sometimes you just need to work from home or wherever inspires you the most.<br /><br />The specifics (including the final title) of the role will vary depending on your experience, but in any case, it will grow with you. We want bright people to join us on our journey.<br /><br /><br />*About You*<br /><br />You need to be prepared to hit the ground running, have an interest in learning new things, and be comfortable working in a (constantly!) changing environment. We are looking for someone who can relentlessly execute without losing sight of what really moves the needle.<br /><br />You love to craft engaging copy, create content and own the creative side of marketing. Help us shape the voice of Laka and communicate with customers effectively to create a kick-ass brand.<br /><br />When not flexing your creative muscle, you thrive on engaging with people (preferably cyclists). Running pop-ups, preparing trade fairs & races, collaborating with athletes and cycling teams will be just as important as the work behind your desk.<br /><br />Both are vital to building a strong consumer brand and a tight-knit community of cyclists.<br /><br />You know your channels and understand what tools to use, from organic to social and affiliate/referral driven acquisition.
