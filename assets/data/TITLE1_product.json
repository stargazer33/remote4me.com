Also, for the question about localizing the website to German, just put that you read the entire application.</li><li>Work with the German Immigration Lead to write documentation on the German Immigration process for content or future hires.</li><li>Analyze the performance of our Facebook Ads campaigns, and optimize for the best performing audience segments.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If all that sounds exciting, let’s keep going.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About you</strong></h3><div>You must have a strong entrepreneurial spirit, and you should’ve spent the last couple of years driving growth and sales at a small team, wearing multiple hats.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You could be an ex-startup founder, part of a startup’s founding team, or part of a Launch Team in a big company (think Rocket Internet, Uber, Deliveroo, Bolt, etc.)</div><div><br></div><div>You need to work independently, and be able to hit goals. Your <em>only</em> responsibility will be to work alongside our German Immigration Lead and drive new customers in our German operations.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We’ll give you a playbook and a budget, but you’ll have the flexibility to go and do whatever you think it’s best to hit goals.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This means you’ll need a strategic vision, but on-the-ground execution and <em>some </em>combination of the following skills: personalized cold outreach at scale, sales, paid advertising, content marketing, SEO, copywriting, or marketing ops.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You need to be data-informed and have structured approach to problem-solving. We don’t care about A/B testing (<em>just yet</em>) but you do need to figure out what works and what doesn’t in Germany.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the Growth Team is distributed around the world, you should have very strong communication and organizational skills. Remote working experience is a bonus, but if you’ve never worked from home, that’s fine too. Finally, you should be fluent in German and English.</div><div><br></div><div>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. We are already a diverse bunch, but each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>Who you’ll be working with (and from where)</strong></h3><div>You’ll work primarily with (and report to) <strong>Gonz</strong>, our Head of Growth, to plan out growth efforts. He is based in Barcelona, but travels quite a bit.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll also work with Maria, our Content Strategist, and Angie, our SDR. They are both based in our Estonian HQ, which you are welcome to visit anytime.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, you’ll be working hand-by-hand with our Immigration Lead in Germany. He is based in Munich, and just joined our team. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As our German Growth Country Manager, you’ll be (ideally) based in Germany but as long as you speak German fluently and are familiar with business practices over there, we're good. Some travel to Germany might be required.</div><div><br></div><h3><strong>About the pay and benefits</strong></h3><ul><li>Great compensation. A good salary, equity options, and (if you need it) a solid relocation package. Obviously.</li><li>Self-care budget. A budget for books, gym, and Uber rides for when you want to treat yourself to a night out.</li><li>Tools for the job. A computer, monitor, headphones, and other hardware you might need to work comfortably.</li><li>Time for yourself. 28 days of paid vacation, 3 mental health days a year, and generous parental leave.</li><li>Flexible Work. Work from home or in our spacious office in the coolest part of town.</li><li>Annual offsite in Tallinn. Karaoke included.</li></ul></div>",

We need you to not be shy about keeping others — even our CEO — to a schedule. If you need a lot of hand holding, you won’t be a great fit for this role.&nbsp;<br><br>It’s also not a content creation role — we’re using existing content that Matthew creates, and someone else will be delivering that weekly. Your process management, organizational, and teamwork skills, as well as your flexibility, will be more important than anything in this role.</div><div><br></div><div>The qualities we’re looking for include:</div><div><br></div><div>– High level of organizational skills and ability to organize others</div><div>– Process mindset and ability to see the big picture from a linear, process-driven perspective and organize others within that</div><div>– Confidence, but no ego</div><div>– Ability to keep others on schedule, no fear in your project management skillset</div><div>– Lots of flexibility&nbsp;</div><div>– High digital availability and willingness to grow with us</div><div>– Passion for and devotion to the work we do and our community</div><div>– Dependability</div><div>– Prior experience as a freelancer preferred</div><div>– Two years of social media management experience preferred (bonus points if it’s for a media personality)</div><div><br></div><div>Responsibilities include:</div><div><br></div><div>– Process managing two designers, a video editor, and our CEO to get posts planned, ready, and scheduled (we have someone else who will source &amp; deliver content from our existing library)</div><div>– Finalizing approvals from Matthew&nbsp;</div><div>– Scheduling daily posts and tweets</div><div>– Creating a social media content schedule every month&nbsp;</div><div>– Helping put in place a team to review comments and respond to messages with questions about our programs</div><div>– Willingness to speak up with ideas as well as take final direction where necessary</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Why Join Us?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>You’ll work remotely with a good amount of flexibility. We are 100% remote, with team members based in LA, NY, the UK, Eastern Europe, and Asia.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Make an impact – help women level-up in their relationships, self-esteem, and happiness.</div><div><br></div><div>Be part of a positive, upbeat team that deals with each other with respect and gratitude.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>HOURS</strong></div><div><br></div><div>This role starts as part-time freelance for 20 hours per week, but we are looking for someone who wants to be full time and expect the hours to grow rapidly. Given that most of our customers are in the U.S., we generally work U.S. business hours, so you should have consistent availability within 9 am - 6 pm Eastern time hours (if you’re an early bird and want to work from Pacific Time, or a night owl who wants to work from European hours, we don’t care, but we’ll need to be reliably able to reach you during these hours). You’ll need consistent availability for team video calls between the hours of 11 AM - 3 PM Eastern.</div><div><br></div><div>To be considered, please write a cover letter to recruiting@howtogettheguy.com as to why you’d be a good fit in the body of your email. DO NOT send a CV or other attachments (if you attach ANYTHING to it, your application will automatically not be read). We prioritize culture fit, attention to detail, and superstar-quality writing when selecting candidates.&nbsp;<br><br>You’ll be interviewing with our Customer Support Lead, Courtney. Her favorite color is red, so she’d be pleased if you put that word somewhere in your subject line when sending your letter.</div><div><br></div><div>Looking forward to meeting you!</div></div>",

Our goal is to ultimately re-imagine the way building projects are planned, delivered and operated.</p><br /><p>Over the past year, our three offices (London - HQ, Sarajevo, and Yerevan) have joined forces to build a product and service that our customers love. Now, we&rsquo;re kickstarting our growth across the pond in New York with our newest clients, Tiffany &amp; Co and Aecom Tishman.</p><br /><p>We have ambitions to expand significantly, which means that we are looking for passionate and enthusiastic talent to join our&nbsp;<a class=&quot;external&quot; href='https://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.disperse.io%2Fteam%2F' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>proudly diverse, international team</a>.</p><br /><h3>YOUR ROLE</h3><br /><p>There is no better time to join our growing team, as you will have the rare opportunity to establish yourself as first Product Marketing leader and a core part of our US founding team in New York. The idea is to build out a team that connects the dots between a fantastic product and huge growth potential. Productivity in construction is an age-old problem with enormous opportunity and we&rsquo;re looking for someone ambitious, smart and versatile to help us unlock it. As we expand domestically and globally, the Product Marketing team has a critical role in supporting and enabling our growth.</p><br /><p>We organise the Product Marketing team into two parts, focusing on different core outcomes:</p><br /><p><em>Product Success: Customers understand the problems we solve and the value they get from our products and solutions.</em></p><br /><p><em>Commercial Success: ensuring that we have clearly differentiated value propositions for key audiences, and that our Sales team and Champions in our customers&rsquo; organisations have the tools they need to position and sell easily.</em></p><br /><p>The role will be based in New York with an initial 6-week on-boarding in London and regular travel to the UK and Europe.</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Lead GTM: Define and lead go-to-market strategy and execution &ndash; Build the launch strategy and lead a cross-functional team to see it through to execution</li><br /><li>Define Positioning: Decide on how we position our product in the market and how we message it strategically to different customer cohorts, buyers and user groups</li><br /><li>Lead product marketing efforts: help define the overall market narrative, construct target customer profiles, generate customer case studies and other collateral to support marketing and sales initiatives, and guide communication efforts across multiple audiences and channels</li><br /><li>Drive inbound product marketing - Be the voice of the market through industry research, competitive analysis, quantitative analysis, and structured qualitative feedback from businesses through direct engagement.</li><br /><li>Content Lead: Set priorities for the content production backlog and drive changes to the marketing website, and ensure the availability of high-quality product collateral; produce high fidelity externally-facing content including thought leadership content, customer stories, webinars, data sheets, solution guides, and more for all funnel stages</li><br /><li>Lead Research: Research key market and product data, conduct user interviews to understand key customer segments, their specific needs, and lifecycle stages</li><br /><li>Sales Enablement: Support the sales team by researching and documenting typical customer use cases and proof points, target buyer profiles, and</li><br /><li>Develop innovative marketing strategies to gain C-level and VP mindshare.</li><br /><li>Champion the product messaging and positioning internally, ensuring not only the commercial side of the business is knowledgeable about product and messaging (everyone represents the Disperse brand)</li><br /></ul><br /><h3>OUR CULTURE</h3><br /><p>Ask anyone at Disperse what they love most about working here, and they'll probably tell you &quot;it's the people!&quot;, &quot;the team, of course&quot;, &quot;the people and the Hedwig owls in the offices&quot;.</p><br /><p>As clich&eacute;d as it may sound, we're very proud of the people we have and the close-knit, family culture we've built across London, Sarajevo and Yerevan. Despite the distances, we're united through the passion with which we approach our goals and the fun that we have along the way. We always look out for each other, no matter what. The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.</li><br /><li>We support each other. If a process breaks or if you're struggling, you can always count on the people around you and the people far away from you, to help you get back on track.</li><br /><li>We run on feedback: direct and transparent praise and constructive criticism, communicated with the best of intentions. There is no other way to learn!</li><br /><li>Ideas and approaches are always judged on merit rather than source. We welcome discussions and challenges. This way everyone makes a tremendous impact no matter the role.</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>REQUIREMENTS</h2><br /><p>Although previous product marketing experience is not an absolute requirement, it certainly helps if you&rsquo;ve positioned and messaged enterprise products before.</p><br /><p>We do not currently sponsor work visas for this role, therefore US citizenship or a green card are required from all applicants.</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have a proven track record of delivering tangible results in a product marketing within a B2B technology organisation</li><br /><li>You have been working as a Product Marketing Manager between 3 to 5 years or have demonstrated experience from a similar field</li><br /><li>You have experience of working collaboratively as part of cross-functional teams to take products to market</li><br /><li>You understand what the component parts are, and how to determine them, for a go-to-market strategy.</li><br /><li>You have led projects to gain insight from customers, and understand how to translate this into useful feedback for Business Development, Marketing and Product teams.</li><br /><li>You have a customer service orientation and experience in a client-facing capacity</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Your skills</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You are able to think critically about why having a great product alone is not enough to succeed</li><br /><li>You are comfortable converting complex concepts into clear, engaging messages for internal and external audiences.</li><br /><li>You enjoy tackling challenging problems to ensure continuous improvement.</li><br /><li>You are action-orientated and enjoy making an impact.</li><br /><li>You are comfortable interpreting data and using it to inform decision making.</li><br /><li>You enjoy driving projects from planning and strategy through to execution and analysis of results.</li><br /><li>You are passionate about technology and its ability to solve complex problems</li><br /></ul><br /></section><br /><section class=&quot;section section--text&quot;><br /><h2 class=&quot;section__header&quot;>BENEFITS</h2><br /><ul><br /><li>Competitive Salary and generous option package</li><br /><li>Private health insurance.</li><br /><li>25 days&rsquo; holiday plus all federal holidays.</li><br /><li>Friendly, open and transparent culture.</li><br /><li>You'll get to join a passionate startup with proven traction on its international scaling journey.</li><br /><li>Flexible working hours / ability to work from home.</li><br /><li>Free coffee.</li><br /><li>Regular travel to the UK and Europe.</li><br /><li>Regular socials, and team retreats to amazing destinations (Tbilisi, Kiev...

You might be the perfect fit for this full-time, remote position if you are an ambitious and highly-skilled sales and marketing manager, who combines creativity with strategy to develop innovative strategies and campaigns to shape the future of our company.<br><br></div><div><br>Aeolidia is a “one stop shop” design agency that develops brands and creates story-centered ecommerce websites for designers, artisans, and curators that have made it past the startup phase.&nbsp; We pair our custom strategic Shopify websites with analytical insights to continually optimize clients’ sites, resulting in significant growth to their online retail sales.<br><br></div><div><br>Our employees are directly responsible for empowering awesome business owners to succeed, and are challenged with meaningful work that improves their particular skills. If this all sounds excellent to you, please keep reading to see if we might be a match to work together!<br><br></div><div><strong><br>A Bit About Us<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Aeolidia is a graphic design and web development agency that has been working with designer and artisan businesses since 2004. We’re the preeminent design team in our creative niche, and we dig deep into strategy based on information we get from each client’s website analytics while also truly understanding the branding part of it. We deliver a gorgeous AND powerful site every time.<br><br></div><div><br>A designer or artist’s story should be compelling to customers. We focus on storytelling for brands. This is about each business’s “why” and what makes them unique and irreplaceable to their perfect customers. Since we do business naming, brand vision and voice, brand graphic identity, copywriting, and photography in-house, we have the capability to craft a cohesive story without losing anything along the way.<br><br></div><div><br>We are a remote team of overachievers, united in our common goal of taking creative businesses to the next level by paving the way toward substantial increases to online sales.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>Now Let’s Talk About You<br></strong><br></div><div><br>As the Sales &amp; Marketing Manager, you’re a critical part of the leadership team. You enjoy leading people, as well as managing the day-to-day sales and marketing operations of a thriving and ever-changing business. You’re creative, charismatic, knowledgeable, and exceptionally well-versed in the latest sales and marketing techniques, as well as tried-and-true practices. You will increase productivity, inspire and motivate junior employees, and optimize our company’s market share.<br><br></div><div><br>Here are just a few ways we see you being successful in the Sales &amp; Marketing Manager role with Aeolidia:<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Diligent Achiever<br></strong><br></div><div><br>You work smartly to deliver a truly top notch experience to your clients. You seek unique solutions, meet each deadline, and just plain get things done. You are a reliable go-getter.<br><br></div><div><br>Capable, persistent, and resourceful, you never despair when you hit a roadblock or need to figure out something new. You give it a try, do the research, try try again, ask for help, test it out, succeed, then consider it a learning experience and a new tool in your kit.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Curious Learner<br></strong><br></div><div><br>You know it would be easy to keep doing what has worked in the past, but you also know that technology changes quickly, each business is different, and what works in one case won’t be the best solution in others.<br><br></div><div><br>You stay abreast of advancements in design, technology, and each specialty area in your role. You value being at the top of your game, even as things change. You have big ideas, and you’re eager to figure out how to do them.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Humble Expert<br></strong><br></div><div><br>It’s important that each member of our team approaches the client relationship from the mindset of a “doctor”—using their years of expertise and insight to prescribe the right solution. This is in sharp contrast to the “waiter” mentality of taking orders and doing what is asked of us.<br><br></div><div><br>You remember that each client knows their business better than you do, and that you have a lot to learn from them. You strike the balance by being authoritative but cooperative and open-minded. You are experienced and your role is to help guide your client down the path to their goal.<br><br></div><div><br>You are highly collaborative and function well within a team. You feel comfortable asking for help and being open about what you don’t yet know. And, in turn, eagerly show up and share the special knowledge you do have without being arrogant about it. You also facilitate a team environment where each member feels the same.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Positive Ally<br></strong><br></div><div><br>You anticipate your clients’ needs and concerns, and take an active role in making them feel comfortable with their brand, their technology, and their next steps.<br><br></div><div><br>When you see a problem you can solve or help with, you leap to action to make progress toward a solution. You take as much responsibility for client dissatisfaction as you can, knowing that you’re the one guiding the relationship and setting expectations.<br><br></div><div><br>You find solutions that are more than just acceptable, but something the client is happy with, and that keeps your relationship with them on a good track.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Creative Supporter<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Your work is meaningful to you. Making a website and getting money is not the satisfying part. You’re in this to watch your clients exceed their goals and feel proud to have contributed.<br><br></div><div><br>You care about and believe in your clients’ businesses. You have a personal connection that makes the journeys of designer and artisan businesses meaningful to you.<br><br></div><div><br>You understand, you relate to, you value and respect each client and their business. With every step on their project, you are aiming to propel your client to where they want to be next.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>A Day in the Life<br></strong><br></div><div><br>Now that we’ve covered what it’s like to work with Aeolidia, let’s chat about what you would be doing on an average day. The full-time Sales &amp; Marketing Manager will work approximately 40 hours per week designing, implementing, and improving sales and marketing strategies. You will be responsible for identifying and targeting new markets, generating new leads, managing the sales and marketing processes, tracking and assessing the effectiveness of each sales and marketing strategy, providing guidance for your team, and removing obstacles and barriers from their path so they can effectively execute the plan.<br><br></div><div><br>As the Sales &amp; Marketing Manager, you will work closely with the CEO/Founder and Director of Operations to ensure the sales and marketing strategies are aligned with the company vision and goals. You will be responsible for translating and communicating the vision and goals to everyone on your team to ensure they understand what is expected of them in their individual roles. You will help drive results by keeping your team focused on the big picture vision and goals, developing team unity, and prioritizing projects so the team can follow through and execute them on schedule. You thrive in the post-project followup (gathering satisfaction surveys, testimonials, case studies, etc.) and understand its role in a successful sales process to attract new clients.<br><br></div><div><br>Every position with Aeolidia is a remote one, meaning you get to work from wherever you are! This also means that you will be leading a remote team. There are no set schedules or hours. Flexible schedules that fit around your life are what we do best. However, of course we do expect all of our team members to meet their goals and project expectations, so we’ll have weekly meetings to check in on progress, celebrate successes and help clear roadblocks that have a tendency to pop up from time to time. In addition to meetings with your supervisor, you’ll also be leading these meetings with your own direct reports, as well as following up on what they have learned from their team members. We want to ensure you (and every team member at Aeolidia) have every chance to be successful in this role and we’re committed to doing our part to make sure you are.<br><br></div><div><strong><br>You’re a Great Fit For Our Team If:<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>You can commit to working 40 hours per week.</li><li>You have a reliable internet connection which allows you to work from anywhere.</li><li>You work closely with the CEO/Founder and Director of Operations to help bring the goals of the company to life through the sales and marketing processes.</li><li>You’re an experienced and confident leader, comfortable with overseeing multiple team members, setting expectations, discussing project goals and outcomes, delegating and handling difficult conversations in a timely manner when they’re needed, all while keeping the company vision in the forefront.</li><li>You’re not someone who settles for the status quo.

This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.<br />Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours. Across the UK, connected communities are simply not happening.<br />This is where School Space comes in.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - How</strong><br />Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays.<br />We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the center of a thriving community.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - Team</strong><br />Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 7 years, and recent success includes investment raises, 29 partner schools, over half a million generated for them. We&rsquo;ve been on the Techstars 2018 Cohort, been nominated for Social Enterprise UK&rsquo;s Social Enterprise of the Year, and picked up a few awards and amazing networks along the way. Our team are committed to the n th degree and full of the belief that social business is the model of the future. We have endless determination to see School Space grow fast and well, scaling our impact across the UK and beyond. In the mix we have Oxbridge graduates, marathon runners, a pilot, industry veterans, an Olympic torch bearer and a man who once ran a marathon with no training/trainers for an onion bhaji.</p><br /><p><strong>Community Manager</strong><br /><strong>The Role - Why</strong><br />We have an incredible local team that need training, inspiring and leading. You<br />will be responsible for leading a group of up to 80 Community Connectors (part<br />time staff who work based at our schools in the evenings and weekends). You will<br />have administrative support but lead the direction and engagement strategy to<br />ensure our team are empowered with the tools to do their job, with a focus on<br />retention.</p><br /><p><br /><strong>The Role - How</strong><br /><strong><em>Key responsibilities include:</em></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Line Management - whilst most of our remote team work between 5-15 hours per week, they need a point of contact, and you must master supporting them individually whilst drawing on others in your team to balance this responsibility</li><br /><li>Developing and Leading an engagement strategy - our Community Connectors (CCs) already engage via weekly videos from the co-founders and use slack to communicate, but we want you to revamp their &lsquo;journey&rsquo; as a School Space team member, developing the touchpoints they should have to feel supported throughout their lifetime with us</li><br /><li>Developing a training programme - you would be responsible for starting the &lsquo;School Space Academy&rsquo;, which will involve training new starters and providing refreshers for existing staff members.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong><em>What we want from you:</em></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Comfort in working evenings and weekends, as training will have to be done in these hours (expectation; minimum one weekend a month, taken in lieu)</li><br /><li>Experience in leading communities, or managing large groups of people to success.</li><br /><li>A track record of developing a strategy yourself and seeing it through</li><br /><li>Empathy and excellent people skills - an ability to manage but also inspire via &lsquo;low touch&rsquo; methods including innovative techniques</li><br /><li>The ability to self-start and self manage, to bring your own ideas to the table and manage them from start to finish</li><br /><li>Excellent time management and prioritisation skills</li><br /><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills, comfortable with using basic tech tools such as slack</li><br /><li>The ability and desire to work in a fast-paced, challenging environment with peers who challenge you to constantly improve</li><br /><li>An eagerness to take on more responsibility, and you thrive on change - we are a start up and that means things are fast moving.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. </strong><strong>We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, </strong><strong>gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability </strong><strong>status.</strong></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p>",

This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.<br />Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours. Across the UK, connected communities are simply not happening.<br />This is where School Space comes in.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - How</strong><br />Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays.<br />We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the center of a thriving community.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - Team</strong><br />Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 7 years, and recent success includes investment raises, 29 partner schools, over half a million generated for them. We&rsquo;ve been on the Techstars 2018 Cohort, been nominated for Social Enterprise UK&rsquo;s Social Enterprise of the Year, and picked up a few awards and amazing networks along the way. Our team are committed to the n th degree and full of the belief that social business is the model of the future. We have endless determination to see School Space grow fast and well, scaling our impact across the UK and beyond. In the mix we have Oxbridge graduates, marathon runners, a pilot, industry veterans, an Olympic torch bearer and a man who once ran a marathon with no training/trainers for an onion bhaji.</p><br /><p><strong>Community Manager</strong><br /><strong>The Role - Why</strong><br />We have an incredible local team that need training, inspiring and leading. You<br />will be responsible for leading a group of up to 80 Community Connectors (part<br />time staff who work based at our schools in the evenings and weekends). You will<br />have administrative support but lead the direction and engagement strategy to<br />ensure our team are empowered with the tools to do their job, with a focus on<br />retention.</p><br /><p><br /><strong>The Role - How</strong><br /><strong><em>Key responsibilities include:</em></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Line Management - whilst most of our remote team work between 5-15 hours per week, they need a point of contact, and you must master supporting them individually whilst drawing on others in your team to balance this responsibility</li><br /><li>Developing and Leading an engagement strategy - our Community Connectors (CCs) already engage via weekly videos from the co-founders and use slack to communicate, but we want you to revamp their &lsquo;journey&rsquo; as a School Space team member, developing the touchpoints they should have to feel supported throughout their lifetime with us</li><br /><li>Developing a training programme - you would be responsible for starting the &lsquo;School Space Academy&rsquo;, which will involve training new starters and providing refreshers for existing staff members.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong><em>What we want from you:</em></strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Comfort in working evenings and weekends, as training will have to be done in these hours (expectation; minimum one weekend a month, taken in lieu)</li><br /><li>Experience in leading communities, or managing large groups of people to success.</li><br /><li>A track record of developing a strategy yourself and seeing it through</li><br /><li>Empathy and excellent people skills - an ability to manage but also inspire via &lsquo;low touch&rsquo; methods including innovative techniques</li><br /><li>The ability to self-start and self manage, to bring your own ideas to the table and manage them from start to finish</li><br /><li>Excellent time management and prioritisation skills</li><br /><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills, comfortable with using basic tech tools such as slack</li><br /><li>The ability and desire to work in a fast-paced, challenging environment with peers who challenge you to constantly improve</li><br /><li>An eagerness to take on more responsibility, and you thrive on change - we are a start up and that means things are fast moving.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. </strong><strong>We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, </strong><strong>gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability </strong><strong>status.</strong></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p>",

The<br />income generated is used by the schools to improve the educational experience<br />and facilities for their students, in addition to building stronger connections with<br />the surrounding community. Having recently raised significant investment we are<br />entering a period of rapid growth which will see us head towards our goal of giving<br />&pound;7m in income back to our schools by 2020.</p><br /><p><strong>Our culture</strong><br />We strongly believe that our people are at the heart of our success. From weekly<br />update videos from the founders, to regular training days, daily stand-ups, socials<br />and unexpected &lsquo;magic moments&rsquo;. Our core values are Transparency, Positivity,<br />Initiative, Community, Drive/Passion and Learning. We are driven to improve and<br />develop every team member at School Space and actively encourage all team<br />members to proactively contribute to our culture.</p><br /><p><br /><strong>Our impact</strong><br />In the last 12 months, we&rsquo;ve generated over half a million pounds for our partner<br />schools. That equates to 200,000+ free school meals, 40 additional teaching<br />assistants, 85,000 footballs but importantly, a brighter future for those schools.</p><br /><p><strong>Our story</strong><br />In 2010, our founders, James and Jemma, became part of Wheatley Park School&rsquo;s Head Boy and Girl Team.

Below is some basic info about us and the role, so you know what you’re getting into.</p><p><strong>About AirDev</strong></p><p>We founded AirDev to change how custom software is made. Our goals are to dramatically lower the technical and financial barriers to making technical products and to enable people without traditional coding skills to make a good living building those products.</p><p>Co-founders Andrew and Vlad were some of the original Bubble users in 2013, and were amazed at the web platforms they could build without a technical background. They started AirDev in 2015 as the first Bubble agency, building apps for clients of all shapes and sizes.</p><p>We’ve grown significantly since and now help hundreds of clients all over the globe, from one-person startups to large enterprises, build high-quality software in a matter of weeks.</p><p><strong>About the role and its responsibilities</strong></p><p>Product Owners act as the Head of Product/CTO for our clients, helping them think through their idea and turn it into concrete requirements that our developers and designers can execute on. Their primary task is to create a product that’s as good as possible while ensuring that it’s scoped to meet the client’s timeline and budget. Their specific responsibilities include:</p><ul><li>Discuss the project with the client and determine what functionality is needed</li><li>Help the client think through their different options, corner cases, and simplest ways to build something</li><li>Research answers to technical questions that involve API integrations or complex workflows</li><li>Put together detailed specifications and wireframes based on the project requirements as well as our standards</li><li>Work with the development and design teams to execute on the project, providing feedback and guidance as needed</li><li>Help the client iterate on the product based on data, development best practices, and customer feedback</li></ul><p><strong>Qualities we look for</strong></p><p>We value a mix of hard and soft skills, as well alignment to our core values in all of our people. Some specific qualities for this role include:</p><ul><li>Excellent communication skills: Product Owners spend majority of their time interacting with clients, so they need to be very clear and structured in both verbal and written communication.</li><li>Product sense and commitment to simplicity: We see a large range of ideas and Product Owners should be able to quickly figure out the simplest way to turn those ideas into products, no matter what the industry or application.</li><li>Analytical skills: Designing software can be quite complex, so we look for strong conceptual and logical thinkers.</li><li>Software Experience: Ideal candidates will have 2+ years of experience building software, using Bubble or code (as either a developer or Product Manager).</li><li>Time management and being task-oriented: We work with lots of clients at once and always stick to our deadlines, which requires diligence and constantly moving the ball forward.</li><li>Enjoy intellectual &amp; creative challenges: Finding the right technical solution to a human need is both an art and a science, and those who enjoy solving complex problems tend to be best suited for this role.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.airdev.co/job/product-owner-1564508510522x591534616877203500' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

You will need to write,joke, chat, listen, and empathise with them, and will hold the face of ourcompany in your purview.</p><p><i>Reportingand Insights</i></p><p>TheWeekly Growth Sprints are our primary tool for generating all of the HAT’s newbusiness, and the Head of Growth and Marketing that you’ll be working with isresponsible for reporting on how well that work is going to the wholecommercial team, our developers and engineers, and of course the CEO andexecutive.

Which reminds me…</p><p><i>Learning-</i> very, very few people have elite-level experience in high-growth startups.

You’ll have a lot of responsibilitiesand you’ll learn a ton.</p><p><b>The pitch from us:</b></p><p>This is a chance to work on the most important problems in tech: data problems. You can fix Cambridge Analytica and help pioneer the future of the digital economy.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll work with a young, driven growth team with a range of skills.

You will lead the lm group mobile roadmap and your responsibility is to make sure it is implemented according to the traveler’s needs.<br> This includes re-shaping the user journey on our mobile apps for iOS and Android, for all brands.<br> Keep in mind that we are not product driven, we are traveler driven. Which makes you the travelers ambassador, ensuring our product fulfills their unspoken desires.<br> In other words, we are not looking for a babysitter for developers (they are more than able to take care of themselves).

To that end, we build technology for both voters and election administrators that simplifies the process and ensures that no voter should ever have to miss an election.</p><p>TurboVote helps voters register, stay registered, and cast a ballot in every election, from municipal to national. TurboVote served more than 5 million voters in 2018 by building the largest college, nonprofit, and corporate voter engagement coalition in the country, including more than 300 campuses, companies like Starbucks, Univision, Facebook, Google, Snapchat, and dozens more.</p><p>We also manage the The Voting Information Project, which coordinates with state election offices to publish nationally-standardized information about where and how to votedata that powers everything from Googles polling place search to our own text message and email reminders to TurboVote users, and received over 120 million impressions in 2016. Ballot Scout helps election administrators track absentee ballots through the mail, providing transparency in the vote-by-mail process and making it easier to follow up when things go awry. And in 2018, we became the organizational home of the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED).</p><p><strong>Software Development at Democracy Works</strong><br>These products are the work of our 14-developer team. Most of our development involves writing microservices in Clojure running in Docker containers on Kubernetes and hosted on AWS. These services communicate over RabbitMQ and store their data in Datomic. Our users primarily interact with web apps written in ClojureScript and re-frame. We also have projects that use JavaScript, Node, React, Python, and PostgreSQL.</p><p>We pair program, collaborate with product managers, and make sure our efforts deliver value to voters. We define specialized roles and projects on each team so that everyone gets a variety of experience and working relationships and can bring their unique strengths to as wide a swath of our work as possible.</p><p><strong>Where you fit in</strong><br>As CTO, you’ll be helping Democracy Works consolidate our recent growth and prepare for even larger-scale work in 2020 and beyond. In 2018, TurboVote scaled from 1 million to 6 million voters served, and did so with the help of some new tools, from Kubernetes to Twilio Studio. In 2019, were considering how our datasets and products can best improve the voting experience in the years to come, and what infrastructure we still need to build to get there. Our technical work will include removing additional bottlenecks to scale, resolving code debts incurred in the election season, and standardizing how our various projects are deployed, documented, and supported. Were grappling with questions of balancing scale and cost, building core infrastructure while also shipping new features, when and where to introduce specialization within our technical teams, and how to unify our many tools to best support our mission.</p><p><strong>You will:</strong></p><ul><li>Join communities of voter engagement experts and election administrators, and work with our leadership team to define how our data and tools can best support better democratic participation</li><li>Collaborate with our VP Engineering and employee engagement team to ensure that our recruitment, professional development, and people-management all support a diverse and effective developer team</li><li>Develop and implement policies and best practices to maximize the security of our data and applications</li><li>Review and approve architectural decisions with an eye toward standardizing practices across programs and products</li><li>Communicate directly with senior leadership, individual developers, and product leads to understand and support their needs and goals</li></ul><p><strong>You are:</strong></p><ul><li>A skilled communicator who takes pride in distilling complex concepts into simple components</li><li>A strategic planner capable of translating an ambitious mission into architecture, process, and code</li><li>Creative, in the way that sees constraints and trade-offs as puzzles to solve rather than obstacles to success</li><li>Curious, excited to learn about the areas of our work that youre not already familiar with</li><li>Empathetic, a decision-maker who considers how our choices can affect voters, developers, and stakeholders</li><li>Someone who enjoys wearing multiple hats and bringing different disciplines together in pursuit of a goal</li></ul><p><strong>You have experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Building, deploying, and scaling complex products</li><li>Managing others we expect that this role will have only two direct reports, but will be involved in personnel decisions affecting many others</li><li>Learning and using a wide range of technologies and tools</li><li>Both in a developer role and (ideally) in other positions, whether product, design, or leadership</li><li>Working closely with non-engineering colleagues</li></ul><p><strong>Physical demands</strong></p><p>This position requires regular, daily use of a computer.</p><p>Democracy Works is committed to diversity and inclusion in everything we do and aspires to have a team that’s representative of the voters we serve. When hiring, we practice proactive outreach to top talent thats underrepresented in our sector (including Latino, Black, AAPI, and Indigenous candidates).

One of our core behaviors is to lead by serving others, and we’re looking for a people-focused manager to help define what that looks like. Our team has recently grown from 5 to 10 individual contributors in a few months in order to support our customers and unlock more opportunities.</p><p>This is a full-time, salaried position that includes equity, health, dental, and vision benefits. In addition to these benefits, we offer awesome perks that reflect our commitment to the physical and mental well-being of every member of our team. Enjoy a $1,000 bonus for taking your first vacation over 5 days with us, a monthly stipend for health and wellness expenses, flexible parental leave, and more. Compensation will vary based on where you’ll work from — the base range for San Francisco is $170,000 – $190,000.</p><p>Note: You’ll need valid U.S. work authorization to join us.</p><p><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></p><ul><li>Build relationships of trust and psychological safety with your reports.</li><li>Help your reports uncover a growth plan based on their interests and aptitude, identifying the right strategy to help them achieve that plan (whether it’s sponsoring them for an opportunity, or coaching them on specific skills).</li><li>Create a positive environment where your team feels safe to communicate openly, share constructive criticism and contribute innovative ideas.</li><li>Help resolve conflicts between your reports and their peers, coaching them on radical candor and stepping in when necessary.</li><li>Establish strong partnerships with your cross-functional peers in each product area that your reports work on, improving collaboration and trust for your reports.</li><li>Contribute to and drive initiatives to codify operations and processes that help the design team produce work they’re proud of.</li><li>Help recruit and retain talented designers, staffing them on teams that leverage their strengths and provide opportunities for growth.</li></ul><p><strong>We’d love to hear from you if: </strong></p><ul><li>You believe in people management through servant leadership, and view the success and fulfillment of your reports as your primary goal. (This is not a Creative Director position where you tell your reports what to do.)</li><li>You apply a user-oriented design process to managing a team. You ask questions and receive buy-in before making decisions that will impact your reports.</li><li>You understand when to be supportive, when to be directive, and when to sponsor your reports.</li><li>You have a strong understanding of a designer’s career levels (from entry-level through senior roles) and how each person has different strengths. You know how to level and an incoming candidate, staffing them on the appropriate team, and have successfully helped individual contributors get promoted.</li><li>You’ve helped struggling performers get back on track or find a new opportunity.</li><li>You practice radical candor and know how to coach others situationally.</li><li>You can navigate a company building a complex tool with many moving parts.</li><li>You understand management is not a one-size-fits-all solution, that every report needs a different approach at different stages in their career, but also believe that standardized operations can help set consistent expectations.</li><li>You have managed a team of designers in a full-time role.

So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

We help them send automated messaging that their customers actually like to receive. If that’s exciting to you, we should talk.</p><p>Our current team includes designers who are passionate about developing our design system and improving our visual design. We would love to add a Product Designer with a specific interest in solving the complex user experience problems in our product.</p><p><strong>About Customer.io</strong></p><p>We believe that businesses who create strong relationships with their customers will outperform the ones who don’t.</p><p>Were working to make Customer.io the default choice for any internet business to deliver great, automated customer experiences at scale. Customer.io is used by over 1200 businesses to create continuity after a person leaves a website or mobile app. Every message (receipts, win-backs, and onboarding) across every channel (email, push, sms and more) can be managed and measured in Customer.io.</p><p><strong>What will you be doing as Product Designer?</strong></p><ul><li>Sketching exploratory designs and customer journeys for new features.</li><li>Building high fidelity mockups and sharing opinionated design proposals in Slack and Notion.</li><li>Collecting and acting on feedback from your peers and our customers.</li><li>Pairing with developers to bring ideas to life in interactive prototypes.</li><li>Iterating on our design system by making improvements to foundational styles, components, and processes.</li></ul><p><strong>Examples of some recent projects we’ve worked on:</strong></p><ol><li>Transitioning all of our page layouts to card-based layouts to help users focus on content.</li><li>Designing a drag-and-drop workflow builder so people can visualize complex automated messaging workflows.</li><li>Discussing and writing guidelines for our take on accessibility (check it out in our WIP design system documentation)</li></ol><p><strong>What will you bring to the table?</strong></p><ul><li>If you identify as a UX or UI designer, that’s okay. We don’t care much about labels.</li><li>The most important thing: You have a deep interest in finding ways to&nbsp;<strong>improve UX in complex flows</strong>&nbsp;and features.</li><li>You have a solid understanding of&nbsp;<strong>interaction design</strong>&nbsp;methods and best practices (including journey mapping, human computer interaction, and animations).</li><li>You have&nbsp;<strong>a growth mindset</strong>&nbsp;and are willing to challenge our team and propose changes to how we do things.</li><li>You&nbsp;<strong>genuinely care about understanding the outcomes of products you work on</strong>&nbsp;and will make design decisions that protect our customers and their end-users.</li><li>You can&nbsp;<strong>present your work clearly</strong>&nbsp;to an asynchronous team.</li><li>You have&nbsp;<strong>experience in user research</strong>&nbsp;and usability testing practices.</li></ul><p><strong>And bonus if you have these skills too:</strong></p><ul><li>Ability to level-up our copy strategy.</li><li>Experience working with SVGs and creating illustrations.</li><li>Visual design acumen (color, typography, iconography).</li><li>Understanding of HTML, CSS, and git.</li></ul><p><strong>Why should you work with Customer.io?</strong></p><p>We’re in a special moment as a company: small enough where you’ll have a big impact as an individual, big enough to have resources to conquer ambitious goals as a team, yet calm about how we set growth goals.</p><p><strong>We are a remote-first company – we have employees in Australia, the United States, India, and beyond. We meet up twice a year to get to know each other,&nbsp;</strong>but prioritize asynchronous communication strategies that help us build strong relationships from wherever we choose to work.</p><p>We do a lot of research to ensure everyone is paid well and think our new Product Designer will be paid around $90,000-$110,000, but will adjust for experience. Check out our career’s page for more information on our great benefits and why you should come work with us!</p><p><strong>Diversity statement</strong></p><p>We want to build and maintain a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment where everyone has the opportunity to learn, mentor, and grow. We know that diverse teams make better products, and especially encourage applicants from underrepresented groups to apply if you have any questions, please let us know. We want people with different backgrounds from the team we have today to bring their perspective and thoughtfulness to the work that we do and the culture were always working to build.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/customerio/jobs/1806501' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

You ask a lot of questions. You’re decisive.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>As Community Manager at MitoHQ, your primary job is to understand our customer— what motivates them, what makes their job difficult, and what simply delights them. You will take these constant and ongoing learnings and deftly apply them to the way we position our brand and movement to the world. After all, social business is at its very core, all about people.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your previous experience growing a highly engaged community will enable you to oversee the customer engagement through all social channels.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Sometimes you’ll be looking at our community management from a high level view—say, determining our key objectives for the quarter or the year. Other days, you may be down in the weeds yourself, slicing content to suit each channel or working with others on the marketing team to run A/B conversion tests on site. You’re comfortable—and happy—doing both.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>What you don’t know, you’ll openly admit, but then you’ll get to work figuring it out (asking others for help and/or digging deep on your own). Your self-motivation and a relentless drive to learn/do more are appreciated by all. You pride yourself on being a “clever thinker”.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’re comfortable talking with and working alongside our operations, marketing and leadership teams. You understand your critical part in the overall machine, graciously accepting thoughts and feedback from others while offering your own expertise where you can. You pride yourself on being “overly communicative” -- keeping everyone up to date with the latest social marketing wins, losses, and initiatives.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>You are comfortable working remotely as part of a small team, with a high level of autonomy. You can devise your own schedule and effectively manage your workload based on the biggest opportunities and company objectives.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>When you’re in the wrong or make a mistake you can admit it. You can articulate why it happened and how you’ve learned from the experience.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your timezone location is not important as long as you are available for calls with leadership during business hours in Sydney Australia.</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>Above all, you understand that your success—and our success—hinges on the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers.&nbsp;</span></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h5><span>Corner the market[ing]</span></h5><br></div><div><span>MitoHQ is a social enterprise and is driven by community.

Failures are learnings.</li><li><b>Integrity</b>- Keep your word. Be whole and complete.</li><li><b>Growth</b>- A hunger for professional improvement.

Understanding that what you do has value.</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>We are also one of the early adopters of the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)</b>, a new style of running an organization in a self-organizing manner that draws inspiration from agile software development and lean manufacturing processes.</div><div><br></div><div>Rather than hiring people for exactly one job description, we instead look to find well-rounded team members and flexible thinkers; those who can survey a wide range of sources, synthesize key insights and recommend actionable strategies to propel GorillaDesk into the future.</div><div><br></div><div><b>As a self-organizing team, our people have multiple roles and our job descriptions, including this one, are regularly updated via small iterations.&nbsp;</b>As their interests change and our needs change, the roles people fill change dynamically over time.</div><div><br></div><div><i>'Most startups believe in iteration of their products.

By the end of this phase, you will have a clear vision and direction, and all the building blocks you need to build your first end-to-end sales funnel. The activities that will help you during this phase include:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Buyer Persona Identification</li><li>Sales Pitch Development</li><li>Brand Visual Development</li><li>Brand Messaging</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>Phase 2:&nbsp;</b>Bridge the gap between GorillaDesk and the people who want to buy from us.

This is a dream job for anyone who enjoys monitoring political developments, quickly pulling together a plan, writing fast, and getting fired up about holding politicians and corporate executives accountable.</p><p>We are a small but powerful activism team. Our vision: a world where everyone can access the Internet affordably, free of interference and censorship and with full privacy. To accomplish this, we are using the Internet in innovative ways to mobilize people on a scale previously thought to be impossible. We’ve built the technology and created the messaging behind the largest online protests in history, including organizing the campaign that defeated SOPA/PIPA, and winning net neutrality rules in 2014. Just last month, we garnered over 6 million views while livestreaming the Congressional debate over the Save the Internet Act, generating tens of thousands of phone calls and letters to Congress.</p><p>We work on a number of issues at the intersection of technology and human rights, from facial recognition surveillance to the use of Artificial Intelligence in the criminal justice system to protecting net neutrality (also known as the free speech fight of our generation) to defending decentralized technologies and alternatives. Our model of activism relies on a relentless focus on strategy and working toward specific wins; campaigning that taps into the power of the Internet; and the ability to speak with a strong voice online. <strong>We are a fully remote organization and you would work from home or a shared work space.</strong></p><p>We’re looking for smart and strategic candidates with excellent writing skills and the drive to make urgent but critical wins on a quick timeline.</p><p>Your day-to-day could include generating an avalanche of phone calls on the issue to a decision-maker or generating so much media media coverage that a C.E.O resigns.</p><p><strong>More specifically, you will be:</strong></p><ul><li>Identifying, monitoring, and analyzing political developments around Internet freedom and tech policy issues related to our campaigns and policy positions at the state, federal, and international level.</li><li>Quickly assessing the opportunity (good or bad) and what role FFTF should play, who the key decision-makers are, and which actions would be most strategic, coordinating closely with the campaigns team. Work closely with FFTF’s Deputy Director and Campaign Director around strategic responses and coordinate new positions as needed.</li><li>Creating high-quality, engaging communications materials including mass emails and SMS, news pitches, campaign pages, event materials, and social media content.</li><li>Acting as a spokesperson to the media on our campaigns when needed.</li><li>Working with designers and developers as a project manager of websites, campaign actions, and more.</li><li>Supporting other organizational needs such as staff and volunteer recruitment, fundraising, and special projects.</li></ul><p><strong>What we’re looking for in you:</strong></p><ul><li>You have at least three years of experience in relevant fields which include communications, campaigns, advocacy, grassroots organizing, digital marketing, or journalism.</li><li>You have experience in campaigning and understand what it takes to move the needle, the messaging that will move people, and the steps to get us there.</li><li>You have significant writing experience and love to write, especially for large audiences, including online audiences and traditional media. You can synthesize complex ideas into concise, easily understandable copy for the web. Your writing can speak to people’s humor, fears and what gets both their head nodding and heart pumping.</li><li>You are familiar with the pace of news cycle and understands how quickly you need to move and hard you need to hustle to ensure our voice is heard.</li><li>You have experience generating media coverage on campaigns including developing relationships with traditional media sources.</li><li>You have experience at generating media coverage on campaigns, including writing press materials and reaching out and developing relationships with traditional media sources.</li><li>You have experience with and a commitment to working with people from a variety of backgrounds, including racial, ethnic, socio-economic, and religious backgrounds, and people from the LGBTQ community.</li><li>You are fascinated by the power of the Internet and have used it in creative ways.</li><li>You have a rigorous and thought-provoking perspective on a wide range of political issues. You are a thinker and someone who can synthesize a problem or an idea out of ordinary interaction and someone’s frustrations/struggles.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for:</strong></p><ul><li>A background working on digital campaigns that grow fast.</li><li>Previous experience in Internet or digital rights policy and issues.</li><li>Experience and comfort with working remotely.</li><li>Coding, web design, or marketing skills.</li><li>An commitment to an interest outside of your professional life, such as art, music, sports, hiking, or the outdoors.</li></ul><p><strong>Who you will work with:</strong></p><p>As FFTF’s Communications Specialist, you will work closely with the organization’s Executive Director and Deputy Director who have a combined 30+ years in campaigning, our campaigns staff, and a world class designer and senior software engineer which will position you well to build the tech needed on any campaign. Our team comes from a variety of backgrounds — including startups, the music industry, and campaign organizations. We’re looking for well-rounded individuals who have a range of interests, can do a little bit of everything, and know what they’re really good at! We pride ourselves on being a welcoming place to work for women, the LGBTQ community, people of color, people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds, as well as parents.</p><p><strong>Compensation:</strong></p><p><strong>This is a full-time position and the range for this position is a total compensation package of $50-$75K</strong>, depending on experience. Benefits include the option for full health care and partially covered dental benefits, the value of which would be included in the total compensation package. Additional benefits include a 401K plan and paid sick, vacation, and federal holidays days. We offer support for remote work, training and mentoring, and a driven, highly collaborative, supportive work environment.</p><p><strong>Location:</strong></p><p><strong>Fight for the Future is a 100% remote organization so no need to commute or relocate. Our staff are based all over the country (and a couple of international locations too) and work in their homes or shared work spaces over video, slack, and through project management tools.</strong></p><p><strong>How to apply:</strong></p><p>In your application, please let us know where you heard about the jobs and include links to or samples of your writing—ideally in situations where you’re writing to persuade a group of people. Include as much relevant information as you like: significant things you’ve accomplished and projects you’ve worked on. Being well-rounded is a plus, so don’t exclude significant skills or achievements just because they aren’t activism related (such as starting a business or being a musician).</p><p><em>Fight for the Future is an equal opportunity and inclusive employer. FFTF does not and shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion (creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), disability, marital status, sexual orientation, or military status, in any of its activities or operations. We believe that a diverse staff enables us to better understand and serve our members, audience and community. Women, people of color, and members of low-income, disadvantaged, and LGBTQ communities are strongly encouraged to apply.</em></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://fightforthefuture.applytojob.com/apply/QQ4o7k4R6K/Communications-Specialist-remote-Can-Be-Based-Anywhere-In-The-US' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Today, the GitHub community includes over 36 Million users, and north of 100M user repositories. It is hands-down the largest developer community in the world, and in turn, GitHub has become the most visible and beloved brand in the developer ecosystem.</p><p>In June of 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for $7.5B, a massive, and highly visible acquisition that was officially completed in the fall of 2018. Since then, Satya Nadella has spoken extensively about the responsibility to the developer world that comes with the GitHub acquisition, and Microsoft’s continued commitment to developer freedom. GitHub is operated as an independent business with a developer-first ethos and a completely open approach to ALL clouds. Microsoft already houses more open source code than any company in the world. The goal in the acquisition is simply for GitHub to become the number one company in the developer world!</p><p>The question is now: how do we leverage GitHub’s enormous user community and highly visible brand to continue to build a world-class business, and continue to be the most important company in the world for developers. Given GitHub’s centrality within the developer ecosystem – the most important part of the entire tech ecosystem – the possibilities for GitHub from a product standpoint are nearly limitless. In the past six months GitHub has dramatically accelerated its product and future roadmap to include innovations that further distance GitHub from its competitors.</p><p></p><strong>The Product Marketing Team</strong><p>Product Marketing operates at the intersection of product management, sales, and the larger marketing organization. We collaborate closely with these teams and other areas of the company to clearly communicate the value of our solutions to our users and customers. We support upwards of 100 product ships each year to millions of users and thousands of companies all over the planet. In addition we help shape the overall company strategy and message, including our naming, packaging, and pricing for all products.</p><p></p><strong>On a day-to-day basis, you will:</strong><ul></ul><li>Create clear, differentiated messaging and positioning for our products.</li><li>Work closely with PMM peers to quickly iterate and refine our messaging and content</li><li>Support our product launch process, including company readiness, collateral updates, PR/AR initiatives, digital campaigns, and demand gen programs</li><li>Support the development for content generation across all our properties and campaigns.</li><li>Develop collateral including white papers, blogs, and presentations</li><li>Support the creation of enablement materials such as demos and videos for customer facing teams (sales, sales engineers, consulting, etc)</li><li>Support a rigorous competitive analysis program with deep resources and succinct summaries</li><p></p><strong>You should have:</strong><ul></ul><li>3-7 years of experience in enterprise software, preferably focused on SDLC, open source, or platform technologies</li><li>Demonstrated ability to collaborate on successful projects in a fast-paced entrepreneurial environment</li><li>Ability to influence wide audiences at all levels and work effectively across functions and geographies</li><li>Be comfortable working with data, and embrace of evidence-based practices for marketing</li><li>Strong interpersonal skills; world class written and oral communications skills</li><li>Joy in collaboration with colleagues, sometimes leading, sometimes following</li><li>Solid understanding of developer workflows and tooling</li><li>Experience marketing to developers</li><li>Deep understanding of GitHub, our users, and at least one programming language a major plus.</li><p></p><strong>Who We Are:</strong><p>GitHub is the developer company. Over 36 million people use GitHub to build amazing things together across 100 million repositories. We make it easier for developers to be developers: to work together, to solve challenging problems, to create the world’s most important technologies. We foster a collaborative community that can come together—as individuals and in teams—to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.</p><p></p><strong>What We Value:</strong><p>&nbsp;We believe the best work is done together. &nbsp;We believe in putting people first. &nbsp;We believe in setting the standard for excellence. &nbsp;We believe in making the world a better place through our work. &nbsp;We believe in creating things for the people using them.</p><em>Collaboration:</em><br><em>Empathy:</em><br><em>Quality:</em><br><em>Positive Impact:</em><br><em>Shipping:</em><p></p><strong>Why You Should Join:</strong><p>At GitHub, we constantly strive to create an environment that allows our employees (Hubbers) to do the best work of their lives. We’ve designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily. The other half of our Hubbers work remotely in 18 countries across the globe.&nbsp;</p><a href='https://github.com/about/careers/remote' rel='nofollow'>Here is a complete list of where we can hire!</a><p>We are also committed to keeping Hubbers healthy, motivated, focused and creative.

We embrace diversity and invite applications from people of all walks of life. We don’t discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, disability, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences.

    "content": "Timeular is looking for a *Remote Growth Marketer* to join our growth team in scaling our user base.<br />(Note: this role is 100% remote, you can be based anywhere).<br /><br />We’re looking for someone who treats acquisition as part of the core user experience and therefore is eager to dive deep to find out what our users really need so you can tune every piece of the acquisition and create a smooth and engaging experience starting already from the first touch point.<br /><br />Timeular enables people to improve their time management to create more value for themselves and the people around them. Basically, it’s about helping people to focus on the right things, getting rid of distractions and ultimately create more value in fewer hours, which they hopefully will use to enjoy their life outside of work.<br /><br />As we live what we pray we will not ask you to work a crazy amount of hours. In fact, we try hard to protect your time. In return, we ask you to do your best job every day every 40 hour week.<br /><br />We are a fully remote team of 16 people working from 5 countries and are between 20 and 40 years old. You can work whenever you want but we’re accepting applications only from people living in a timezone somewhere starting from GMT-4 till GMT+2 (GMT-5 till GMT+1 in winter northern hemisphere).<br /><br />*ABOUT THIS ROLE*<br /><br />You’ll be responsible to establish new growth loops and improve current ones to scale our Timeular user base in a sustainable and predictable way. While this is a very broad definition of your long-term goal, here is what you can start with until you have enough insights to come up with your own roadmap.<br /><br />*Improve acquisition conversion rates*<br /><br />* Dive into our Google Analytics and Mixpanel data together with the retention team to understand even better which customer-behaviour we provide the most value for and where are touchpoints we could acquire more of them.<br />* Find, prioritize and run experiments to test your hypothesis for how to improve conversion rates and analyze the outcome. Mainly on our paid ads and on the webshop.<br />* Facebook and Google Ads are currently our main acquisition channels. Support your colleagues in creating more efficient creatives and landing pages or to automate spending.<br /><br />*Align our messaging and content*<br /><br />* We aim to increase our traffic through helpful content that’s worth to be shared. Help us to build and tune a scalable content growth loop.<br />* Find the sweet spot between our users’ voice and our values and make sure all our customer facing communication aligns with that.<br />* We didn’t really invest in SEO so far. If you have strong experience there, it’s all yours and ready to go in order to increase our organic traffic.<br /><br />*Lead people*<br /><br />* Identify and prioritize the biggest issues we should focus our resources next.<br />* Manage the implementation and iteration for solutions you come up with. Write and specify tickets and approve the implementations for release.<br />* Help to find and onboard new people so they can do their best work and support them when they need orientation.<br /><br />We know you can’t perform at your best from day one because everything is new and there is a lot of information to absorb first. That’s why you’ll get assigned an onboarding buddy right after joining Timeular to assist you while getting started with your new challenges and all the questions you might have along the way.<br /><br />*ABOUT YOU AND OUR CULTURE*<br /><br />As we work remotely, we communicate a lot in written form. To help you demonstrate the strong writing skills you’ll need for this role, we’ve made the first part of this application process a written task.<br /><br />We believe that the most time efficient communication style, whether it’s client-facing or with your team members, is to be direct but respectful. We’re honest and transparent to each other and we support each other. So should you.<br /><br />We work in cycles. We prioritize our top challenges and pitch solutions in a two week pre-cycle and then focus on getting the most promising solutions out within 6 weeks in mixed teams that change at every cycle.<br /><br />We are a virtual team, meaning there is physically no-one around you and you should feel comfortable working like this most of the time. While we do a lot to bring people together it’s unavoidable that loneliness and de-motivation might hit you here and there. We have all been through this and have learned a few things.<br /><br />We respect time because time is the most valuable thing we have: we show up, deliver and communicate in time. We respect everyone’s private time unless there is a real urgency.<br /><br />We say no to distractions and focus on the important things. We seek the minimal path with the highest possible output. We single task our way along that path. We keep meetings efficient. Basically, we focus on focus.<br /><br />*ABOUT THE PAY AND BENEFITS*<br /><br />We’re still at the beginning of our journey and therefore can’t afford to pay huge salaries; however we manage that with other benefits, which are mostly about helping you to live a healthy life outside of work.<br /><br />The transparent salary for this role at hiring ranges between $40,000 and $80,000, depending on several factors like the country you’re in (taxes, living costs etc…) and your experience. After one year of working full-time at Timeular you can participate in the employee stock option pool.<br /><br />The benefits we offer are:<br /><br />* Work where, when and how you want as long it is in GMT-4 to GMT+2 (GMT-5 till GMT+1 in winter northern hemisphere).<br />* 50 days of paid holidays (including national holidays) because we’ve learned that time off is the best source for great ideas.<br />* Three paid team retreats per year to spend an incredible time together discovering unique locations and amazing food. All costs covered.<br />* Paid parental leave and a couple more benefits<br /><br />*HOW THE APPLICATION PROCESS WORKS*<br /><br />We care about who you are today, what you have achieved so far and where do you want to go.<br /><br />Our application process is pretty simple: we start with asking you a few questions in written form, you answer them the best you can, we read it and, if we like it, we jump on a call to get to know each other better. If that goes well, we do a test period so we both can verify our expectations and if we both agree, you’re in.<br /><br />As we value good clear writing skills, take your time to send your application. When you see a question with Why, dig deep to find the real root-why before answering. We value if you answer with facts and numbers.<br /><br />When we ask for example tasks, write your reply like you would think aloud: imagine you’re doing the task and walk us through your thinking from the starting point until the outcome.<br /><br />*MAKE YOUR TIME COUNT WITH US AND APPLY*<br /><br />If you made it this far, then we assume you’re interested and are likely a good fit. Please apply and we will send you a form to fill in.<br /><br />As we always get many applications it might take some time till we get back to you after having evaluated all the applications.",

Cash remuneration between £60 - 75k with a total package value exceeding £100k.\n<br>\n<br>About the job\n<br>\n<br>We are looking for an exceptional COO to drive operational excellence and growth. This is a rare opportunity to enter a senior position at a funded start-up, established 4 years ago that is now entering scale-up phase.\n<br>\n<br>Reporting to the CEO, the COO will take charge of the Operations, Finance, Talent and People functions. They will also act as a bridge, coordinating people across the company. Initial responsibility will be for 7 staff (3 of which are direct reports) within these functional areas.\n<br>\n<br>Our mission\n<br>\n<br>At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper. One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. \n<br>\n<br>This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it. We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.\n<br>\n<br>Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.\n<br>\n<br>Our Journey\n<br>\n<br>We may be only four years old, but it’s already been quite a ride. We are already working with 45 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 250% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact. We are a team of 25 passionate and ambitious people driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords.\n<br>\n<br>We are looking for an outstanding individual to join our senior leadership team. Your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.\n<br>\n<br>Your responsibilities\n<br>\n<br>As COO, you will drive our business operations to deliver against our ambitious expansion goals by planning and coordinating activities between key teams. You will be responsible for instilling and developing a culture of operating excellence and fostering an aligned, focused and productive environment within the company. You will anticipate operational issues and resolve them proactively before they arise.\n<br>\n<br>Your direct areas of responsibility include, but are not limited to:\n<br>\n<br>• Running the finance department and managing our financial controller.\n<br>\n<br>• Overseeing the operations team including supply chain, manufacturing, customer support and installer support.\n<br>\n<br>• Managing our Head of Talent and Workspace, assisting in getting great people into the business and maintaining our excellent culture.\n<br>\n<br>• Contributing to company strategy, sitting on the senior leadership team.\n<br>\n<br>• Helping the founders execute on fundraising.\n<br>\n<br>• Positioning the company for scale through developing and sharing best practices.\n<br>\n<br>• Attending certain board meetings in an observer capacity.\n<br>\n<br>We are a company built on a strong technical foundation. You’ll need to grasp and communicate a technical solution with staff and external stakeholders.\n<br>\n<br>Your experience\n<br>\n<br>We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:\n<br>\n<br>• A financial pedigree (e.g. MBA, ex CEO/CFO, finance sector / fundraising experience etc)\n<br>\n<br>• Ability to run a finance function that includes planning and fundraising\n<br>\n<br>• A proven track record of leading and scaling high growth organisations\n<br>\n<br>• Experience in designing and improving management reporting processes\n<br>\n<br>• Open-mindedness and ability to improve in response to constructive feedback\n<br>\n<br>• Ability to work horizontally across multiple functional groups\n<br>\n<br>• Strong leadership capabilities and aspiration for excellence\n<br>\n<br>• Proven capabilities in growing talent and teams\n<br>\n<br>• Experience coaching team members, including leaders of teams\n<br>\n<br>• Ability to communicate with credibility and gravitas both internally and externally\n<br>\n<br>• An excellent academic record\n<br>\n<br>• Knowledge of the housing sector is a bonus but not required.\n<br>\n<br>About You\n<br>\n<br>We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:\n<br>\n<br>• You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.\n<br>\n<br>• You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market\n<br>\n<br>• You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems\n<br>\n<br>• You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them. \n<br>\n<br>• You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.\n<br>\n<br>• You’re open, positive &amp; straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.\n<br>\n<br>• You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.\n<br>\n<br>You can expect…\n<br>\n<br>We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family.\n<br>\n<br>We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues. We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location. This year we took the whole team to Spain.\n<br>\n<br>If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.

We use data from 11 fixed passive sensors placed around an individual’s home and a wearable device. Each sensor picks up a key activity such as toilet usage, sleep patterns, heart-rate and drinking / eating habits (approximately 5,000 data points). This is where our AI kicks in. Our machines learn a personalised weighting model that can alert to indicators of dehydration, malnutrition, declining mobility/ independence and onset of poor physical or mental health. \n<br>We sell B2B. Our customers are Councils, Retirement Communities, Housing Associations and Care Providers. The alert notifications and corresponding datasets are shown via a dashboard so they can effectively manage emerging care needs before they escalate. The end user can also nominate carer’s or family to receive notifications via an app.\n<br>We’re different because our AI isn’t an after-thought, it’s what has driven us for the start. We collect action-based data and our data scientists and clinical researchers build and refine our algorithms in house. We’re Web 3.0 ready, end users own their own data and can share it with whomever they choose. \n<br>\n<br>Check us out:\n<br>&quot;Website&quot;:https://www.mysense.ai\n<br>&quot;LinkedIn&quot;:https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense\n<br>\n<br>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.",

You will take these constant and ongoing learnings and deftly apply them to the way we position our brand and product to the world. After all, product marketing is at its very core, “people marketing”.&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Your previous experience creating successful go-to-market plans (from high-level strategy down to tactical execution) will enable you to oversee the rollout of all new products and feature updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Sometimes you’ll be looking at our product marketing from a high level view—say, determining our key objectives for the quarter or the year. Other days, you may be down in the weeds yourself, writing landing page copy or working with others on the marketing team to run A/B conversion tests on site. You’re comfortable—and happy—doing both.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  What you don’t know, you’ll openly admit, but then you’ll get to work figuring it out (asking others for help and/or digging deep on your own). Your self-motivation and a relentless drive to learn/do more are appreciated by all. You pride yourself on being a “clever thinker”.&nbsp; You’re comfortable talking with and working alongside our product, sales, development, and customer success teams. You understand your critical part in the overall machine, graciously accepting thoughts and feedback from others while offering your own expertise where you can. You pride yourself on being “overly communicative” -- keeping everyone up to date with the latest product marketing wins, losses, and initiatives.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You are comfortable working remotely as part of a small team, with a high level of autonomy. You can devise your own schedule and effectively manage your workload based on the biggest opportunities and company objectives.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  When you’re in the wrong or make a mistake you can admit it. You can articulate why it happened and how you’ve learned from the experience.&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You are in a European or American timezone.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Above all, you understand that your success—and our success—hinges on the satisfaction and loyalty of our customers.&nbsp;\n </div>\n <div>\n  <b><br></b>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>About The Role</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You will be responsible for championing the features and benefits of the Close sales platform through our marketing messaging and market positioning.

Our long term aim is to create a single network where people and businesses can share their digital identity securely and interchangeably - whether they’re applying for a mortgage, listing on the stock market, or applying for a new job.

You also have a knack for writing intelligent, witty copy; you probably take photos in your free time, dabble with Lightroom, and your IG game is beyond strong. \n  <br> \n  <br>**About us:** \n  <br> \n  <br>Drops’ goal is to turn language learning into a delightful, effective game. Our primary app, Drops, has been in the App Store for over 3 years, teaches 33 languages, and was featured by both the App Store and Play Store multiple times. It was Google’s Best App of 2018. We are a small, passionate remote team mainly spread across Europe, with a small outpost in California. We mostly work synchronously, so working hour overlap does matter for us. The company is still run by the founders. We communicate via Slack, Git, and Trello. We want to be the no.1 app for vocabulary learning and we are getting there quickly with our current user base of 14 million, a monthly active of &gt;1,500,000 and an average store rating of 4.7. \n  <br> \n  <br>You can find us here: http://drops.app.link/ \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br># Responsibilities \n  <br> **You will:** \n  <br> \n  <br>Be responsible for all social media, with major emphasis on Instagram. \n  <br>Edit all content, as well as writing a good bit of it. \n  <br>Make all content written by another team member sound almost as witty and brilliant as your own. \n  <br>Develop and pitch creative campaigns with indisputable success metrics. \n  <br>Ideate and collaborate with our product and marketing teams on all projects that involve social media or content marketing, and any other projects you find interesting. \n  <br>Persuade our product developers and marketing team to integrate social media. \n  <br>Strike envy in the hearts and minds of the social media managers of our competitors. \n  <br>You will work with our legal advisor to execute influencer contracts. \n  <br>Strike envy in the hearts of the social media managers of our competitors. \n  <br> \n  <br># Requirements \n  <br>**You have:** \n  <br> \n  <br>* A proven social media and content management track record - including executed, impactful creative campaigns. \n  <br>* Strong verbal and written communication skills in English and the ability to work well cross-functionally. \n  <br>* You are native in these softwares: G-suite (docs, spreadsheet, etc), Slack, Trello, Planoly, Excel/Numbers, Words/Pages, Adobe Creative Suite \n  <br>* Project management experience (everyone is managing projects at Drops) \n  <br> \n  <br>**Our Ideal Candidate:** \n  <br> \n  <br>* You live in Europe, or within the GMT time zone + or - 2 hours. \n  <br>* You speak and write native English. \n  <br>* You’re a social media maven. You have undeniable examples of how you elevated your brand—or the brand of a company—via creative social media engagement--especially through Instagram \n  <br>* You’re sufficiently well spoken—and well written—in long-form and social media lingo. Your editing skills are as good or better than your writing skills. \n  <br>* You hate useless punctuation, but love full stops., \n  <br>* You detest inconsistent capitalization You know that true em dashes are always better than --. \n  <br>* You love finding the perfect post or campaign that sparks a fire. \n  <br>* You love tracking and measuring just how intense that fires gets. \n  <br>* You don’t just know and use best social media best practices but blaze trail with never-been-seen ideas. \n  <br>* You can make that fire spark another. Maybe you’re not a maven. Maybe you’re a social pyromaniac. \n  <br>* You stalk the most unapproachable of influencers and can negotiate anything for a free license. \n  <br>* You’re a perfectionist re: all media you use--prefer creating your own visual assets, but can cost-efficiently manage in-house or outsourced designers for the bigger stuff. \n  <br>* You love proving - preferably with numbers - to engineers that social media and content do matter. In acquisitions, in retention, in $. \n  <br>* You love language learning, whether you’re good at it or not. At the very least, you’re willing to obsess over what makes language learners tick. \n  <br>* We’re building a small, but super capable team. You’re naturally more interested in the fate of the product &amp; driven to grow professionally, than in managing people. \n  <br>* We are looking for a missionary rather than a mercenary. \n  <br>* We value clear and honest communication and transparency - it’s the linchpin of our culture and current success, and freedom. You will be involved in both high and low level decision making, and will be available during European working hours (9AM - 6PM GMT). \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>#Location \n  <br>- EU-only \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

(Hourly rate TBC)\n<br>Benefits: - \n<br>\n<br>__Mission for role__\n<br>*To head up all aspects of marketing for Eco Companion, focusing in particular on specific KPIs that matter to the business - most importantly increasing sales made through our new booking engine!*\n<br>\n<br>We’re now looking for a new marketing manager to come in to take charge of all aspects of our marketing efforts! We have already made great progress, in particular with social media where we now have a following of over 150,000 on our own network and also a community of content creators called Eco Companion Journalists we work with. We also have a good starting point of a mailing list to be built on. You will have free reign to work alongside me (Max the founder) in particular to work on driving more people down the funnel towards ultimately making a booking through the Eco Companion website.\n<br>\n<br>Eco Companion is now over 4 years old and has pivoted now into a tailor made eco tourism tour operator. So we’re building a higher end experience for people looking to travel to the natural world in a way that sincerely does improve the world! \n<br>\n<br>We are barely yet making bookings as we’ve focused on developing the core experience delivered through our website. This work is largely done now though and so we’re eager to push the marketing and advertising. Though with a very small budget initially.\n<br>\n<br>We represent high risk as you will be working for a startup that’s only just gone professional. So don’t expect big pay cheques straight away (and if you’re just in it for the cash then this isn’t the role for you). However, what you will find whilst working for Eco Companion is a much faster rate of growth for you as a person than you could ever hope to achieve within a larger corporate enterprise.\n<br>\n<br>Eco Companion has a big goal: to become a global leader in travel and change the world for the better along the way through delivering the highest standards in sustainability and ecotourism! If this gets you pumped and excited then this could be the family for you!\n<br>\n<br>Read more about us here: https://www.ecocompanion.com/about_us\n<br>Read more about our world rating system here: https://www.ecocompanion.com/world_rating_system \n<br>\n<br>__Outcomes__\n<br>Build our business based around our KPIs. In particular driving overall bookings through the site. We’re currently still burning cash each month so are in the process of trying to cut away at that through delivering more and more sales (selling holidays).\n<br>Manage our content marketing strategy using our content calendar.\n<br>Manage all of our social networks including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.\n<br>Manage our ever-growing email mailing list.\n<br>Conduct regular user research to develop the website, our product, to become more and more effective. \n<br>\n<br>__Role-based Competencies__\n<br>Scientific mind. Constantly look to be creating tests and analysing results to deliver sustainable continuous improvement.\n<br>Salesman in copy. Be able to write to directly appeal to a specific audience, in order to generate sales for each ad you create or interaction you have with our audience.\n<br>Organisation. Be able to manage your own time effectively, managing a complex content strategy.\n<br>Creativity. Be unique! Come up with interesting alternative ways to solve problems and write pattern interrupting copy so we’re a step above the rest! \n<br>People-person. Be able to deal with, and relate to other people, and understand what people want.\n<br>Resourcefulness. You won’t have a big budget, so you’ll need to be resourceful and deliver results without lots of cash at your disposal!\n<br>\n<br>__Culture-based Competencies__\n<br>Ambition. Aspiring to achieve something great from your life rather than settling and stagnating. You don’t join a startup to make gradual incremental increases in salary. You do it to change the fucking world and make something of yourself along the way! \n<br>Hard work ethic. Always trying to push yourself beyond your comfort zone, working sometimes long hours to get the job done.\n<br>Curiosity. Eager to learn and develop yourself and your skill sets constantly. In particular through consuming content as a daily habit through reading, audio books, blogs etc.\n<br>Positivity. Maintain a positive mind-set, and a ‘can-do’ attitude.\n<br>Innovative. Always introducing new ideas, original and creative in your thinking.\n<br>Long-term visionary. Think of the long term mission and goals of the business and how each decision ties into them.\n<br>Selfless. Always willing to sacrifice personal gains for the best interest of the team.\n<br>\n<br>__Essential hard skills and experience required__\n<br>At least two years experience in a marketing based role already.\n<br>At least some basic knowledge of the travel industry. (Don’t tell me you travel a lot! ;) ).\n<br>Experience with Google Analytics.\n<br>Experience with Adwords.\n<br>Experience with social media marketing.\n<br>Experience with managing a content marketing strategy.\n<br>High standard of written English.\n<br>Experience of using Google docs and Microsoft Office. In particular you need to be proficient with Excel.\n<br>\n<br>__Bonus points__\n<br>Experience in the travel industry.\n<br>Experience in e-commerce.\n<br>Experience in particular with growth hacking.\n<br>Worked in startups.\n<br>Used Slack / Trello.\n<br>A level of understanding/knowledge about ecotourism, or other sector specific knowledge.\n<br>Personal experience of nature tourism, conservation projects, etc (beyond that you went travelling that one time).",

For us, this means rethinking what it takes to design, build and launch the next generation of digital health products and services—whether their goal is improving patient care, treatment compliance, clinical diagnostics or surgical precision—these are serious challenges, and they need seriously good solutions.</p>\n <p>More than a consultancy, we’re also an in-house product team—we are effectively building and launching new startup propositions for our clients and ourselves. To do this we need an amazing team of designers, engineers, strategists, and roles we haven’t even created yet.</p>\n <p>We don’t work like an agency, or a consultancy, or even a product studio. We work with our clients as if we were part of their team. We join them in the trenches. We treat the unseen aspects of their product as if they were on full display. We go above and beyond the brief to maximise the impact and success they have on the market and the users they serve.</p>\n <p>To live up to this, everyone in our team relentlessly drives towards the same goal—to improve the health and wellbeing of people all over the world.</p>\n <p>If that lights a fire in your belly, come on board.</p>\n <p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></p>\n <p>You’ll be the custodian of everything the user touches—defending their interests and needs (to the death) and solving serious design challenges with elegant, intuitive and, if needs be, unconventional solutions, with a touch of personal flair. In practical terms, you’ll be working on greenfield projects, collaborating closely with UX directors, art directors and the best engineers, strategists and “tier 1” clients to create engaging user experiences; building prototypes, designing beautiful and polished interfaces, leading other designers, and helping ensure smooth handovers.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You use design best practices that work – You have great taste in interfaces. You keep abreast of what works and what doesn’t as our medium continues to evolve. You can instantly recognise the tools and methods required to achieve results in any given situation.</li>\n  <li>You can work fast, and slow – Having worked in both fast-paced start-up environments and more process-driven corporate settings, you understand how to balance lean design principles with corporate governance and signoff processes.</li>\n  <li>You’re willing and able to go beyond the conventional – Digital products can lack personality, style and risk-taking. We never compromise accessibility or performance but we do push the creative boundaries of what’s possible to create unique, engaging experiences. You’re not only comfortable with this but crave the opportunity to create original concepts and new UI systems.</li>\n  <li>You’ve found balance – You know how to balance a product’s design with what your peers would applaud and what your client and their users really need. You know when to strive for pixel perfect, when good is good enough, and when polished interactions and animations serve a purpose, and when they are simply a pursuit of vanity.</li>\n  <li>You have a sharp eye for detail – You have highly developed organisational skills and the ability to prioritise tasks. You strive for quality not only in your final deliverables but also in the working assets you use along the way.</li>\n  <li>You over-communicate with the team about your priorities, choices, tradeoffs, and the rationale behind the design decisions you take.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>You’ll have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Several years experience in product design with experience leading other designers</li>\n  <li>A portfolio of projects that you can talk us through: the end result, the process you took, trade-offs you had to make, the inspiration and design systems you used</li>\n  <li>A deep understanding and appreciation of the various design systems and guidelines that dominate app and web interfaces, and where and when they should be used</li>\n  <li>Strong UX capabilities: you’re able to interrogate and understand a product’s users and commercial goals and make sure our work drives towards these</li>\n  <li>Expert UI skills: you have a rich understanding of UI principles and can apply these to polished, interactive designs</li>\n  <li>A proactive mindset: if there’s something you don’t understand, or a task/process tweak that’s needed, you seek to address it rather than relying on others to</li>\n  <li>Fluency in spoken and written English: accents are fine, but we work on tricky projects across multiple time zones so great communication is a must</li>\n  <li><strong>Willingness to get overlap with the team: they’ll be on a European time zone, so you’ll need to arrange for at least 4 hours of overlap each day</strong></li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Bonus if you also have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Experience doing all of the above 100% remotely!</strong></li>\n  <li>Achieved mastery of; type hierarchies, interaction language, intuitive navigation, modality, card-based component design, and data visualisation</li>\n  <li>Knowledge and experience of designing products for patients and clinicians</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://hanno.co/careers/senior-product-designer/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

We provide smart solutions centred around protection and functionality that hold design and craft at their core. We’ve grown from a guerrilla crowdfunding campaign to an internationally recognised brand, shipping to almost every country in the world. We’ve made it our mission to disrupt the saturated lifestyle accessory market, whilst constantly pushing the boundaries of what it means to be an engaging brand. We knew that in order to achieve this, our products needed to be three things: stylish, functional and protective. After months and months spent designing and testing, we created our unique AiroShock technology and paired it with raw materials to launch our signature Limitless case.\n<br>\n<br>…that was in 2016. Since then, we have rapidly developed and expanded our product range, offering a multitude of cases with an array of add-ons!

Our products enable businesses to understand their customers, find future prospects, and personalize how they communicate.</p>\n <p>Today, Clearbit powers more than 1,500 enterprise customers and 500,000 individual marketers, engineers, and sales reps. It’s an exciting time to join Clearbit. We’re a profitable, rapidly growing SaaS company (&gt; 100% ARR last year), full of can-do people who care about craft, collaboration, and our customers.</p>\n <p>We’re looking for a creative marketer and sharp writer to help Clearbit communicate value to its customers, prospects, and the world — from developing Clearbit company and product narratives to providing resources for helping busy marketing and sales teams thrive in their jobs.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Role</strong><br>As a Lifecycle Content Marketer, you’ll work closely with our Head of Content and be part of our scrappy growth team. The team works across 5 realms — conversion, analytics, demand, product marketing, and content — which led to the idea that we’re like a Captain Planet team, with different expertise areas coming together to create great work. Content is Earth — creating foundational resources to help us grow. (If you’re interested in this team, you hopefully enjoy a little metaphor.)</p>\n <p>Content at Clearbit is not driven by eyeballs, which is, let’s face it, a little gross. We want to connect with the brains and emotions of actual, whole people — to educate and inspire, make them go “aha!” and go think and work on something they read about. To do so, you’ll be writing and creating collateral around how to use data to do better sales and marketing.</p>\n <p><strong>Here’s an idea for some of the things you’ll be doing:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Create useful content that will help Clearbit become a go-to resource for our target communities and customers.</strong> You’ll create blog posts, email copy, and other collateral — as well as experiment with different formats and mediums — to help inform, encourage, and market to customers across different stages of their lifecycle. This might involve managing and editing contributions from other employees, freelancers, partners, and community members.</li>\n  <li><strong>Drive distribution, according to team and company goals:</strong> Part of the job of creating content is telling people that it exists. Otherwise, it’s the whole tree falling in the forest thing. Promotion and distribution tasks may include creating newsletters, using social media, or coming up with experiment ideas.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep us on message: </strong>You’ll pitch in to wordsmith marketing copy and review content for clarity and brand consistency, style, tone, and voice across the company. For instance, you might be pulled in to provide feedback on a survey or to copy edit a presentation. Writing is hard! And you’ll be one of our resident experts.</li>\n  <li><strong>Help us learn and grow through reporting and analysis. </strong>Again, content here isn’t driven by vanity metrics but we are informed by data to understand how we’re doing and how we can improve. Our content (and overall growth team) strategies are always rooted in specific business and quarterly goals — so it’s good to know the health of how we’re doing. Currently we use tools like Google Analytics, Mode, and Tableau — have support from a super analytics team.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What will you bring to the table?</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>You’re an excellent writer and editor. </strong>You can explain complex concepts clearly, tell a compelling story, and write with personality. You think editing is integral to the writing process.</li>\n  <li><strong>You have a history of marketing or editorial success. </strong>Ideally you experienced some of that success working for a SaaS or media company. We’re looking for someone who can show how they’ve had a direct hand in building an audience, helping customers succeed, teaching and educating, and/or moving hearts, minds, (and wallets).</li>\n  <li><strong>Your content is deliberate</strong> — driven by an understanding of why it’s being created and who it serves. You’re opinionated when it comes to making decisions about what makes content interesting or helpful — and how it fits in strategically. You’re a believer in talking with and knowing your audience.</li>\n  <li><strong>You’re curious and quick to learn</strong>, and you love to do so through the writing process. We’re not necessarily looking for someone to come in the door with domain expertise, but you’re eager to dive in, talk to people, do research, and then share what you’ve learned. You like to ask questions like “why?” and “what if?” and follow through to find the answers.</li>\n  <li><strong>You thrive when able to self-direct.</strong> You’re looking to work with a startup where you’ll be responsible for the impact you make and have a lot of freedom. The growth team is fully remote, so you work well with autonomy and are a proactive communicator.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>When applying, please include:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>A description of your work history (whether as a resume, LinkedIn profile, or prose)</li>\n  <li>Links to a portfolio or at least 3 writing samples</li>\n  <li>This <em>is</em> a content position — a great cover letter will help you make your case</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/clearbit/28d77eba-55a0-4dd0-b256-7a3c2853945c' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

If you’re passionate about the craft and process of building an exciting product from the ground up and working with great people, you’ll fit right in.\n<br>\n<br>Who are we?\n<br>-------------\n<br>CreditDigital allows vendors to provide an instant finance option to their business customers at online checkout or point-of-sale. Business customers can then design their own terms to fit their budget and cashflow. We are trying to solve a massive problem in the B2B world and we are very excited to be amongst the first ones tackling it.\n<br>\n<br>What will you be doing?\n<br>------------------------\n<br>As the first designer in the company, you will have the opportunity to set up the standards in how the design process works. As a product team, we trust each individual to be autonomous and work towards are shared goals. We are fully committed in supporting one another in any way possible.\n<br>\n<br>* Act as a champion that drives product ideas from start to completion: from research insights, to workflows all the way to visual designs.\n<br>* Sketch and prototype ideas to quickly access viability, and design the fine grained details of interactions.\n<br>* Iterate based on feedback from the whole team.\n<br>* Work closely with engineers as they build and ship ideas.\n<br>\n<br>What skills and experience do I need?\n<br>------------------------------------\n<br>We are looking for product designers that have done this before. You will be designer #1 which is very exciting and you will get to set the tone of our product.\n<br>\n<br>* Experience designing digital products and systems (styleguides), not just websites. You have helped ship products.\n<br>* An appreciation of the entire product development process, from problem solving through to detailed UI and visual design.\n<br>* The ability to create mockups of your designs.\n<br>* Excellent communicator that can articulate the thought behind proposals.\n<br>* Able to collaborate with the engineers and the wider company on strategy and delivery.\n<br>\n<br>Where will I be working from?\n<br>-----------------------------\n<br>Normally you will be working from our Angel offices (right next to the station) but we are a remote friendly bunch so you can adjust your schedule as you see fit.\n<br>\n<br>What would I be paid?\n<br>----------------------\n<br>Our pay is within the top 10% of the industry, for the matched role and experience, based on London rates. According to the market at the moment, we aim to pay £70,000 for the role.\n<br>\n<br>Salary is not everything. Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived away from work. We don't offer free beers or Coke on tap but rather:\n<br>\n<br>* 25 days off per annum plus bank holidays.\n<br>* 35 hours / week. Normal working hours are between 10am – 6pm.\n<br>* Work from home whenever. If you prefer to come to the office everyday that’s great, if you prefer to work from home 4 times a week that’s fantastic. Whatever works for you. As a team we will make sure you are not missing out by pushing remote first practices. Flexibility to adjust your daily hours. Visiting friends and family in another country, going to the bank or the gym, you only need to have an overlap between our core hours (12am – 4pm) for 6 hours. As an example, you can start at 8am and finish at 4pm or 12am and finish at 8pm.\n<br>\n<br>How to apply?\n<br>--------------\n<br>Where you have previously worked does not really matter. If you have a Linkedin profile, just to have a more general idea, send it through, no CV is needed in that case. Instead, send us through a cover letter where you explain more about your experience. We would like you to express:\n<br>\n<br>* What have you worked on that you are the most proud of?\n<br>* What do you enjoy working on the most?\n<br>* How do you approach the design process?\n<br>* What would you like to work on here?\n<br>\n<br>In the interview process we will go through a particular piece of work (your choice) that you have delivered, detailing the approach around it, challenges and learnings. We're looking for a feature/research that clearly outlines the problems you were tackling with your design work. It should touch on the process you applied to tackling the challenges, rather than focusing just on visuals and landing pages. We would like to go through from inception to interactions and the visual design. The work should ideally focus on designing software products.\n<br>\n<br>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company.",
