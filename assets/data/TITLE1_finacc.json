We are a highly energetic, positive, resourceful team working virtually across the globe. We believe that executional excellence is key to success.</p><p>At Greenback, we provide you with the tools that you need to be successful and we bring our clients to you so that you can focus on preparing expat taxes and providing exceptional customer care!</p><p>This is not a traditional JOB- it’s more like a business partnership- and is ideally suited for those folks who love the idea of their earning potential being tied to their individual accomplishments, are obsessively organized and have a natural flair for customer care.</p><p><strong>What we’re looking for:</strong></p><ul><li>CPAs or EAs with 3-5 years of experience preparing US expat tax returns, including specific experience with the additional forms and schedules required for expats (1116, 2555, FinCen 114, 5471, 3520, etc.)</li><li>People who are comfortable managing their own schedule and workload. There are no set hours- you get paid for the work you do and your results. You take on as many customers as you choose (we pre-agree annual targets)</li><li>People who see technology as an enabler and embrace it fully. We use state of the art systems (Salesforce, Box, ProSeries, and Lacerte).</li><li>People who are extremely organized, especially in managing around deadlines. This is a deadline-driven business, so anyone who gets frazzled near a tax deadline or disorganized will struggle.</li><li>Strong attention to detail. Mistakes on tax returns are not cool. We need people who make sure there’s never an error or an oversight.</li></ul><p><strong>Why work with Greenback?</strong></p><ul><li>Again, this is not a traditional 9 to 5. No one has set hours- you have specific responsibilities and obligations related to timeliness of customer care, but it’s up to you to set a schedule that meets those timings.</li><li><strong>No office/no commute.</strong>&nbsp;You have ultimate&nbsp;<strong>flexibility</strong>&nbsp;to decide where you work from and when you work. Want to spend tax season in your home office and the slower season working a lighter load from Mexico or Bali or the coast of Spain? Many on our team do just that.</li><li>You get paid directly in proportion to how many tax returns you complete. Your earning potential is unlimited and a good number of the accountants on our team earn six figures. However, this is also very personal and is directly in relation to your skillset. If you’re a hustler, have high expertise in US expat tax prep, work hard and stay organized, this is a great opportunity for you.</li><li>We have frequent bonus opportunities for excellence in staying organized, timeliness and attention to detail. We’ve heard our accountants described as&nbsp;<strong>personal tax time hero’s</strong>-we compensate accountants above the standard per return pay for above and beyond customer care</li><li>This opportunity is an ideal fit for people who are happy to work on their own, but don’t want to manage the business logistics like marketing, customer acquisition, billing, customer service, etc</li><li>We’re maniacal about customer care- we expect everyone to have an experience with us that makes them want to go straight out and tell their friends how wonderful Greenback is. Accountants who feel that’s important thrive with us and love how happy their customers are at the end of each tax season.</li><li>You will have&nbsp;<strong>access to a peer group of 30+ accountants</strong>&nbsp;that are the best in the industry in regards to not just US expat taxes, but also customer centricity.</li></ul><p>And the best news is- we’re hiring! The business is growing rapidly, and we’re looking to staff 5-10 more accountants this year alone. Apply today!!! To apply, take the following steps:</p><ul><li>Fill out our online assessment (see link below!)</li><li>Attach to the online form not only your resume/CV, but also a cover letter</li></ul><p>We will follow up with all candidates within 5 working days with next steps.</p><p><strong>Location: United States<br>Candidates can be based anywhere in the world, this position is virtual/work from home.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/jobs/expat-tax-accountant/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Our company culture is constantly evolving, every person who joins us adds something unique to our culture. But our values are shared by all Shield GEO employees. Do these values resonate with you?</p><h5><strong>Grow</strong></h5><p>We believe that personal growth and company growth go hand in hand. We look to foster our own growth and help grow the company. Every day is an opportunity to face a new challenge and get a little better. In our world of international employment it is impossible to know all the answers. Instead of trying to know everything, we focus on knowing how to solve problems. When mistakes happen we know it’s all part of the learning curve and we seek feedback to help us improve. We keep an eye on the big picture so we can identify improvements to processes and systems. As the problems become larger and more complex, it means that we’ll need more flexible and agile minds to come up with solutions.</p><h5><strong>Own It</strong></h5><p>We are self-motivated and love to see tasks to completion. Our managers and team mates are often in different time zones, and that’s ok! We aren’t afraid to step up when things get a little tough. We don’t like to micro-manage or&nbsp;be&nbsp;micromanaged. We trust our team mates to carry out their part of the process. We are responsible for our own workload and making sure we get our most important things done each day. If we get stuck we proactively seek help. And we show our reliability and accountability by keeping our systems updated. This also means our results can speak for themselves.</p><h5><strong>Do The Right Thing</strong></h5><p>Our clients trust us with compliance on their most important asset – their employees. This is a big responsibility! Doing the right thing means often times we choose a harder path and see it through to the end. It means we are open with our colleagues, clients and suppliers about bad news just the same as we share good news. And sometimes doing the right thing means we have to make decisions that will upset the very person we are trying to help. It’s a high standard but we stand by this very strongly. Doing the right thing also means considering how our actions impact those around us.</p><h5><strong>Be Human</strong></h5><p>We are a service business and helping people is at the core of everything we do. We pride ourselves on how we interact with colleagues, service providers and clients. We recognize that in all areas we’re dealing with real humans.<br>We know that working remotely and dealing with such a mix of people around the world is challenging. We know that if we are having trouble understanding someone, they are also struggling to understand us. Empathy is fundamental to helping us discover what people mean and how they are feeling. To avoid misinterpretation we assume best intent in others.<br>Because so much of our communication is written and asynchronous, we default to&nbsp;<em>over-communication</em>. This means we give extra details because we don’t leave people guessing. We make sure our words are clear and easy to understand. And we are kind to our fellow humans.</p><h5><strong>Your Background</strong></h5><ul><li>At least two to three years’ experience within Finance</li><li>International tax or payroll experience strongly preferred. It will be helpful if you are familiar with concepts like employer social security, foreign exchange, gross ups and expense reimbursements.</li><li>Comfortable with technology. We are mostly remote and that means we rely on a bunch of applications to keep connected. That means video conferences (Zoom), chat and messaging (Slack, Skype and Salesforce Chatter), shared documents (Dropbox). You’ll likely be working by yourself during parts of your day without access to tech support.</li><li>Experience with Salesforce or Xero is helpful but not essential.</li></ul><h5><strong>Essential Characteristics of this role</strong></h5><ul><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills and the ability to absorb information quickly.</li><li>Able to prioritize effectively and work autonomously while coordinating with an international team.</li><li>Exceptional attention to detail and maintaining accurate records.</li><li>Ideally located between UTC+3 and UTC+8 time zones</li><li>Some flexibility in working hours. We discourage overtime work and you will only be expected to work a standard number of hours each week. But we have clients and colleagues all over the world so sometimes you will need to be on calls in the morning or evening.</li><li>Request invoices from our providers located around the world</li><li>Create client invoices to cover the monthly payroll cost for each GEO employee</li><li>Request payslips from our providers around the work</li><li>Record and check payroll outputs within our systems to share with our clients</li><li>Record incoming payments and setup ongoing payments</li><li>Help to manage the team Accounts mailbox</li><li>Keep an accurate record of information in our internal systems by the process due dates</li><li>Check invoices for accuracy before sending to your clients</li></ul><h5><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h5><h6>Payroll and Invoicing</h6><h6>Process Improvement and Projects</h6><p>Everyone at Shield gets involved in projects. These can range from a simple creation of a template to speed up a task through to creating complex automations which eliminate hours of admin work.</p><ul><li>Assist the project team and other internal resources with recommending and implementing process and system improvements.</li><li>Act as a superuser in project teams</li><li>Help train other users when rolling out project solutions</li><li>Keep internal systems updated with progress on all core tasks</li><li>Weekly summary reporting</li><li>Ensure accuracy of all invoicing, payslip and payment data is entered in our internal CRM</li></ul><h6>Reporting</h6><h5><strong>Next Steps</strong></h5><p>If you like what you’re read so far, this is a fantastic opportunity to join a global team committed to service. We’d really like to hear from you!

Do these values resonate with you?</p><p><strong>Grow</strong></p><p>We believe that personal growth and company growth go hand in hand. We look to foster our own growth and help grow the company. Every day is an opportunity to face a new challenge and get a little better. In our world of international employment it is impossible to know all the answers. Instead of trying to know everything, we focus on knowing how to solve problems. When mistakes happen we know it’s all part of the learning curve and we seek feedback to help us improve. We keep an eye on the big picture so we can identify improvements to processes and systems. As the problems become larger and more complex, it means that we’ll need more flexible and agile minds to come up with solutions.</p><p><strong>Own It</strong></p><p>We are self-motivated and love to see tasks to completion. Our managers and teammates are often in different time zones, and that’s ok! We aren’t afraid to step up when things get a little tough. We don’t like to micro-manage or&nbsp;<strong>be</strong>&nbsp;micromanaged. We trust our teammates to carry out their part of the process. We are responsible for our own workload and making sure we get our most important things done each day. If we get stuck we proactively seek help. And we show our reliability and accountability by keeping our systems updated. This also means our results can speak for themselves.</p><p><strong>Do The Right Thing</strong></p><p>Our clients trust us with compliance on their most important asset – their employees. This is a big responsibility! Doing the right thing means often times we choose a harder path and see it through to the end. It means we are open with our colleagues, clients and suppliers about bad news just the same as we share good news. And sometimes doing the right thing means we have to make decisions that will upset the very person we are trying to help. It’s a high standard but we stand by this very strongly. Doing the right thing also means considering how our actions impact those around us.</p><p><strong>Be Human</strong></p><p>We are a service business and helping people is at the core of everything we do. We pride ourselves on how we interact with colleagues, service providers and clients. We recognize that in all areas we’re dealing with real humans. We know that working remotely and dealing with such a mix of people around the world is challenging. We know that if we are having trouble understanding someone, they are also struggling to understand us. Empathy is fundamental to helping us discover what people mean and how they are feeling. To avoid misinterpretation we assume best intent in others. Because so much of our communication is written and asynchronous, we default to&nbsp;<em>over-communication</em>. This means we give extra details because we don’t leave people guessing. We make sure our words are clear and easy to understand. And we are kind to our fellow humans.</p><p><strong>Your Background</strong></p><ul><li>At least two to three years’ experience within Finance</li><li>International tax or payroll experience strongly preferred. It will be helpful if you are familiar with concepts like employer social security, foreign exchange, gross ups and expense reimbursements.</li><li>Comfortable with technology. We are mostly remote and that means we rely on a bunch of applications to keep connected. That means video conferences (Zoom), chat and messaging (Slack, Skype and Salesforce Chatter), shared documents (Dropbox). You’ll likely be working by yourself during parts of your day without access to tech support.</li><li>Experience with Salesforce or Xero is helpful but not essential.</li></ul><p><strong>Essential Characteristics of this role</strong></p><ul><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills and the ability to absorb information quickly.</li><li>Able to prioritize effectively and work autonomously while coordinating with an international team.</li><li>Exceptional attention to detail and maintaining accurate records.</li><li>Ideally located between UTC+3 and UTC+8 time zones</li><li>Some flexibility in working hours. We discourage overtime work and you will only be expected to work a standard number of hours each week. But we have clients and colleagues all over the world so sometimes you will need to be on calls in the morning or evening.</li><li>Request invoices from our providers located around the world</li><li>Create client invoices to cover the monthly payroll cost for each GEO employee</li><li>Request payslips from our providers around the work</li><li>Record and check payroll outputs within our systems to share with our clients</li><li>Record incoming payments and setup ongoing payments</li><li>Help to manage the team Accounts mailbox</li><li>Keep an accurate record of information in our internal systems by the process due dates</li><li>Check invoices for accuracy before sending to your clients</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Payroll and Invoicing Process Improvement and Projects</p><p>Everyone at Shield gets involved in projects. These can range from a simple creation of a template to speed up a task through to creating complex automations which eliminate hours of admin work.</p><ul><li>Assist the project team and other internal resources with recommending and implementing process and system improvements.</li><li>Act as a superuser in project teams</li><li>Help train other users when rolling out project solutions</li><li>Keep internal systems updated with progress on all core tasks</li><li>Weekly summary reporting</li><li>Ensure accuracy of all invoicing, payslip and payment data is entered in our internal CRM</li><li>Reporting</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://shield-geo.breezy.hr/p/140fe3fe0223?source=remote.co' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
