There are no set hours- you get paid for the work you do and your results.

We use state of the art systems (Salesforce, Box, ProSeries, and Lacerte).</li><li>People who are extremely organized, especially in managing around deadlines. This is a deadline-driven business, so anyone who gets frazzled near a tax deadline or disorganized will struggle.</li><li>Strong attention to detail. Mistakes on tax returns are not cool.

Want to spend tax season in your home office and the slower season working a lighter load from Mexico or Bali or the coast of Spain? Many on our team do just that.</li><li>You get paid directly in proportion to how many tax returns you complete. Your earning potential is unlimited and a good number of the accountants on our team earn six figures. However, this is also very personal and is directly in relation to your skillset. If you’re a hustler, have high expertise in US expat tax prep, work hard and stay organized, this is a great opportunity for you.</li><li>We have frequent bonus opportunities for excellence in staying organized, timeliness and attention to detail. We’ve heard our accountants described as <strong>“personal tax time hero’s”</strong>-we compensate accountants above the standard per return pay for above and beyond customer care</li><li>This opportunity is an ideal fit for people who are happy to work on their own, but don’t want to manage the business logistics like marketing, customer acquisition, billing, customer service, etc</li><li>We’re maniacal about customer care- we expect everyone to have an experience with us that makes them want to go straight out and tell their friends how wonderful Greenback is. Accountants who feel that’s important thrive with us and love how happy their customers are at the end of each tax season.</li><li>You will have <strong>access to a peer group of 30+ accountants</strong> that are the best in the industry in regards to not just US expat taxes, but also customer centricity.</li></ul><div>And the best news is- we’re hiring!
