Poverty-Environment Action builds on the deep experience of the UNDPUN Environment Poverty-Environment Initiative (PEI). Over the past decade, PEI has pioneered integrated approaches to mainstreaming poverty-environment linkages in national development planning and implementation processesfirst in support of national efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and now as a model for implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p><p>By building on PEI’s legacy, PEA is uniquely placed to ensure that the environmental dimension is not left behind when addressing poverty. Leveraging broader 2030 Agenda and SDG implementation processes provides new entry points not only to mainstream environmental sustainability and related climate concerns for poverty eradication, but also to gradually shift government priorities and resource allocation towards addressing these issues. Further, it provides opportunities to improve the quality of private sector investments to support poverty-environment objectives. This represents the new focus of PEA aligning finance and investment with poverty, environment and climate objectives to accelerate SDG implementation.</p><p>PEA assists government decision-makers and a wide range of other stakeholders seeking to manage the environment in a way that improves livelihoods and leads to investments in sustainable growth that ensures economic growth and poverty reduction initiatives are not at the expense of the environment, with an overall aim to bring about lasting institutional change and to increase investment in pro-poor environmental and natural resource management.</p><p>UNDP serves as the Managing Agent for the PEA project administration under the guidance and supervision of the UNDP PEA Project Manager/Director of UNDP Global Policy Centre on Resilient Ecosystems and Desertification (GC-RED), PEA Project Management Specialist, and in collaboration with UNDP HQ BPPS/ROM, BMS (as needed) and GC-RED (Nairobi) operations staff. Special attention is given to the proper financial set-up of PEA particularly during the first year, to ensure the project is properly set-up and managed according to PEA’S multi-donor action agreement as well as UNDP’s rules and regulation. Part of the Poverty-Environment Initiative’s (PEA’s predecessor project) final evaluation recommendation was to set-up a financial management structure and procedures under PEA in a cost-efficient manner and to further train participating country project staff on the set-up and implementation of PEA activities at country level. In that regard, the Finance Consultant will be essential in not only successfully setting up PEA’s financial management structure, but to further provide guidance and train Country Office finance staff on the proper financial management of PEA funds, in particular when it comes to EU funds regulations.</p><p><strong>Supervision;</strong></p><p>The Finance Consultant will report to PEA’s Project Management Specialist.</p><p><strong>The application should contain;</strong></p><ul><li>Detailed Curriculum Vitae;</li><li>Proposal/ methodology for implementing the assignment ;</li><li>Financial proposal that indicates an all inclusive fee in USD.</li></ul><p>The successful applicant will be required to complete a UNDP Personal History Form (P11) form prior to contracting.</p><p><strong>Duties and Responsibilities</strong></p><p><strong>Purpose and Scope of Activity;</strong></p><p>The purpose of this assignment is to generate the essential quality business and financial operations analysis and information for UNDP to undertake necessary quality assurance as part of the Managing Agent function.</p><p>More precisely, the Finance Consultant is expected to complete the following tasks;</p><p><strong>Scope of Activity;</strong></p><ul><li>Ensure proper set-up and financial management of PEA;</li><li>Develop training materials, provide guidance and conduct training to PEA finance staff on the implementation of PEA funds;</li><li>Develop PEA financial management lessons learned.</li></ul><p><strong>Expected deliverables;</strong></p><ul><li>Generate, analyze and verify the project financial reporting inputs (Annual, Donor and Progress Project) and create best practices (69 days);</li><li>Develop training guidelines for PEA country finance teams on PEA financial implementation and conduct training on PEA financial management and use of funds according to donor agreements specific to PEA (15 days);</li><li>Generate, analyze and provide financial management updates and reports on financial project progress to senior management and donors to inform decision making (36 days);</li></ul><ul><li>Generate financial business processes mapping and lessons learned to ensure proper management of financial transactions (15 days);</li><li>Ensure financial closure of PEI outputs and document the process of transitioning from PEI to PEA as a means of lessons learned.
