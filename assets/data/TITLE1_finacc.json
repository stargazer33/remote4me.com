Reporting directly to our CEO, you will work cross-functionally on critical processes that drive the success of Aptible. You’ll assume operational responsibilities that, to date, have been executed by our Leadership Team, and turn them into a well-oiled machine that results in stronger growth and greater visibility into that growth.</p><p><strong>About Aptible</strong></p><p><strong>Our Vision</strong></p><p>We see a future where it’s easy to bring a great idea into the world using the internet, while respecting data security and privacy. The next generation of businesses will design security and privacy into their operating processes. If every business is going to be a software business, every business will need to be a security business.</p><p>We’re working to make information security a core competency of every startup. We envision a world in which startups have access to great information security, are empowered to focus on their businesses instead of on compliance, can scale faster and more efficiently, and are confident that they’re creating quality products.</p><p><strong>Our Values</strong></p><p><em>Commitment to the Team</em></p><p>We’re passionate about building a diverse team of talented people who accomplish great things together, regardless of where they are. We talk a lot about the science of high-performing teams and how to make Aptible the best environment to support that kind of team. If you love the mutual support and camaraderie of a strong team that wins together, we want to hear from you.</p><p><em>Commitment to Each Other</em></p><p>We commit to each other as individuals, one on one. We measure our commitments carefully and hold each other accountable, which means we’re able to deliver more for our colleagues and customers in the long run. We set only a few very clear, ambitious goals as a company each quarter, and talk about them constantly to reinforce focus. We make time to recognize, praise, and reward those who consistently deliver on their promises.</p><p><em>Commitment to The Mission</em></p><p>Startups are hard, and we expect challenges and missteps. We love winning, but most of all, we value getting back up and getting better at what we do. We are deeply motivated to build trust on the internet by empowering teams, and we respect grit and perseverance in furtherance of that mission.</p><p><em>Growth Over Perfection</em></p><p>We fail often and early, and learn from it. We talk about improving constantly. We praise those who give feedback early and often. We put effort into being good at giving feedback: When we give feedback, we make each other feel big, not small. This helps create an environment where we can take reasonable risks, which in turn helps us make decisions quickly and learn fast. We expect managers to delegate a lot, and acknowledge that delegation means sometimes letting someone make what you think is the wrong decision.</p><p><em>Teaching as Learning</em></p><p>We are a team of learners. We value and respect teaching as the best way to learn, and make time to share information openly. We set explicit goals around training, and devote resources to developing and improving our internal training. We praise those who share knowledge in public — by asking and answering questions in team chat, writing documentation, and writing for our customers.</p><p><em>Taking Responsibility Over Giving Responsibility</em></p><p>Identifying problems is a good start, but we love solving them more. We think and talk a lot about how we can improve, and work hard at it. We value and reward those who take initiative. We don’t like meetings where we only talk about problems.</p><p><em>Asking Why</em></p><p>We ask “why?” a lot in order to understand root causes. Asking why helps us cultivate focus and make high-quality decisions quickly. We don’t attribute mistakes to human error. We view them as a starting point for an inquiry, not the end.</p><p><strong>Your Impact</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Near-Term</strong>: Your initial focus will be to help the Executive Team make better budgeting and strategic decisions — evaluating runway and burn, and testing different cash flow scenarios.</li><li>You’ll clean up our accounting processes, turning our monthly expense reporting, budgeting, and close processes into a machine.</li><li>You’ll take the results of our accounting processes and create forecasts and scenario tests that will guide strategic decision making across the company.</li><li>You’ll update the company with budget vs. actuals for key metrics summarizing the health of the business.</li><li>You’ll help us to compose regular investor updates and prepare pitch decks and other ad hoc investor communication.</li><li>You’ll work to streamline associated processes, such as dunning, tax, vendor payments, payroll, state registrations, sales deal desk.</li><li><strong>Long-Term</strong>: Once you’ve established our Accounting and Finance processes, we’ll grow the team provide you additional leverage so that you can take on the next strategic project. Examples of BizOps Initiatives:</li><li>You’ll conduct pricing research to determine if/how Aptible should revise its pricing model.</li><li>You’ll implement a new analytics system to track critical events within the user lifecycle and providing clear, succinct dashboards that the entire company can use to drive decision making.</li><li>You’ll evaluate and implement a potential multi-million dollar operational cost savings that could extend runway by 12 Months or more.</li></ul><p><strong>Your Strengths</strong></p><ul><li><em>Accounting and Finance Experience</em><strong>: </strong>You’ve successfully built out and run Accounting and Finance for a growing B2B SaaS Company for 5-10+ years. You’re ready to use your experience to help us level up quickly and, in turn, you’ll be able to move to broader, more strategic projects.</li><li><em>Knowledge of SaaS Metrics</em>: You understand how to calculate common SaaS Metrics, such as MRR, CLV, CAC, Churn, etc.</li><li><em>Strong Understanding of Value</em>: You excel at finding the right metric to optimize, then driving optimization.</li><li><em>Focus on Pragmatism and Velocity</em><strong>:</strong> You’re excited about rolling up your sleeves and getting stuff done in the unstructured environment of a hyper-growth technology startup.</li><li><em>Detail Orientedness</em>: You know how to find discrepancies between two CSVs, and can spot where a process is brittle or prone to error. You build checks into your analyses, and have experience working in a role where you were responsible for giving attention to detail.</li><li><em>Problem Solving Skills</em>: You have experience analyzing data to understand trends and develop recommendations for action. You have experience analyzing root causes and identifying creative solutions to complex business problems we may not have encountered before.</li><li><em>Process Design Skills</em><strong>: </strong>You have experience building systems, driving their successful implementation and adoption, and documenting them well.</li><li><em>Project Management Skills</em><strong>: </strong>You have experience running several projects at once in a dynamic environment. You’re comfortable working collaboratively with multiple stakeholders, taking initiative to move projects forward and deliver results on time.</li><li><em>Verbal and Written Communication Skills</em><strong>: </strong>You enjoy actively listening to and communicating with people to understand their needs and gain their trust. You have experience drafting clear communications that demonstrate discretion, good judgement, and attention to detail.</li><li><em>Bonus Experience (Not Required)</em>: You’re familiar with our operational stack, which includes Salesforce, Stripe, AWS, Expensify, and Quickbooks. You are experienced in SQL, and are comfortable with our analytics stack (Mode, dbt, PostgreSQL).</li></ul><p><strong>Our Benefits</strong></p><ul><li><strong><em>Work from Anywhere</em>: Enjoy the flexibility of working from home, a local co-working space, or your favorite coffee shop.</strong></li><li><em>Open Vacation Policy</em>: We encourage you to take the time you need, when you need it — for any holiday or matter of personal importance.</li><li><em>Paid Parental Leave</em>: We offer job-protected Paid Time Off — 12 Weeks, Fully Paid — for all parents to bond with a newly born, adopted, or fostered child.</li><li><em>Medical, Dental, and Vision Insurance</em>: We offer comprehensive health care for employees, with 100% of premiums paid by Aptible.</li><li><em>Hardware &amp; Software</em>: We help you create your ideal office setup and provide any software you’ll need.</li><li><em>Company Travel</em>: We come together in-person at least two to three times per year, in locations around the globe.</li></ul><p><strong>Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion</strong></p><p>We prioritize diversity within our team and value different perspectives, educational backgrounds, and life experiences. We encourage people from underrepresented backgrounds to apply.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/4e77fbba-cf5a-41ec-929f-b266c0ccd7ec' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

But we&rsquo;re also a team of dedicated (self-proclaimed) nerds, tech is what we know and love. So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

We are a highly energetic, positive, resourceful team working virtually across the globe. We believe that executional excellence is key to success.</p><p>At Greenback, we provide you with the tools that you need to be successful and we bring our clients to you so that you can focus on preparing expat taxes and providing exceptional customer care!</p><p>This is not a traditional JOB- it’s more like a business partnership- and is ideally suited for those folks who love the idea of their earning potential being tied to their individual accomplishments, are obsessively organized and have a natural flair for customer care.</p><p><strong>What we’re looking for:</strong></p><ul><li>CPAs or EAs with 3-5 years of experience preparing US expat tax returns, including specific experience with the additional forms and schedules required for expats (1116, 2555, FinCen 114, 5471, 3520, etc.)</li><li>People who are comfortable managing their own schedule and workload. There are no set hours- you get paid for the work you do and your results. You take on as many customers as you choose (we pre-agree annual targets)</li><li>People who see technology as an enabler and embrace it fully. We use state of the art systems (Salesforce, Box, ProSeries, and Lacerte).</li><li>People who are extremely organized, especially in managing around deadlines. This is a deadline-driven business, so anyone who gets frazzled near a tax deadline or disorganized will struggle.</li><li>Strong attention to detail. Mistakes on tax returns are not cool. We need people who make sure there’s never an error or an oversight.</li></ul><p><strong>Why work with Greenback?</strong></p><ul><li>Again, this is not a traditional 9 to 5. No one has set hours- you have specific responsibilities and obligations related to timeliness of customer care, but it’s up to you to set a schedule that meets those timings.</li><li><strong>No office/no commute.</strong>&nbsp;You have ultimate&nbsp;<strong>flexibility</strong>&nbsp;to decide where you work from and when you work. Want to spend tax season in your home office and the slower season working a lighter load from Mexico or Bali or the coast of Spain? Many on our team do just that.</li><li>You get paid directly in proportion to how many tax returns you complete. Your earning potential is unlimited and a good number of the accountants on our team earn six figures. However, this is also very personal and is directly in relation to your skillset. If you’re a hustler, have high expertise in US expat tax prep, work hard and stay organized, this is a great opportunity for you.</li><li>We have frequent bonus opportunities for excellence in staying organized, timeliness and attention to detail. We’ve heard our accountants described as&nbsp;<strong>personal tax time hero’s</strong>-we compensate accountants above the standard per return pay for above and beyond customer care</li><li>This opportunity is an ideal fit for people who are happy to work on their own, but don’t want to manage the business logistics like marketing, customer acquisition, billing, customer service, etc</li><li>We’re maniacal about customer care- we expect everyone to have an experience with us that makes them want to go straight out and tell their friends how wonderful Greenback is. Accountants who feel that’s important thrive with us and love how happy their customers are at the end of each tax season.</li><li>You will have&nbsp;<strong>access to a peer group of 30+ accountants</strong>&nbsp;that are the best in the industry in regards to not just US expat taxes, but also customer centricity.</li></ul><p>And the best news is- we’re hiring! The business is growing rapidly, and we’re looking to staff 5-10 more accountants this year alone. Apply today!!! To apply, take the following steps:</p><ul><li>Fill out our online assessment (see link below!)</li><li>Attach to the online form not only your resume/CV, but also a cover letter</li></ul><p>We will follow up with all candidates within 5 working days with next steps.</p><p><strong>Location: United States<br>Candidates can be based anywhere in the world, this position is virtual/work from home.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/jobs/expat-tax-accountant/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
