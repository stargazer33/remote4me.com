You’ve spent at least a few years building websites or apps, and you’ve got a foundational knowledge of software development because of it.</p><p>But somewhere along the way you realized that communication is the key to any software project — specifically, written communication. You understand the power of well-written technical content, but you also know the devil is in the details: you are no stranger to the challenges of accuracy, conciseness and relevance.</p><p>Alongside your development skills. you’ve probably honed your craft as a technical writer and editor through blog posts, documentation or something similar. Along the way you developed strong relationships with the people who inform your writing, because you know effective communication with them is key to your success.</p><p></p><strong>What</strong><p>As Editor-in-Chief for Twilio’s technical content, you will own the strategy for Twilio’s developer content across twilio.com and our other properties.</p><p>You’ll spend a good portion of your time writing for Twilio’s developer audience yourself, but you’ll more often find yourself collaborating with other teams across Twilio as they prepare content for our developer audience.</p><p>That content could be a refreshed landing page on twilio.com, a launch package of content for a new product, or a steady stream of blog posts and documentation to help us serve a community of developers we may have overlooked.</p><p>You’ll learn about the worlds of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and web analytics if you haven’t already. You’ll likely dive even deeper in your data analysis to help us spot opportunities to reach new developers or better serve those already in our audience.</p><p>On rare occasions, you’ll crack open your text editor and build a new feature for twilio.com when it’s necessary to support your content strategy.</p><p>Above all else, however, you’ll set the strategy for all of Twilio’s technical content and support every contributor at Twilio to be a part of it.</p><p></p><strong>Why</strong><p>Twilio’s mission is to fuel the future of communications.</p><p>The Developer Network is the team at Twilio whose mission is to catalyze the network of developers who will build the future of communications. The DevNet is comprised of three teams that work closely with one another. Developer Evangelists inspire and equip developers by going to the language-centric and geographic communities where developers gather. Developer Educators challenge and empower developers by crafting world-class docs and training. Community Developers encourage and amplify developers by cultivating a core community of Twilio developers. Together, these three teams introduce developers to Twilio, help them get their projects shipped and build strong end enduring friendships with them.</p><p>Twilio is a company committed to your growth, your learning, your development and your entire employee experience. We only win when our employees succeed and we’re dedicated to helping you develop your strengths. We have a cultural foundation built on diversity, inclusion and innovation that we believe only gets better when your ideas thrive.</p><p></p><strong>Where</strong><p>This is a remote position. You can be based in a major metro area. &nbsp;While working remote you will still enjoy our incredible perks: a free Kindle when you build your Twilio app, monthly Kindle book reimbursement, monthly gym reimbursement, bi-weekly All Hands and more. &nbsp;Because you will collaborate with many people in Twilio HQ, you may need to travel to our San Francisco office 1-2 times per quarter. We also believe that in order to do this job well, you need a balanced work and home life. &nbsp;We offer generous PTO. What you will also get to experience is a company that believes in small teams for maximum impact; that strives to balance work and home life, that understands that this is a marathon, not a sprint; that continuously and purposefully builds an inclusive culture where everyone is able to do and be the best version of themselves. We seek people who naturally demonstrate our values, who are challenged by problems, empower others to thrive, people who can draw the owl and not be beholden to one playbook.</p><p></p><strong>About us:</strong><p></p><em>More than 2 million developers around the world have used Twilio to unlock the magic of communications to improve any human experience. Twilio has democratized communications channels like voice, text, chat, and video by virtualizing the world’s telecommunications infrastructure through APIs that are simple enough for any developer to use, yet robust enough to power the world’s most demanding applications.
