    "content": "<p><strong>About WBECS</strong></p><p>Imagine being a key part of the team behind the world’s largest online event for professional</p><p>Coaches. The World Business &amp; Executive Coach Summit (WBECS) takes place every year and is</p><p>highly regarded by coaching professionals worldwide.</p><p>You’d be working with those who coach the elite of the business world - names like Richard</p><p>Branson, Steve Jobs, and Elon Musk. Development experts who guide companies like NASA and</p><p>World Bank to greatness - those are the coaches we work with personally to help get their amazing</p><p>thought leadership out to the world.</p><p>Due to our fast growth, we are looking for an exceptional new Copywriter to join us.</p><p>We run the largest online event for coaches (<a href='http://www.wbecs.com' rel='nofollow'>www.wbecs.com</a>) with 50 of the top thought leaders</p><p>for the coaching industry, and in addition to this, we also launch individual programmes such as</p><p>Narrative Coach and Conversational Intelligence for Coaches. We also have a philanthropic mission,</p><p>which takes the form of EthicalCoach (<a href='http://www.ethicalcoach.org' rel='nofollow'>www.ethicalcoach.org</a>).</p><p><strong>W O R L D B U S I N E S S A N D E X E C U T I V E C O A C H S U M M I T G R O U P</strong></p><p><strong>Copywriter</strong></p><p><em><strong>Our Mission and our Culture</strong></em></p><p>Our mission at WBECS is to raise the global standard of coaching by providing executive coaches</p><p>with the highest quality content available in the industry. WBECS is a growing remote global</p><p>workforce, we are truly passionate about our people!</p><p>This is not your typical office job. Our passionately-engaged, global team works 100% remotely and</p><p>collaborates vigorously. The lifestyle design is flexible but full on; and the culture is fast-paced. We</p><p>consider our work our “art”, striving for excellence in everything we do. &quot;We consider ourselves as</p><p>family and <a href='https://vimeo.com/319954647/da12bd951d' rel='nofollow'>here's</a> an inside look at some of the family fun.&quot; The lifestyle design is flexible, but full</p><p>on and the culture is fast-paced. We consider our work our “art” and strive for excellence in</p><p>everything we do.</p><p><strong>Our Programs</strong></p><p>Adjacent to the annual Summit event, WBECS runs a number of learning programs in collaboration</p><p>with some of the coaching industry’s most respected and revered principle players:</p><p>• Coach Master Toolkit© (CMT) with Andrew Neitlich</p><p>• Narrative Coach (NC) with Dr. David Drake</p><p>• Conversational Intelligence® for Coaches (C-IQ) with the late, great Judith E. Glaser</p><p>• Coaching with Return on Investment (ROI) with Lisa Ann Edwards</p><p>• EthicalCoach (EC) - our non-profit initiative with a team including Marshall Goldsmith</p><p>Each of these programs/projects has its own, subtly-nuanced tone of voice, which, as our new</p><p>Copywriter, you would have to learn to adapt and adhere to.</p><p><strong>Our Tone of Voice</strong></p><p>The tone we wish to strike with our coaching community is warm, friendly and inviting. We pride</p><p>ourselves on not patronizing our audience. Our copy is designed to make the coach the star - not</p><p>ourselves. Sentences are concise - we try not to string too many thoughts together at once to</p><p>illustrate our clear intent and the benefits they will enjoy. The content we write talks to our coaches</p><p>- not at them. This creates a sense of intelligent, educated people in conversation with one another.</p><p><em><strong>An overview of working for us</strong></em></p><p>Our busiest times are always when we are about to launch a new program or event. A lot of materials</p><p>need to be written and prepared weeks in advance of the launch date. This is when you will find</p><p>your ‘To Do’ list runs pretty high. For example, for the relaunch of Narrative Coach in early 2019, a</p><p>total of 163 emails needed to be drafted. Not to mention accompanying web pages, social media</p><p>posts, blog posts and so on - and that is just one program. As well as our existing programs and</p><p>events, we are also piloting and planning to launch new ones too.</p><p>We will ask you to work hard, fast and to the best of your ability. As long as you are fully prepared</p><p>to do that, you will find working for WBECS very rewarding. Perks far outweigh the pitfalls. We</p><p>gather together once a year for our annual Company Retreat, giving you the opportunity to travel to</p><p>some spectacular locations.

We found that people don’t need to have used a product to be happy to recommend it for a reward. In this way, businesses are missing out on non-customer referrals as a rich source of new customers.<br /><br />Nettle’s solution is a platform which enables users to earn cash while recommending (currently) ethical products to their friends. This in turn enables businesses to gain access to new customers at a set acquisition cost via non-customer referrals.<br /><br />The current focus on ethical products addresses the fact that many of us are aware of environmental social issues and would like to do more to change consumption for the better but lack enough incentive & information to do so currently.<br /><br />The vision for Nettle is to disrupt the traditional affiliate & influencer industries by taking referral commission away from 'the algorithm' and putting it back into the pocket of the individual.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />*Where We’re At?*<br /><br />We’ve been revenue generating since the first day our web-based MVP was soft launched a few months ago.<br /><br />We’re now preparing to raise seed capital to accelerate our growth, develop the product & grow the team. <br /><br />-------------<br /><br />*The Role*<br /><br />We are looking for someone to join as a Technical Co-founder & CTO to fundamentally shape & built our main product offerings while managing all aspects of the technology side of the business.<br /><br />As a cofounder you be key in decision making across the business, beyond just its technical development.<br /><br />While your responsibilities as a co-founder will be wide-reaching, the early priorities on the technology side will be in building on the web-based MVP and in building & launching a mobile application.<br /><br />You would join the current full-time founder Edley, a marketing focussed co-founder, a small advisory board & occasional part-time/freelancers working out of a co-working hub near Old Street tube station in London.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />_Applicants must:_ <br />* Have experience building & launching web & mobile applications<br />* Be driven, independent, and passionate about entrepreneurship & early-stage startups<br /><br />_We love applicants that:_<br />* Have startup experience (whether an ex-founder or having worked in an early-stage startup)<br />* Have worked in/around affiliate/influencer/referral marketing<br />* Already live in London or are willing to move to London (or close by) in the future<br /><br />_We are open to:_<br />* Full time (45+ hrs/week) or part-time commitment (we're open to your suggestions)<br />* You persuading us that you’re the right person, whatever your background & experience <br /><br />-------------<br /><br />*What We Offer*<br /><br />* The opportunity to become the cofounder of a fast growing _tech for good_ startup<br />* A generous equity package (experience based)<br />* Salary at the seed raise (experience based)<br />* Flexible working (you can work on a flexible schedule & you can work remotely and out of our coworking space in London)<br /><br />All applications/enquiries will be responded to in the strictest confidence.<br /><br />If you have any questions about Nettle or the role, just leave them in your application!",

As well as our existing programs and events, we are also piloting and planning to launch new ones too.</p><p>We will ask you to work hard, fast and to the best of your ability.

We are building a global personal-publishing business that brings millions of people into our products – as co-creators and audiences We are best known for our first title, Lost My Name, which is read by over 4 million children and their families globally. We are releasing a new title every few months and now have 18 books in our range.</p><p>Our focus in the near future is with the children’s book market – creating stunning, uncompromisingly high quality and technically ambitious personalised books for kids.</p><p>We’re in the business of sparking kids’ imaginations; inspiring them to read &amp; to learn as well as build confidence and self-belief. May 2019 sees a relaunch of our website and material to back up that positioning.</p><p><strong>About the role</strong></p><ul><li><strong>2-4 hours per week</strong></li><li><strong>Remote – good internet connection required</strong></li><li>Start ASAP</li><li>£25/€29 per hour</li></ul><p>Wonderbly is looking for wonderful Dutch-speaking editors/proof-readers, who can work closely with our copywriters to ensure the highest standard content for our international markets.</p><p>It’s our editor’s job to ensure that the copy we use across all our comms to customers is on brand, appropriately localised and free of errors.</p><p>It’s a chance to help to create humorous, lively and all-around-fun copy for a company that is dedicated to making children more clever, curious and kind (and making them laugh, too).</p><p><strong><u>What you will do</u></strong></p><p>The role is to edit/proof-read content written by our marketing copywriters. The proofing is to ensure there are no errors in the copy but also to feedback on the quality and content of what is written.</p><p>Whilst our copywriters generally retain the final call on what is written, our editors offer support in ideas on how to improve the copy and ensure that it is suitable for the audience in that particular market.</p><p>We expect our copywriters and editors to work in quite a collaborative way but are flexible in what this means for each language team.</p><p>All of the content is for marketing, brand and editorial purposes across our website and digital marketing channels. Therefore having an editor with experience working with e-commerce brands and with an understanding of paid marketing channels such as Facebook and PPC is a huge benefit.</p><p>In addition to this, our editors should, of course, know their market extremely well – preferably from the view point of digital marketing.<br>The three main kinds of content that you’ll be working on are…</p><ul><li><u><strong>Website</strong></u><ul><li>As an e-commerce company, our website is our shop and needs to communicate who we are and what we do. Our tone of voice is important to us, and should be consistently upheld across the website.</li><li>At the same time, each locale should have a tailor fit approach to give our customers the best possible experience, no matter where they live. In addition, the purchase journey should be as smooth as possible – enabling customers to make a pain free purchase and leave them wanting to come back again and again!</li></ul></li><li><strong><u>Paid marketing + Email</u></strong><ul><li>We tell our audiences about our books across performance marketing channels such as Facebook and PPC/Google Search. The ideal candidate would have experience editing for a similar brand across digital marketing platforms – and have knowledge of the markets in order to successfully cover relevant keywords and messaging, as well as bringing ideas for fresh content.

But teaching people how to get control of their money and changing lives one budget at a time is what gets us up in the morning. We want to grow our reach even further, and we’re looking for a versatile writer we can entrust with one of our most valuable assets: <strong>The YNAB Voice.</strong></p><p>You are a natural storyteller—funny and creative—but you understand the importance of the business objectives behind the message. We know this because you artfully tucked the CTA right behind the first joke. #nailedit! Cheesy doesn’t scare you, because you can dad joke #likeaboss.</p><p>Not only are you swift and mighty with your pen, you are always jotting down ideas and pitching new approaches. The marketing team will quickly consider you a huge creative asset and wonder how they ever got on without you. Which gives you an idea for a blog post…</p><p>Without ever sacrificing quality, you understand the role of SEO, optimization, and conversion copy approaches. You strike the balance (and sometimes a pose) with ease.</p><p>You can shift gears—blog posts, landing pages, email courses, ad campaigns, newsletters, video scripts, perhaps even a parody song or two—because regardless of the format, you can crack yourself up and nail the headline without breaking a sweat.</p><p><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</strong></p><ul><li>Prolific writer with a sense of humor and experience thriving under daily deadline pressure</li><li>Did we mention a sense of humor? (Because if you haven’t already thought to yourself how hilarious this job posting reads, well,…)</li><li>Unintimidated and energized at the prospect of writing 5-15 pieces of content per week (depending on variables like story type, length, complexity, weather, etc.)</li><li>Proven ability to produce high-quality content across genres (practical how-tos, researched deep dives, customer profiles, first-person narrative, pop psychology, etc.)</li><li>Idea generating machine who considers the implications of SEO, trends, multiple audiences/platforms, larger goals with every piece of content, as naturally as breathing (and, OK, fine, yes—probably has a little flair for the dramatic)</li><li>Excellent time management skills which make juggling—multiple projects, daily, weekly and monthly deadlines, and an always changing assortment of story types—look easy</li><li>Desire to help lead overall content strategy</li></ul><p>That gives you a pretty good idea of the job, but first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. (We think you will.)</p><p><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></p><p>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (Google us, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our Cultural Manifestohas to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</p><p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p><p><strong>Lindsey &amp; The Gang </strong>aka the Marketing Team aka just a rag-tag but lovable bunch of underdogs who defy the odds—making budgeting software hilarious, emotional, and accessible—day in and day out. (Disney, are you listening?)</p><p>We love musical theater, board games, stand-up comedy, the Enneagram, video games, and art, to varying degrees, depending on who you talk to first. Our internal Slack channel is so much fun, it has a growing fanbase.</p><p>Lindsey, our Chief Marketing Officer, will be the first to delete something very important, but also the first to celebrate your wins—big and small. Ryan, our Digital Marketing Director, will quickly become your lifeline in any type of bracketology-related emergency and even under website-launch-level-stress, he can sneak in the jokes that make you feel like, “if Dad’s OK, we’ll all be OK.”</p><p>And then there’s, Ben B. and Janelle, who lead out on Community Engagement and Social Media, respectively. They both have huge hearts, and a tangible passion for our customers, plus they are hilarious. Reema, our Marketing Manager, keeps all the balls in the air, while wearing many different hats, basically, if there is a need, yo, she’ll solve it (and yes, that was a seamless incorporation of Vanilla Ice lyrics).</p><p>Plus, our brilliant creatives, Lauren and Marian (designers), Tristan (animation), and Hannah (video), who bring everything to life. They are a veritable idea machine who serve to make us look good on a daily basis. What more could a writer ask for?</p><p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></p><p><strong>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. </strong>Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too. Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong>The YNAB Meetup</strong></p><p><strong>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and most recently, Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</strong></p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.</p><p><strong>International is Absolutely Okay</strong></p><p><strong>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor.</strong> Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</p><p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></p><p>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em> <em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.</p><p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not <em>think</em> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Marketing Content Writer…</strong></p><p>Before ‘content marketing’ and ‘social media’ were buzzwords, YNAB’s marketing efforts were anchored in content and community. And we’re doubling down.</p><p>Considering the size of our current team, we pump out a remarkable amount of content, but we are looking for a sharp, creative, curious storyteller to help us take it to the next level.</p><p>You are marketing-minded and love nothing more than nailing a message with the kind of laser focus that pierces the hearts of your target audience. Sure, you can (and do!) pull direction from the data, but you excel at all-the-feelings that make storytelling such a powerful tool.</p><p>You have a solid understanding of content marketing, social media marketing, and lead generation. Of course, you are an excellent writer and editor, but even more than that you understand that it is the <em>right </em>content, for the <em>right</em> audience, in the <em>right</em> context, that converts to sign-ups.</p><p><strong>You are our ideal candidate if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Have at least 3-5 years of professional writing experience with a portfolio that showcases hitting daily or near-daily publication deadlines.</li><li>Can nail the YNAB voice, but also have a distinct voice all your own.</li><li>Excel at juggling multiple projects and timelines at any given moment and switching gears, keeps you fresh and stimulated.</li><li>Write engaging blog content of all shapes and sizes (first person narrative, educational, inspirational, practical/how-to).</li><li>Write emails that get opened, ads that are clicked on, and landing pages that convert.</li><li>Write snappy ad copy, educational scripts, and who knows, maybe even an e-book or a 6-week course for a niche audience. We’re full of surprises—can you write them?</li><li>Establish strategies and processes for optimizing and repurposing/republishing content to improve SEO and increase sign-ups</li><li>The possibilities are endless, but we want someone who is pumped to help craft the strategy and then write the thing. (All the things!)</li><li>Make us laugh.</li><li>Manage your time exceptionally well and comfortable working remotely.</li><li>Incredibly organized, flexible, and collaborative.</li><li>Never met a deadline you didn’t love.</li><li>Self-motivated and driven by nature, maybe even a little competitive.</li><li>Stay laser-focused on the big picture, without losing sight of every. last. detail.</li><li>Wildly productive and independent, but a team-player at heart.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></p><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li><li>You live on or around the West Coast. We’ll double down for California or Washington. (Not a requirement, just bonus points!)</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0jelh' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too. Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h4></div><div></div><div>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h4></div><div></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></h4></div><div></div><div>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and most recently, Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><h4><span>Up Your Game</span></h4></div><div></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><h4><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></h4></div><div></div><div>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><h4><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h4></div><div></div><div>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.</div><div><br></div><div><h3><b><span>Other Tidbits</span></b></h3></div><div></div><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) <span></span></li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. <br></li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.<br></li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.<br></li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.<br></li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not think that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!<span></span></li></ul><div><br></div><div></div><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</div><div><br></div><div><h3><b><span>Now, back to you, our new Marketing Content Writer...</span></b></h3></div><div></div><div>Before ‘content marketing’ and ‘social media’ were buzzwords, YNAB’s marketing efforts were anchored in content and community. And we’re doubling down. </div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Considering the size of our current team, we pump out a remarkable amount of content, but we are looking for a sharp, creative, curious storyteller to help us take it to the next level. </div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>You are marketing-minded and love nothing more than nailing a message with the kind of laser focus that pierces the hearts of your target audience. Sure, you can (and do!) pull direction from the data, but you excel at all-the-feelings that make storytelling such a powerful tool. </div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>You have a solid understanding of content marketing, social media marketing, and lead generation. Of course, you are an excellent writer and editor, but even more than that you understand that it is the right content, for the right audience, in the right context, that converts to sign-ups. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>You are our ideal candidate if you:</div><div></div><ul><li>Have at least 3-5 years of professional writing experience with a portfolio that showcases hitting daily or near-daily publication deadlines. <span></span></li><li>Can nail the YNAB voice, but also have a distinct voice all your own. <br></li><li>Excel at juggling multiple projects and timelines at any given moment and switching gears, keeps you fresh and stimulated. <br></li><li>Write engaging blog content of all shapes and sizes (first person narrative, educational, inspirational, practical/how-to). <br></li><li>Write emails that get opened, ads that are clicked on, and landing pages that convert. <br></li><li>Write snappy ad copy, educational scripts, and who knows, maybe even an e-book or a 6-week course for a niche audience. We’re full of surprises—can you write them? <br></li><li>Establish strategies and processes for optimizing and repurposing/republishing content to improve SEO and increase sign-ups <br></li><li>The possibilities are endless, but we want someone who is pumped to help craft the strategy and then write the thing. (All the things!) <br></li><li>Make us laugh. <br></li><li>Manage your time exceptionally well and comfortable working remotely. <br></li><li>Incredibly organized, flexible, and collaborative. <br></li><li>Never met a deadline you didn’t love. <br></li><li>Self-motivated and driven by nature, maybe even a little competitive. <br></li><li>Stay laser-focused on the big picture, without losing sight of every. last. detail. <br></li><li>Wildly productive and independent, but a team-player at heart. </li></ul><div><br></div><div><h3><b><span>Bonus Points:</span></b></h3></div><div></div><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB. <span></span></li><li>You live on or around the West Coast. We’ll double down for California or Washington. (Not a requirement, just bonus points!) </li></ul><div><h3><b><span>How to Apply</span></b></h3></div><div></div><ul><li>Apply here (<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0jelh' rel='nofollow'>https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0jelh</a>) by June 4, 2019.

Through expert human curation and innovative tech, we’re taking a scientific and systematic approach to vetting every home in every city launched, and accepting only the top 1%. Like a modern Michelin Guide - but for homes.<br /><br />We launched 3 years ago in London. Since then, we have grown 15-20% month on month; expanded to 6 cities; tested over 100,000 homes; developed a customer experience that’s returning the highest NPS scores in the hospitality sector; and are on track to reach over £25M in annualised sales.<br /><br />We are backed by some the top VCs and angel investors who have built many of the most exciting companies of today. These include TransferWise, Citymapper, Appear Here, Graze, Depop, GymBox, Secret Escapes and many more.<br /><br />We’ve just closed a £14m Series B round of funding. Our focus for the next 12 months is on building a unique and exceptional brand & customer experience; and maintaining hyper growth through an accelerated global rollout. This is where you come in.<br /><br /><br />*The Role*<br /><br />This role involves working as part of a London-based team who will be testing the best hosts and homes in Plum’s US markets. We are currently open in New York and Los Angeles and will be expanding to other US cities within the next year. <br /><br />Once a home has passed the Plum test, you will be responsible for gathering and quality checking the output of our freelancers (including Home Critics and Photographers who test and shoot the homes) in each city. You will then transform their work into listings that are truly inspiring. And 100% accurate.<br /><br />There’s a light & a dark side to this role.<br /><br />On one hand, it’s an unparalleled opportunity to become a start-up expert. You will learn how a startup opens a city, executes, and builds digital products. You’ll learn aesthetic judgement skills that will serve you for life, and how to get the best work out of creatives.<br /><br />On the other hand, we have ridiculously high standards and you’ll be required to meet these under unrealistically short timelines, whilst being part of a team who have only been on the job for a matter of months, or weeks for some. You’ll need to be driven, proactive and motivated by a challenge to enjoy this ride.<br /><br />*About you*<br /><br />1. You are ridiculously well organised and know (and are motivated by) working to a tight deadline through time management<br /><br />2. You have excellent spoken & written English<br /><br />3. A sharp eye for detail: you notice the small things. A sub-standard photo or badly written copy, would never get past your inspection<br /><br />4. A taste-maker: Obsessive about design, style, photography and copy. You have a great eye and plenty of confidence in your creative vision<br /><br />5. A confident self-learner: confident at teaching yourself to do things you have never done before on a daily basis  <br /><br />6. You have unreasonably high standards for what is good enough<br /><br />7. Super entrepreneurial: You care about getting shit done. And when obstacles inevitably get in the way, you know how to hustle  <br /><br />8. A problem solver: no problem is unmanageable for you<br /><br />9. You fit the Plum brand values and culture, and will leave a great impression on hosts<br /><br />10. And if you want to make us feel like we’ve won the lottery, you will have lived in the US and are especially familiar with NYC and LA.<br /><br /><br />*Benefits*<br /><br />1. Learn to hustle and become a startup expert  <br /><br />2. Make your mark by building something tangible in a matter of months<br /><br />3. Learn skills that will serve you for life<br /><br />4. Be a member of what we believe will be one of the most famous startups of the next 10 years<br /><br />5. Work from a buzzing office in Shoreditch<br /><br /><br />We are open to a range of professional backgrounds, so if in doubt please apply.<br /><br />The start date for this role will be mid-June 2019.",
