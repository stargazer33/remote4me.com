And now, because we’re growing so much, we need the help of a great writer.</span></p><p><span>That’s where you come in.</span></p><p><span>We’re looking for someone who is passionate about our mission of helping 1,000,000 women find true love. If you’re right for this position, this mission is something you can TRULY get behind and take to heart.</span></p><p><span>You’ll be searching for the best new dating advice. You’ll be doing some research on scientific studies/data surrounding online and offline dating. And you’ll become an expert yourself (even more than you are now) at attraction, influence, and human psychology.</span><span>We create two types of videos:&nbsp;</span></p><ol><li><span>YouTube Videos which inspire and entertain our audience. (Think: Emotional, relatable stories, lessons, advice videos.)</span></li><li><span>Paid educational video programs that teach social psychology related to dating and attraction. (Think: “A step-by-step 4 hour program on how to create the most attractive, irresistible online dating profile possible.”)</span></li></ol><p><span>With that said, this will not be an “easy” position. On one hand, you will have to work hard, move fast, and get content out on time (as we have a fast-paced startup culture).</span></p><p><span>But on the other hand, you will grow personally and professionally faster than you ever have before. Because our culture is centered around growth.</span></p><p><span>A couple things to keep in mind:</span></p><ul><li><span>You should be an avid YouTube viewer who realizes the power of social media and how it's changing the business world and culture at large.</span></li><li><span>You should treat your work as art. Meaning you only put out THE BEST 100% of the time, and you strive to create content that’s premium.</span></li><li><span>You should enjoy the fact that we have high standards for our work and set aggressive deadlines. (While the hours for this position are flexible, we’re looking for someone who is excited about what we do. And who loves to do meaningful work.)</span></li></ul><p><span>Also, you must feel comfortable asking for forgiveness rather than permission. We want you to take initiative, and we do not want to micromanage you. I’m NOT looking for someone who is polite (at the cost of results), tells me what I want to hear, or takes things personally.</span></p><p><span>One last thing - the topic of our videos deals with evolutionary psychology and explores the messy reality of dating and attraction.</span></p><p><span>Some would call our advice “controversial.” (We don’t agree with that assessment, though.) And so, you must be okay with taking a counter-intuitive stance on generally accepted ideas...if they happen to be the most accurate (based on science).</span></p><p><span>We view attraction as a primal instinct which is amoral and if you have strong moral opinions on how women should date or interact with men, and are not willing to hear/discuss alternative viewpoints, then this job is not for you.</span></p><p><b>Summary:</b></p><ul><li><span>This is not a beginner’s position.&nbsp; You must have at least 1 year of experience writing YouTube content, online courses, or something similar.</span></li><li><span>This is a part-time role, starting between 40-80 hours per month. If we work well together, this will lead to a full-time paid position.</span></li><li><span>This role is remote, so you can work anywhere in the United States as long as you can communicate via email, chat, and phone.</span></li></ul><p><b>Examples of Possible Tasks and Responsibilities</b></p><ul><li><span>Writing viral YouTube video scripts on dating, attraction, and relationships</span></li><li><span>Writing descriptions for old YouTube videos</span></li><li><span>Writing content emails that give advice and inspire our subscribers</span></li><li><span>Brainstorming new video ideas</span></li><li><span>Researching topics for content</span></li></ul><p><span>If you are excited about hard work and creating cool things together, here’s just a few benefits you’ll receive by working with us:</span></p><ul><li><span>Make a real difference in thousands (even millions) of women’s lives</span></li><li><span>Access to unique experiences (Special YouTuber events, traveling with the team)</span></li><li><span>Work with a FUN team that is passionate about being the BEST at what we do</span></li><li><span>Work directly with top online marketer with proven success growing businesses</span></li><li><span>Work directly with top dating coach and love industry expert</span></li><li><span>Work with other A-Players (we only hire the best and currently have a best selling author and ivy league psychologist on our Slack)</span></li></ul><p><span>If I haven’t scared you away yet, please email your resume, a cover letter on why you’d be a good fit and a few examples of your work to </span><a rel='nofollow'><span><span data-cfemail=&quot;305a51435f5e70514444425153445742555144574549431e535f5d&quot;>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></span></a></p>          </div>          </div>",

No one else. I'm a soloist who a grand idea. I'm not a fiction/publishing company looking to churn out hundreds of ghost written novels every year nor am I going to woo you with reverse psychology rhetoric questions i.e. Are you looking (fill in the blank) and earn (fill in the blank) writing... you get the idea.</p>\n  <p>I'm simply a dude with a small budget and a grand action adventure fantasy idea I like to bring to life.</p>\n  <p>I've only posted this job here at problogger and no where else (i.e. not reddit/freelancer/upwork etc). I trust the quality of applicants here and I utmost respect your time.</p>\n  <p><strong>My agenda for this novel:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Recreation! For Fun!</li>\n   <li>Commercial but I understand 98% of such fiction don't make it (But I'm hopeful :))</li>\n   <li>I have an ultimate moral/life lesson to share (Yes. I've watched Simon Sinek's Ted Talk - Power of Why almost a million times! My Why is ON FIRE HERE)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>What I need:</strong></p>\n  <p>I've tried my hands at writing out this fiction fantasy myself but due to work constraints, family and a day limited to 24 hours - I wish a 'day' could have more hours!! - I'm extremely time poor.</p>\n  <p><em>I need a reliable and experienced ghost with:</em></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Urban fantasy experience</li>\n   <li>Has written to young adult audience (think of Harry Potter to Twilight)</li>\n   <li>Writes third person POV well</li>\n   <li>Can write that SHOWS rather than TELL</li>\n   <li>Can write that stirs EMOTIONS</li>\n   <li>Knowledgeable in Buddhism/Eastern esoteric knowledge/High concept of Meditation/Reincarnation/Karma</li>\n   <li>Outrageously creative and thinks outside the box and further into the 4th dimension of creative hyperbole</li>\n   <li>Sign exclusive NDA (in case this novel might 'pop' but I know 98% don't - but I'm an optimist but I'm also a realist)</li>\n   <li>Can bounce ideas off me and suggest scenes</li>\n   <li>Must be able to Skype or whatever online talk</li>\n   <li>Able to do research/brainstorm character arcs/brainstorm act structures/story beats (You must know your shit about story arcs - I've read almost everything under the sun about fiction writing/screen writing/structure)</li>\n   <li>Simply be patient and flexible with me BUT I'm not a 'scope creep' - once the story beats are mapped out - it will stay that way UNLESS we both mutually agree a change of direction is required to revive the story</li>\n   <li>You've watched Avatar - The Last Airbender and you love it to bits (the cartoon not M. Night Shyamalan's rubbish and failed adaptation)</li>\n   <li>You are keen to explore fiction/adventure involving karma/reincarnation/eastern meditation powers + lessons of redemption/theme of love/friendship (I'll tell you more after I've short listed you) ;)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Lastly you must like:</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>The Kite runner</li>\n   <li>Life of Pi</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>I like detail but obviously not to that level as I'm on a small budget (But I don't want any writing like Jodi Picoult! Don't mean to offend any Picoult fans out there - but no)</p>\n  <p><strong>My requirements:</strong></p>\n  <p>Just common sense stuff:</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>You got past work (I know you're got NDAs but show me some samples of work you can release and show me)</li>\n   <li>Not looking for ghost writing agencies or groups. I'm looking for indie writers. Or someone who does it for a living or breaking out.</li>\n   <li>Someone who has TIME vs my lack of time. Don't want to work with someone who lacks time. Too much friction. I won't yield to your time limitation.</li>\n   <li>Experience wise - Don't BS me. I don't expect you to be perfect. I just need someone who can help me write a first draft FOLLOWING my guidelines and directions but knowledgeable about story beats/character arcs/POV (I'll know very quickly if you write 3rd POV of the protagonist and then the POV changes suddenly - these type of NOOB error will end our arrangement) - if you're a noob, be honest about it and I'll work with you</li>\n   <li>You write excellent English. Great command of words. (Anything but this is a NO NO. It's like the blind leading the blind here and I've definitely someone who speaks English as a second language so NO please if you are like this unless you can really wow me with your material.)</li>\n   <li>Looking for someone with a easy going personality</li>\n   <li>Don't take this project if you feel flaky about it. I need 3 to 6 months commitment or even more.</li>\n   <li>I'm very demanding if your work is subpar especially if I've set out objectives in the scene or certain beats to achieve in story and it sounds wish washy or un-researched.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>Remuneration:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>I got a small budget but I'm thinking of writing a series. Will pay you accordingly and definitely keep using you if the first draft is LIT.</li>\n   <li>If I get published. I'll further remunerate you with a bonus. But sorry, no royalties or credits so you hopefully you can let this baby go if you're getting too involved with it. NDA will cover this off.</li>\n   <li>Open to retainer but you must offer me an overview or milestone of what to expect.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>When would I like to start:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>To be honest ASAP. But story arc and characters still need to be fleshed out. Will pay for your time with these type of consultations and then further pay for your words.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>Resources/help:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>I've got all the researched material I can scan you.</li>\n   <li>I got a few scenes I've written so you can see my voice.</li>\n   <li>Will only give this all out if I've short listed you.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><strong>For those who've read thus far and reached this final blurb:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Please email me at <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span> - John</li>\n   <li>I won't read generic CVs. So write a cover letter. It shows you're keen.</li>\n   <li>I'm expecting many inquiries - If I don't respond - sorry it's either you didn't write me a personal email and copy and pasted a generic response or I've found someone (I'm only looking for ONE - sorry!)</li>\n   <li>I don't care if you have a website or linkedin or whatever. Just send me your work. It needs to resonate with me.</li>\n   <li>At the end, this is me. I'm long winded and I will be like this when you work with me. I can be dry and blunt/pushy and creatively whacky. (But if this turns you off - GOOD - we won't work well together any ways)</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Thank you!</p>\n  <p>P.s. Seriously thank you for reading thus far!</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

So from content ideas (which I can help with), to assigning content to a writer in our team, to commissioning featured images from our designer to hitting publish.</p>\n  <p>You will not have to do any writing yourself.</p>\n  <p>You will also be responsible for editing everyone's work and signing it off before publication. The writers we work with are all very good at what they do so not much in the way of editing is usually required. It's more things like spelling mistakes, being aware of potential SEO issues (like unnatural looking keyword usage from an SEO perspective), picking up on any points you feel the writer needs to clarify etc. So what I would call pretty light editing.</p>\n  <p>You should be at the very least familiar with WordPress and hopefully you will have experience writing/editing about WordPress yourself.</p>\n  <p>A role like this requires someone with good organisation skills who can populate a content calendar weeks and even months in advance.</p>\n  <p>You will work closely with me as the blog is something I like working on and I still want to be involved.</p>\n  <p>We publish around 2-3 posts a week on average. I estimate this role to take a few hours per week. Let's call it five. But I won't know for sure until we actually try it out. Over time there is the potential for more work if you also take over content updating responsibilities too (a lot of our posts need regular updating).</p> \n </div> \n <h5>Application Instructions</h5> \n <div>\n   Send an email with a short covering letter to jobs[at]athemes.com.

For more than 70 years, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has bridged the divide between scientific research, global security, and public engagement.</p>\n <p><strong>Position Description</strong></p>\n <p>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is searching for an organized, creative, and committed assistant editor to help shape our coverage of nuclear weapons and other nuclear risk.</p>\n <p>The successful candidate will be an efficient, organized, and talented editor of both long- and short-form magazine articles, able to focus on the big picture and get all the details right. The Bulletin is an all-digital publication, and successful candidates will have experience with Web and mobile content management systems, a knack for social networking, and familiarity with multimedia software, including audio and video editing programs.</p>\n <p>The Bulletin’s authors are leading scientists and experts in their fields, which include nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, the fossil fuel use that drives climate change, and an array of other technologies that could, if misused, threaten humanity on a global scale. The assistant editor will work closely and collaboratively with the editor in chief and these experts to create compelling articles that are accessible to policy makers and lay audiences. All candidates must have an interest in the issues that we cover and national and international affairs generally. Experience editing in these fields is a definite advantage, but not required. All candidates must have excellent editing skills and the ability to work with high-profile writers and top experts. All of our editors are also expected to write for the Bulletin.</p>\n <p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Candidates must be based in the United States.</strong></li>\n  <li><strong>Bachelor’s degree required.&nbsp;</strong>Candidates must hold a degree in journalism or other relevant discipline or profession; study in international affairs, public policy, or related discipline a plus.</li>\n  <li>Minimum of three solid years of journalism experience.</li>\n  <li>An understanding of WordPress or a similar content management system.</li>\n  <li>Experience with Final Cut Pro, the Adobe Creative Suite, and other multimedia software is a plus, as is a solid presence in social media.</li>\n  <li>Proficiency with common office productivity software (e.g., Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Adobe Acrobat, Office 365) required.</li>\n  <li>We are looking for a team player who is flexible and comfortable with multi-tasking.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>The Bulletin has a relatively small staff of brilliant, highly educated over-achievers; the assistant editor we hire will also have these qualities. Salary is commensurate with experience.&nbsp;<strong>This is a telecommuting position that can be performed anywhere in the United States, given that there is a strong internet connection. Preference will be given to candidates who live in Washington, DC. Overwhelmingly brilliant candidates from Europe and Asia will be considered.</strong></p>\n <p>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, ancestry, color, religion, gender, age, marital status, sexual orientation, national origin, medical condition, disability, veteran status, union membership or activity or any other basis protected by law.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://thebulletin.org/2019/07/were-hiring-assistant-editor/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

    "content": "<h3>Case study content writer for IMAGINEER creative marketing company</h3>\n<div>\n Company: Berkshire Premiums\n</div>Location: Anywhere\n<br>Job Type: Contract\n<div> \n <h5>Description</h5> \n <div> \n  <p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong></p>\n  <p>Looking for a gun writer to create high quality and well researched content for our portfolio website (www.berkshirepremiums.com.au) and linked in profile ghosting under our director’s name.</p>\n  <p>You need to be able to do in-depth research and write content for our particular niche of business.</p>\n  <p><strong>What do we do:</strong> We are high ticket item marketing company specialising in brokering digital copy right content (i.e think of any new Disney movie i..e Toy story 4) to listed or large local corporations to help design from scratch high concept marketing campaigns in the form of creating customise merchandises and tailor packaging designs to help turn their regular run of the mill products to HOT IN DEMAND items i..e Think of a popular Juice company that slaps Toy Story 4 on their disposal juice cups and gives a free toy of a Toy story 4 character holding on a juice cup.</p>\n  <p>(If I lost you there... Let me digress) ...</p>\n  <p>A lot of people don’t get what we do so I’ll give an example below:</p>\n  <p>Think of Quaker Oats in America. When the final Avenger’s movie was released - i..e Endgame/Thanos. We brokered the campaign between Marvel and Quacker Oates which allowed Quacker Oates to use Marvel’s character’s on their packaging. As the digital broker and also Marketing design company, we designed the entire packaging from start (i.e. Characters interacting with the brand/logo), we created free collectable trading cards and free Avenger toys along with every Quacker Oates box (I.e Kids will line up to buy the oates in hope of collecting a power stone etc). Quacker Oates doesn’t charge their end consumers more for the normal oates that they usually sell but they pay us a fee to help run this campaign and design from scratch. A successful campaign requires a minimum of 2million units to justify our mass production of these customised merchandises at minimal cost for Quaker oates PLUS our fulfillment team's cost. And why would Quacker Oates appeal to our proposed pitch and pay us to do this for them? Well… it sells their Oates LIKE CRAZY as it rides along with the Avenger’s craze - End consumers, most likely kids, ain't buying the damn oates, they just wanted to collect those rare collectible cards!</p>\n  <p>So that’s what we do… We help (fill in the blank big company) to utilise (any hot movie or digitally copy right product that is trending) and help them produce/design Packaging, collectables, toys – anything imaginable that is given away for free or a discounted price to attract end consumers to buy their stuff.</p>\n  <p>And our target market is BIG businesses with BIG marketing budgets that can give away free stuff to attract more customers. (A small company can't justify giving free stuff and still make a profit)</p>\n  <p>Sadly, the above success with Quaker and those big companies are part of a bigger parent company and they are based in Indonesia and killing the Indonesian marketing scene. However their content is in Indonesian and they’re trying to break into the Australian market.</p>\n  <p><strong><em>This is where we come in.</em></strong> We are a small sister company newly opened in Australia. We can reference to the past success our sister company had in Indonesia but to this date we are still brand spanking new to the scene and looking for new clients (i.e big Businesses in Australia to use our service here – leveraging the resources in Indonesia – i.e. the fulfillment team and we just do the selling here – i.e. land the contract, then our sister company delivers and we have exclusive use of their design team)</p>\n  <p>So to help our sales team here in Australia we need a writer to help create compelling content, to attract awareness, creating a following, get awareness from the big marketing guns on linked in, create case studies of projected and potential sales if they were to use us (doing all that while we don’t really have our first customer here).</p>\n  <p><strong>Example of topics could be:</strong></p>\n  <p>&quot;How running a #nostraw campaign for KFC in Indonesia generated more sales?&quot; [i.e. Indonesia KFC ran this campaign with our sister company and killed it in sales. But sadly Australia is a very conservative and mind you monopolistic country, there’s barely any lack of competition, KFC Australia can’t be bothered to even try even if there’s potential more sales and plus METAL straws are great for the environment!]</p>\n  <p>&quot;Department stores that give away XYZ toys for over $60 purchase can generate XYZ&quot; [Trying to appeal to the big department stores to think of what tailor merchandising and creating collectable cards trending with the latest upcoming movie block buster will generate them in income]</p>\n  <p>&quot;Free collectable star wars coins in XYZ Supermarket has quadrupled their sales&quot; [Appealing to big chian super markets]</p>\n  <p>We need big marketing companies who read these blogs going ‘hmmm… maybe we should do this stuff… and try these guys out and see if they can do a mock up design for us….’</p>\n  <p><strong>About the work</strong></p>\n  <p>You get the gist, we’re a small company and we need someone who understands this field of marketing and simply generate content with imagination and somewhat vision of the future if (XYZ) was to use our tailored packaging and merchandising ideas and how will their profit look like, how will their brand awareness boost, how they can be like (ABC) company who is doing this in (EFD) country.</p>\n  <p>Our sister company is happy to give away their previous stats and successes and we need to write content that says what we need and what we could do for so and so. (NDA must be signed)</p>\n  <p>We then need a writer to write case studies that educate future marketing managers to think of us when they map out their next marketing budget. We need to entice them to invest, to try new things, be bold and try this new niche of marketing. (Or even just to accept our invitation to go and meet with them and show them our past campaigns and already made products.)</p>\n  <p>Researched case studies are used to nurture and educate potential clients on how customised merchandised marketing is killing in sales for other companies overseas (not just Indonesia) and Australian big companies are definitely falling behind if they don’t do it!</p>\n  <p>The articles, depending on the topic, will be around 1000 – 1200 word/enough for a good linked in or blog post for SEO optimisation. We are looking to have 1-2 pieces done every month. Depending on our budget. Although we can use resources from our Indonesian sister company. We are using our own budget to start this here so are very mindful of cost. Obviously if we land a big one. That’s a totally different story. We may be hiring more writers and get them on a full time thing.</p>\n  <p>So we need someone who can grow with us and also LEARN this business with us!</p>\n  <p>As for now, we will pay after every content piece, preferably through PayPal. Other payment methods and timing can be discussed.</p>\n  <p><strong>Job Requirements</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Native English speaker with strong writing skills and ability to write in a way that shows an expertise in the field of what we do.</li>\n   <li>Exceptional online research skills (don’t just use data from our sister company. Please source info from all around the world. There’s similar companies who are doing this elsewhere.)</li>\n   <li>Well-organized and reliable</li>\n   <li>It’s a major plus if you understand our business niche i.e. merchandising, premiums, packaging, digital brokering copy rights to other companies to sell their products – as we need to sound like the expert here in the industry</li>\n   <li>Prefer if you know: Topics that can include retail business stats with before and after profits from using such services like ours, how customised marketing can increase retail business profitability, promotional items or campaigns to boost sales, how companies use Disney/Fox/Whatever big cinematic company (the latest movies/events) to boost sales.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>New writers are welcome to apply with samples,&nbsp; but we will prioritise experienced writers (especially those who can provide links to published articles)</li>\n   <li>Completely unique content. Spun or plagiarised content will not be accepted.</li>\n   <li>Be familiar with what constitutes an authority source to back up claims</li>\n   <li>A basic understanding of SEO and keywords</li>\n   <li>Ability to accept PayPal</li>\n   <li>You may be asked to sign a NDA.</li>\n   <li>Valuable content only. Repetitive, fluff or filler content will not be accepted.</li>\n   <li>Include photos and/or videos when appropriate.</li>\n   <li>Include references and in-text links when appropriate.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p><strong>How to apply?</strong></p>\n  <p>Please send an email to&nbsp;<span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span>:</p>\n  <ul>\n   <li>A couple of sentences introduction you, where you are located, what you do for a living in case you are not a full-time writer and explaining why you think you would be a good fit.</li>\n   <li>2-3 URLs showcasing your work related to a business topic preferably showcasing a lighter more conversational style or scripts for videos or podcasts.</li>\n   <li>Your rates, preferably per word in USD</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p>\n  <p>&nbsp;</p> \n </div> \n</div>",
