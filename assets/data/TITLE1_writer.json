We maintain hundreds of open source modules, among those the npm CLI, one of the most active projects on Github. In order to ensure that the millions of users of our software can find the support they need to be successful we are cultivating a community of javascript developers.</p><p>Our challenges extend beyond simply writing code or engineering software. We need you to help us grow our software, grow our users as engineers and help turn our users into contributors.</p><p></p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong><ul></ul><li>Your job will be to grow the community by making it easier to join and faster to get productive.</li><li>You’ll also get feedback from users and synthesize it into bug reports, feature requests, and strategic direction to make our software and services better.</li><li>Your responsibilities will be varied and may include writing documentation, giving talks, building prototypes, or leading user discussions both online and in person.</li><p>To achieve all this,</p><ul></ul><li>you’ll be collaborating with teammates who are focused on software engineering as well as marketing, product management, and sales.</li><li>You will need to communicate clearly, write authoritatively, and speak publicly about your and your team’s work.</li><li>You should enjoy learning and explaining technical matters as well as writing clear examples and demo code. npm is primarily a JavaScript community, so experience with JavaScript is essential.</li><p></p><strong>What We Value</strong><p>Our team values stability, communication, action, sustainability, empathy, and reflection. We work collaboratively to find the best solutions to problems. We write and speak constantly about our work, both to improve our own thinking about it and to communicate with one another and our users. Because the team is small, we also value creativity, and continual process improvements. Your work at npm will make every JavaScript developer in the world faster and happier.</p><p></p><strong>Our Code of Conduct</strong><p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct&nbsp;.</p><a href='https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct' rel='nofollow'>here</a><p></p><strong>Why You Should Join</strong><p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p><p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p><p></p><strong>Where We Can Hire</strong><p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We are hiring humans from around the globe. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. If you have experience working remotely, so do we. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p><div> <div><div><p> <br><br> <b>To apply for this job please visit the URL below.</b> <br><br> Please reference <b>Jobspresso</b> in your job application, so that remote companies know where their best candidates are coming from  <br><br> <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npmjs/11bc7130-89fa-4999-a030-892012cdcff3' rel='nofollow'>https://jobs.lever.co/npmjs/11bc7130-89fa-4999-a030-892012cdcff3 →</a></p></div></div></div>",

We help smart, talented, creative professionals make a meaningful impact in media, technology and the world around them. The Vox Media house of network includes industry-leading media forces like SB Nation, Eater, The Verge, Vox, Curbed, Recode, and Polygon, and reaches an audience of hundreds of millions, generating over a billion content views each month.</p><p></p><strong>Come internet with us!</strong><p>SB Nation’s NBA team site covering the New York Knicks is looking for more talent to add to their tremendous staff. We value writers that help enrich discussion on our sites, promote our material on social media and cover everything entailed with basketball. Bring your strong voice and opinions and share your thoughts with the world. Your chance for greatness is at hand.</p><h4></h4><strong>The Skinny</strong><p>Joining the exclusive staff of one of our team sites gives you one of the more prominent voices in the basketball community. Team fan bases are always ravenously consuming our material, and you’ll have a chance to speak to the masses through our wide-reaching SB Nation platform.</p><p>Some of our staff have used their time with us as a springboard into other professional writing gigs with us and other media companies. While that’s definitely not the goal of everyone here, it’s a beautiful and very real perk for your efforts on the site. Write. Read. Grow.</p><h5></h5><strong>-The Staff We Need-</strong><p></p><strong>Contributor: Game Day Coverage</strong><p>The staple of SB Nation — one of the reasons people come to us and trust our coverage. There’s, at minimum, 90 games to cover every season (don’t forget those 8 preseason games!) and maybe even a postseason swath that’s even more intensely covered. For every game we have a preview, a live GameThread and post-game coverage that includes a quick recap (posted within a half hour of game’s end) and a full recap (in-depth analysis to be posted the next morning).</p><p>Someone interested in this type of writing could be involved in all of those aspects or be solely committed to helping with one of them.The people we need helping with this endeavor should be able to write concisely and would operate effectively on a schedule. Creative individuals who enjoy including videos and creating GIFs to enhance their analysis are especially encouraged to apply. Much like the News Reporting, Game Day Coverage usually provides the jumpstart for conversations and sets the tone after a win or loss.</p><p>Game Day coverage is generally shared among the site staff and involves both preview and recap duties.</p><p></p><strong>Contributor: Features and Analysis</strong><p>There’s obviously a ton of material that can be self generated on each team and isn’t reliant on news or game play for inspiration. We have all types of content flavors on our sites: film breakdowns, trade speculation, reaction to pop culture, silly lists, game diaries, and statistical analysis.</p><p>Perhaps your forte isn’t NBA X’s &amp; O’s, we still have a bevy of outlets into which you can pour your writer’s soul. Or maybe you’ve got a brand new idea for the site that you want to develop — we’re always on the lookout for passion and opinions. Ideally, people who are interested in this role would have some prior writing/blogging experience and be able to write lengthier pieces. These types of articles aren’t as time-sensitive as the news and game coverage.</p><p></p><strong>What you’ll bring:</strong><p></p><strong>Minimum qualifications</strong><ol></ol><li>You are a huge fan of basketball and passionate follower of your team and have experience writing about these topics.

We’re growing quickly and hiring to support our growth. Over 1,000 innovative companies – including tech giants like Spotify, Pinterest, Vistaprint, and Adobe – rely on the User Interviews platform to support their UX, design, and product development process. Join us today to help us influence the next several generations of products.</p><p><strong>Job Description</strong></p><p>User Interviews is looking for a junior level content crafter to join the marketing team (of 2!). The ideal candidate has a strong interest in UX and product design in general, and UX research in particular. Perhaps you have even worked as a designer, or do a little on the side. Your command of the English language is strong, and you geek out on Oxford comma usage. You know more words than you choose to use, because you’re trying to communicate with people, not show off.</p><ul><li>Your primary role will be writing and producing content including written (blog, newsletter, Field Guide, and social) and soon-to-come formats (podcast, video). You’ll also work with contributors to help source, edit, and publish their content. You’ll pitch new ideas, topics, and formats, and help get the word out there among our growing community of UX researchers. You’ll help build that community too. A huge bonus is if you can bring some basic (or not so basic) design skills to the role too.</li><li>You should have a fundamental curiosity about people, their behavior and interests. Our entire company is largely built around user interviews, that is talking to users, and we try to bring this interview format to our content heavily. You need to want to talk to people, and be willing to learn something from them. You also need to understand, instinctively and through data, what makes content good: honest, compelling, and useful to our audience.</li><li>You should want to understand complex topics deeply, and push yourself to explain them in novel yet really approachable and unpretentious ways.</li></ul><p>We’re a 16-person distributed team. That means you over-communicate, have a strong mastery of your own time and priorities, and are excited by the idea of joining an early-stage and lean startup.</p><p>Contact&nbsp;<a href='mailto:erin@userinterviews.com' rel='nofollow'>erin@userinterviews.com</a>&nbsp;if this sounds like a role you’d be really excited about and send a link to your LinkedIn profile + any relevant writing samples and/or design portfolios. Note: this is a junior level role, with a target salary of $45-$60k.</p><p><strong>What We’re Building</strong></p><p>User Interviews is a seed-funded startup on a mission to help companies build amazing products.

You’ve spent at least a few years building websites or apps, and you’ve got a foundational knowledge of software development because of it.</p><p>But somewhere along the way you realized that communication is the key to any software project — specifically, written communication. You understand the power of well-written technical content, but you also know the devil is in the details: you are no stranger to the challenges of accuracy, conciseness and relevance.</p><p>Alongside your development skills. you’ve probably honed your craft as a technical writer and editor through blog posts, documentation or something similar. Along the way you developed strong relationships with the people who inform your writing, because you know effective communication with them is key to your success.</p><p></p><strong>What</strong><p>As Editor-in-Chief for Twilio’s technical content, you will own the strategy for Twilio’s developer content across twilio.com and our other properties.</p><p>You’ll spend a good portion of your time writing for Twilio’s developer audience yourself, but you’ll more often find yourself collaborating with other teams across Twilio as they prepare content for our developer audience.</p><p>That content could be a refreshed landing page on twilio.com, a launch package of content for a new product, or a steady stream of blog posts and documentation to help us serve a community of developers we may have overlooked.</p><p>You’ll learn about the worlds of Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and web analytics if you haven’t already. You’ll likely dive even deeper in your data analysis to help us spot opportunities to reach new developers or better serve those already in our audience.</p><p>On rare occasions, you’ll crack open your text editor and build a new feature for twilio.com when it’s necessary to support your content strategy.</p><p>Above all else, however, you’ll set the strategy for all of Twilio’s technical content and support every contributor at Twilio to be a part of it.</p><p></p><strong>Why</strong><p>Twilio’s mission is to fuel the future of communications.</p><p>The Developer Network is the team at Twilio whose mission is to catalyze the network of developers who will build the future of communications. The DevNet is comprised of three teams that work closely with one another. Developer Evangelists inspire and equip developers by going to the language-centric and geographic communities where developers gather. Developer Educators challenge and empower developers by crafting world-class docs and training. Community Developers encourage and amplify developers by cultivating a core community of Twilio developers. Together, these three teams introduce developers to Twilio, help them get their projects shipped and build strong end enduring friendships with them.</p><p>Twilio is a company committed to your growth, your learning, your development and your entire employee experience. We only win when our employees succeed and we’re dedicated to helping you develop your strengths. We have a cultural foundation built on diversity, inclusion and innovation that we believe only gets better when your ideas thrive.</p><p></p><strong>Where</strong><p>This is a remote position. You can be based in a major metro area. &nbsp;While working remote you will still enjoy our incredible perks: a free Kindle when you build your Twilio app, monthly Kindle book reimbursement, monthly gym reimbursement, bi-weekly All Hands and more. &nbsp;Because you will collaborate with many people in Twilio HQ, you may need to travel to our San Francisco office 1-2 times per quarter. We also believe that in order to do this job well, you need a balanced work and home life. &nbsp;We offer generous PTO. What you will also get to experience is a company that believes in small teams for maximum impact; that strives to balance work and home life, that understands that this is a marathon, not a sprint; that continuously and purposefully builds an inclusive culture where everyone is able to do and be the best version of themselves. We seek people who naturally demonstrate our values, who are challenged by problems, empower others to thrive, people who can draw the owl and not be beholden to one playbook.</p><p></p><strong>About us:</strong><p></p><em>More than 2 million developers around the world have used Twilio to unlock the magic of communications to improve any human experience. Twilio has democratized communications channels like voice, text, chat, and video by virtualizing the world’s telecommunications infrastructure through APIs that are simple enough for any developer to use, yet robust enough to power the world’s most demanding applications.
