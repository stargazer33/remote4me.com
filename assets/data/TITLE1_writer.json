I work with entrepreneur and speaker Till H. Gross, and together we run Course Concierge. We’re an online course publishing house that develops courses for </span><em>NYT</em><span> best-selling authors, TED speakers, social media authorities and those with something to say.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our clients include YouTubers with 150,000,000 views, one of the most hotly-followed health experts on Instagram, and a coach to NFL athletes, NBA players and U.S. special forces.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Check us out here: </span><a href='http://courseconcierge.com' rel='nofollow'><span>http://courseconcierge.com</span></a></div><div><br></div><div><span>For the right person, this is a Dream Opportunity — and dream company. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re a year-and-a-half-old and growing, and looking for someone for a role that fuses Creative Director and Editor-in-Chief; someone who can oversee and orchestrate our productions – design, development, marketing, editorial and film.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Online courses, for the most part, have a lethargic reputation. Compared with today’s video games, things are still in the primitive stages; about as far evolved as </span><em>Pong</em><span>. But online courses’ possibilities are endless, and that’s something we’ve set to override. A book is a book. An online course is, well, anything you want it to be. There’s a promise of the internet that’s yet to be delivered, and we’d like to be its bearer. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Each production is a serious operation, and we have many going on at the same time. There’s a picture of U.S. chess champion Bobby Fischer at age 21 playing 50 games of chess simultaneously. We need someone who can match that in productions, on topics as varied as autism enterprises to cybersecurity to yoga, and each with its own multiple five-figure budget. You’d be overseeing productions at large, tasked with driving them forward with the team harmoniously.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Directing has a great reverence in film-making. We’d like someone who can help bring about the same in online education.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re a company that has our house in order, and we’ve structured things very deliberately. We have a </span><em>system</em><span>. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>And our early works have been supremely effective – we know how to drive action. The below is just one week following the release of “The Weekend Woodworker”, a course we helped produce with Steve Ramsey:</span></div><div><br></div><div><a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/BbKigoaH1VU/?taken-by=steveramsey_wwmm' rel='nofollow'><span>https://www.instagram.com/p/BbKigoaH1VU/?taken-by=steveramsey_wwmm</span></a></div><div><br></div><div><span>One heuristic for a course for strength coaches: “I’d happily have this person train my mum &amp; dad after taking this”. Another all-purpose: “Would I be comfortable selling this to my best friend?” (We need courses for which the answer is a resounding Yes!)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You need to have a definite interest in online learning, curriculum development and the future of education – and relish the prospect of crafting the best learning experience imaginable.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our ideal candidate...</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Is a strong leader. You can put pressure on the team to produce courses on time and know what a great product looks like.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Considers themselves a coach. We want someone who can get the very best out of everyone on the team – a nurturer.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Has a philosophy of learning. Our clients often want workbooks and quizzes. But how to do them in non-boring way? We want someone for whom, pent up from all the things you think wrong with the school educational system, wants to put things right with free rein to rewrite the rules. The opportunity to shake things up excites you.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Can be both a “maker” (rolling up your sleeves to do things) and a manager – able to switch between the two effortlessly.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Can guide smooth handoffs between team members, and push responsibility widely throughout the team while keeping a close eye to things.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Can hold their own with some seriously accomplished clientele. You’re ultimately culpable for the success and client experience of productions, and a client should be able to get you on the phone promptly (in the rare circumstance) they’re dissatisfied with something.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Is willing and able to recruit other course editors, continuing to build our brilliant team as we grow.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Is interested on all things on the horizon – AR, VR and other cutting edge technologies and how we might utilise them.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Can work with clients to ensure they get what they want, yet knows how to say “no” when necessary.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re a great company to join. Here’s why…</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- The company is still young (just 18 months) and you will be getting in at the ground level. This will be one of our most important positions, and crucial to making sure our next steps are the right ones.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Despite the company being young, we’ve a combined experience of several decades in publishing and online course creation. We have an unbelievably engaged team, with world-class people in every department, from video production to design to development to copywriting and editorial.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- We’ve got our ducks in a row. We have solid processes across the company (most strongly in production) and battle-proven workflows. The foundation is already there, so it’s yours to focus on building what we have.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Our clients are fantastic. We have the good fortune to be incredibly selective in who we work with, and a great many have a great sense of mission in what they do.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- We’re a remote company and you’ve the freedom to work from anywhere. Preferably we’re looking for someone in North America, but are open to candidates the world over. (Our current team spans 13 time zones.)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- We’re going places.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>*</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>This isn’t to be a typical job search.

Since 2012, Mercy Corps has worked to tackle Nigeria’s complex and evolving needs through a range of dynamic, multi-sector programs. In Northeast Nigeria, Mercy Corps is addressing the immediate humanitarian needs of vulnerable communities; enabling conflict-affected populations to transform from relief to resilience using market-driven approaches; and supporting community-led peace building efforts.</p><p><strong>Purpose / Project Description:</strong>&nbsp;As the impact of on-going hostilities has diminished in many areas of the Northeast, there is a window of opportunity to communicate to would-be defectors of Non- State Armed Groups (NSAG) complicit in the conflict that there are avenues to safely and peacefully reintegrate into communities. Equally as important is disseminating messaging around de-radicalization, rehabilitation and reintegration (DRR) programs to host communities to promote the acceptance of amnestied returning ex-combatants. Radio is king in the Lake Chad Basin region, an area comprising roughly 1.5 million square kilometers (approximately one third the size of the United States). High illiteracy rates, lack of infrastructure, extreme levels of poverty and an absence of mass communication technology that can reach target audiences in their native language, makes the development and use of radio to disseminate accurate and consistent information critical. Mercy Corps, through funding from the United States Department of State, is currently implementing the Using the Airwaves for Stability in the Lake Chad Basin (UAS LCB) Program. The program seeks to produce and air news, current affairs and special content programming on radio station(s) operating in the Lake Chad Basin to increase understanding of, and support for, the de-radicalization, rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-combatants. This program will result in reduced support for violence, and greater openness to reintegrating returning ex-combatants into communities.</p><p><strong>Consultant Objectives:</strong>&nbsp;Mercy Corps Nigeria is seeking a radio content developer to develop context-specific DRR content for radio broadcasts over a<strong>&nbsp;5-month period from August 2018 through December 2018&nbsp;</strong>(with the potential for a 1-year extension through 2019). Mercy Corps is currently collaborating with researchers from UCLA and Yale University to conduct a study on the most effective types of messaging used in DRR radio programming, and the results of this study will help inform the content to be developed. In order to have the greatest impact, radio content in both Hausa and Kanuri language will be required.</p><p><strong>Consultant Activities:</strong>&nbsp;The Consultant will develop radio content in Hausa and Kanuri to:</p><ul><li>Inform listeners of the existence of DRR strategies through regular news, current affairs and special programing content, including interviews with Nigerian policymakers, government officials, religious and community leaders</li><li>Profile the experiences of ex-combatants from non-state armed groups who have successfully left the on-going conflict, will include in-depth interviews</li><li>Provide debate and discussion programs to allow community members to express their views and experiences with conflict and violence, as well as their thoughts on the DRR process</li><li>Encourage discussion on the drivers of conflict in the Lake Chad Basin, including poor governance, identity-based marginalization, and weak rule of law on radio news, current affairs and special content programs</li><li>Create an alternative narrative using Kanuri history and culture that delegitimizes non-state armed group messaging around alignment of values, will include Kanuri text readings and interviews with Kanuri community leaders</li></ul><p><strong>Consultant Deliverables:</strong>&nbsp;The Consultant will:</p><ul><li>Develop a radio broadcast strategy and calendar detailing the radio content to be broadcast over a 5-month period from August through December 2018 (with the potential for a 1-year extension)</li><li>Create storyboards and synopses for the to-be-developed radio content for Mercy Corps’ review and approval.

    "content": "Who are Quill?<br />If you ask Deloitte Fast 50 or Santander Breakthrough50, they’d say we’re one of Britain’s most exciting and disruptive businesses. If you ask our team, they’d say we’re a no-politics, people-first company where exceptionally smart individuals get the chance to have their voice heard and potential fulfilled (then pushed that extra bit more). <br />And if you ask our clients, they’d say we’re the content production partner they rely on to rapidly create high-quality editorial, video and images to drive online sales. To date, we’ve produced over 40 million words of on-brand content – in 29 languages and counting – for 170+ of the world’s most prestigious brands, including eBay, Farfetch and Google. <br /><br />We do that through a combination of our unique methodology, our global network of ~2500 screened freelance creatives and Quill Cloud, our content production management tool.<br /><br />What does being a Community Manager at Quill involve?<br />In this brand new position, you’ll take a leading role in managing and engaging our global Network of 2,500+ creative and editorial freelancers. You’ll take ownership of innovating and implementing exciting Network-wide programmes, designed to make Quill the company freelancers want to work with. You’ll be responsible for proactively solving Network-focused problems, from individual issues to process flaws, and will set the standard for excellence in communication, both on a one-to-one basis when responding to queries and to the entire Network when launching new initiatives for them to take part in.<br /><br />These are the skills you’ll need for the job:<br />Change management skills: can plan and execute the successful implementation of large-scale changes that affect both in-house and remote teams<br /><br />Leadership: can motivate in-house and freelance colleagues to support on and participate in Network-focused initiatives<br /><br />Business nous and strategic thinking: can balance understanding of the needs of different elements of the business and develop and execute engagement strategies in line with these needs<br /><br />Analytic ability and enthusiasm for problem solving: can proactively and consistently analyse ways of working and embrace the opportunity to continually make things better<br /><br />Empathy paired with pragmatism: can instinctively empathise with others and balance the drive to help with a pragmatic assessment of the circumstances and the needs of all of your stakeholders<br /><br />Excellent one-to-one communication skills: can take active steps to understand the root of queries or issues and select the appropriate format for their expertly crafted comms – whether one-to-one or at a group level<br /><br />And here’s the experience you need:<br />You must have experience of developing an idea from initial concept to successful roll-out, including planning the project, getting buy-in from key stakeholders and managing the implementation process and the associated communications<br /><br />You must have experience of managing a large team or community, ideally with a number of remote individuals, and motivating them to deliver excellent results<br /><br />You must have a wealth of experience in handling tricky and sensitive communications – both one-to-one, and at a higher level<br /><br />Why should I join Quill? <br />Like most startups, we talk a lot about our culture. But for us, culture isn’t just words on a wall. It’s part of our recruitment process, our personal development plans and our day-to-day. <br /><br />If any of this sounds like you, you’re looking for a spot on the right team:<br />Your integrity isn’t for sale. You’re a what you see is what you get type of person who’s honest about their strengths and development areas. <br /><br />You don’t settle for second best. It really, really matters to you that everything you do is excellent. And you don’t shy away from empowering your colleagues to share those standards.<br /><br />10 minutes with nothing to do feels like an hour for you. You’re smart, energetic and driven, so you’re at your best when everything’s a little hectic.<br /><br />You don’t like going through the motions or blindly following instructions. You leap into complex situations that don’t have an easy answer and relish the challenge of coming up with one.<br /><br />The idea of a fixed ‘remit’ doesn’t appeal to you. Neither does waiting three years to get a promotion you earned two years ago. You think and act beyond your role. <br /><br />You’re a fundamentally kind, respectful person, searching for a place filled with similarly kind, respectful people.<br /><br />What are the benefits?<br />On top of joining the Quill family and all the benefits that come with that, you’ll also get:<br />25 holiday days per year plus UK bank holidays <br />A contributory pension <br />Our Summer Away Day (no stuffy meeting rooms in sight)<br />Monthly socials and lunches/breakfasts<br />Fortnightly Inspire Lunches – past lunches have included how the CEO manages his wellbeing, what today’s most disruptive businesses have in common and a crash course in Russian  <br />A significant amount of time, expertise and attention put into your personal development, plus an unusually broad scope for rapid career progression<br /><br />Quill is an equal opportunities employer."

We're expanding that to do a bit more content outreach – we'd like to reach more people online so they can learn how to stay safe while they browse. As a Content Writing Pioneer, you'll colonize the realm, working with the design and security team to write new copy for our blog, product web pages, and other marketing materials.<br /><br />What you'll do<br /><br />For the first 6 months as a content writer, you'll be expected to complete the following projects:<br /><br />Month 1<br /><br />- Read the 1Password style guide to learn how we communicate to our customers.<br />- Work with the design team to write copy for new features on 1Password.com.<br />- Refine existing content so it's consistent with our style guide and keywords. And make sure Matt's typos are fixed before it's updated.<br /><br />Month 3<br /><br />- Build relationships with the press through new releases and other announcements, and work with them to keep articles they've written accurate and up to date.<br />- Collaborate with other blogs on our existing blog posts so they can publish them.<br />- Draft press releases for new features, releases, and other 1Password news.<br />- Work with the security team to write articles about 1Password's security, educate our customers, and reach potential ones.<br /><br />Month 6<br /><br />- Continue creating new content for 1Password.com, press releases, blog posts, and other content you've been working on so far.<br />- Help improve traffic to landing pages on 1Password.com, working with the sales team on what potential customers are looking for in a password manager.<br />- Monitor popular keywords in online security and keep the ones on our blog and landing pages up to date.<br />- Try new things: We're a flat organization so you have the freedom to experiment with the ideas you've compiled in your little notebook up to this point.<br /><br />What you have<br /><br />- Communication skills that get people to understand, not just skim, what you're writing.<br />- A way of adapting those communication skills to new audiences with different styles and tones.<br />- Familiarity with keywords placement, meta descriptions, alt text, and your other favorite SEO buzzwords.<br />- A knack for learning things on your own and quickly adapting to new environments. Since 1Password is remote, it’s important to be independent in your research, but also have the humility to ask for help when you aren't sure about something.<br />- An inner compass that knows its way around Google Analytics.<br /><br />What you also might have<br /><br />- A year or so of experience writing copy, blog posts, and other content for an app or product you love.<br />- An acquaintence with Markdown, HTML, CSS, and perhaps Hugo.<br />- Personal experience with 1Password.<br /><br />Sounding like your cup of tea? Tell us your favorite tea."

In today’s world, your digital identity details are stored across thousands of servers in various places where you’ve registered an account. Ongoing large-scale hacks of stolen data in recent years have shown that big centralized stores of information pose serious security concerns.<br /><br />During recent ICO, Selfkey reached the 'Public Sale Max Cap' in 11 minutes, raising $22M in the public sale. Built on open-source technology, our products power various market and business use cases, such that; enable users to instantly and securely obtain citizenship and residency by investment, access hundreds of FinTech products and services, incorporate companies, open bank accounts, authorize to trade on exchange platforms, manage cryptocurrency portfolios & receive/send/store ETH (or any ERC-20 token), and more.<br /><br />We believe the future of identity management lies in utilizing blockchain technology because it’s decentralized, immutable, and protected by cryptography. You’ll be able to take full ownership of your personal data and identity, while sharing only the necessary information with other individuals or organizations. When it comes to crypto exchanges, financial products, and token sales - this can remove the often complex, repetitive, and redundant process of KYC/AML (Know Your Customer / Anti-Money Laundering). SelfKey makes this process simple, painless, and easy - we’ve been mentioned here, here, and here.<br /><br />Required Skills:<br />· Create content that promotes audience interaction<br />· Moderate all user-generated content<br />· Propose new ideas and concepts for social media content<br />· Collaborate with Marketing and Product teams to create social ‘buzz’ regarding new product launches<br />· Market Research<br />· Capture and analyze the appropriate social data/metrics, insights and best practices<br />· Collaborate with the marketing manager and internal teams on marketing strategy<br />· Provide administrative support to the marketing team<br />· Analyze questionnaires and other forms of feedback<br />- Manage our communities on Reddit, Twitter and Telegram <br />- Schedule & create relevant content to share on social media <br />- Daily posting & responding to messages on required Social Media channels<br /><br />Preferred Skills:<br />· Previous experience as a Community Manager managing groups of several thousand members<br />· Interest & basic knowledge of the Crypto & Blockchain space<br />· Video creation and editing skills (non essential but beneficial)<br />- Experience managing & growing a YouTube channel (non essential but beneficial)<br />- Social Media management experience<br />-Occasional work on weekends may be required to cover certain social channels<br />- Experience using Canva, Buffer and any other relevant social media tools"

Strangely enough I do not really know anyone using DA2.</p><p>Like PowerInsight, it is a handy tool to pinpoint location of data in Cerner Millennium database - DA2 comes with ready to use domains and a set of dimensions and measures.
