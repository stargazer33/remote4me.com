For more than 70 years, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists has bridged the divide between scientific research, global security, and public engagement.</p><p><strong>Position Description</strong></p><p>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is searching for an organized, creative, and committed assistant editor to help shape our coverage of nuclear weapons and other nuclear risk.</p><p>The successful candidate will be an efficient, organized, and talented editor of both long- and short-form magazine articles, able to focus on the big picture and get all the details right. The Bulletin is an all-digital publication, and successful candidates will have experience with Web and mobile content management systems, a knack for social networking, and familiarity with multimedia software, including audio and video editing programs.</p><p>The Bulletin’s authors are leading scientists and experts in their fields, which include nuclear energy and nuclear weapons, the fossil fuel use that drives climate change, and an array of other technologies that could, if misused, threaten humanity on a global scale. The assistant editor will work closely and collaboratively with the editor in chief and these experts to create compelling articles that are accessible to policy makers and lay audiences. All candidates must have an interest in the issues that we cover and national and international affairs generally. Experience editing in these fields is a definite advantage, but not required. All candidates must have excellent editing skills and the ability to work with high-profile writers and top experts. All of our editors are also expected to write for the Bulletin.</p><p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Candidates must be based in the United States.</strong></li><li><strong>Bachelor’s degree required.&nbsp;</strong>Candidates must hold a degree in journalism or other relevant discipline or profession; study in international affairs, public policy, or related discipline a plus.</li><li>Minimum of three solid years of journalism experience.</li><li>An understanding of WordPress or a similar content management system.</li><li>Experience with Final Cut Pro, the Adobe Creative Suite, and other multimedia software is a plus, as is a solid presence in social media.</li><li>Proficiency with common office productivity software (e.g., Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Adobe Acrobat, Office 365) required.</li><li>We are looking for a team player who is flexible and comfortable with multi-tasking.</li></ul><p>The Bulletin has a relatively small staff of brilliant, highly educated over-achievers; the assistant editor we hire will also have these qualities. Salary is commensurate with experience.&nbsp;<strong>This is a telecommuting position that can be performed anywhere in the United States, given that there is a strong internet connection. Preference will be given to candidates who live in Washington, DC. Overwhelmingly brilliant candidates from Europe and Asia will be considered.</strong></p><p>The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is an equal opportunity employer.

We consider our work our “art” and strive for excellence in</p><p>everything we do.</p><p><strong>Our Programs</strong></p><p>Adjacent to the annual Summit event, WBECS runs a number of learning programs in collaboration</p><p>with some of the coaching industry’s most respected and revered principle players:</p><p>• Coach Master Toolkit© (CMT) with Andrew Neitlich</p><p>• Narrative Coach (NC) with Dr. David Drake</p><p>• Conversational Intelligence® for Coaches (C-IQ) with the late, great Judith E. Glaser</p><p>• Coaching with Return on Investment (ROI) with Lisa Ann Edwards</p><p>• EthicalCoach (EC) - our non-profit initiative with a team including Marshall Goldsmith</p><p>Each of these programs/projects has its own, subtly-nuanced tone of voice, which, as our new</p><p>Copywriter, you would have to learn to adapt and adhere to.</p><p><strong>Our Tone of Voice</strong></p><p>The tone we wish to strike with our coaching community is warm, friendly and inviting. We pride</p><p>ourselves on not patronizing our audience. Our copy is designed to make the coach the star - not</p><p>ourselves. Sentences are concise - we try not to string too many thoughts together at once to</p><p>illustrate our clear intent and the benefits they will enjoy. The content we write talks to our coaches</p><p>- not at them. This creates a sense of intelligent, educated people in conversation with one another.</p><p><em><strong>An overview of working for us</strong></em></p><p>Our busiest times are always when we are about to launch a new program or event. A lot of materials</p><p>need to be written and prepared weeks in advance of the launch date. This is when you will find</p><p>your ‘To Do’ list runs pretty high. For example, for the relaunch of Narrative Coach in early 2019, a</p><p>total of 163 emails needed to be drafted. Not to mention accompanying web pages, social media</p><p>posts, blog posts and so on - and that is just one program. As well as our existing programs and</p><p>events, we are also piloting and planning to launch new ones too.</p><p>We will ask you to work hard, fast and to the best of your ability. As long as you are fully prepared</p><p>to do that, you will find working for WBECS very rewarding. Perks far outweigh the pitfalls. We</p><p>gather together once a year for our annual Company Retreat, giving you the opportunity to travel to</p><p>some spectacular locations. We offer the flexibility of remote working, to become a part of a</p><p>diverse, global team, and a competitive salary.</p><p><strong>Summary of the Copywriter Role</strong></p><p>Working closely with the Marketing Director and Lead Copywriter, you’ll be a master wordsmith</p><p>responsible for creating engaging copy for web pages, emails, social media and other marketing</p><p>materials across our full range of programs. Fast-paced work with quick turnarounds, you’ll be</p><p>flexible, creative and innovative.</p><p>The Ideal candidate will be able to work as part of a diverse team.

The World Business &amp; Executive Coach Summit (WBECS) takes place every year and is highly regarded by coaching professionals worldwide.</p><p>You’d be working with those who coach the elite of the business world – names like Richard Branson, Steve Jobs, and Elon Musk. Development experts who guide companies like NASA and World Bank to greatness – those are the coaches we work with personally to help get their amazing thought leadership out to the world.</p><p>Due to our fast growth, we are looking for an exceptional new  to join us.</p><strong>Copywriter</strong><p>We run the largest online event for coaches () with 50 of the top thought leaders for the coaching industry, and in addition to this, we also launch individual programmes such as Narrative Coach and Conversational Intelligence for Coaches. We also have a philanthropic mission, which takes the form of EthicalCoach ().</p><a href='http://www.wbecs.com' rel='nofollow'>www.wbecs.com</a><a href='http://www.ethicalcoach.org' rel='nofollow'>www.ethicalcoach.org</a><p></p><em></em><strong>Our Mission and our Culture</strong><p>Our mission at WBECS is to raise the global standard of coaching by providing executive coacheswith the highest quality content available in the industry. WBECS is a growing remote global workforce, we are truly passionate about our people!</p><p>This is not your typical office job. Our passionately-engaged, global team works 100% remotely and collaborates vigorously. The lifestyle design is flexible but full on; and the culture is fast-paced. We consider our work our “art”, striving for excellence in everything we do. “We consider ourselves as family and  an inside look at some of the family fun.” The lifestyle design is flexible, but full on and the culture is fast-paced. We consider our work our “art” and strive for excellence in everything we do.</p><a href='https://vimeo.com/319954647/da12bd951d' rel='nofollow'>here’s</a><p></p><strong>Our Programs</strong><p>Adjacent to the annual Summit event, WBECS runs a number of learning programs in collaboration with some of the coaching industry’s most respected and revered principle players:</p><ul></ul><li>Coach Master Toolkit© (CMT) with Andrew Neitlich</li><li>Narrative Coach (NC) with Dr. David Drake</li><li>Conversational Intelligence® for Coaches (C-IQ) with the late, great Judith E.

We pride ourselves on not patronizing our audience. Our copy is designed to make the coach the star – not ourselves. Sentences are concise – we try not to string too many thoughts together at once to illustrate our clear intent and the benefits they will enjoy. The content we write talks to our coaches – not at them. This creates a sense of intelligent, educated people in conversation with one another.</p><p></p><em></em><strong>An overview of working for us</strong><p>Our busiest times are always when we are about to launch a new program or event. A lot of materials need to be written and prepared weeks in advance of the launch date. This is when you will find your ‘To Do’ list runs pretty high. For example, for the relaunch of Narrative Coach in early 2019, a total of 163 emails needed to be drafted. Not to mention accompanying web pages, social media posts, blog posts and so on – and that is just one program. As well as our existing programs and events, we are also piloting and planning to launch new ones too.</p><p>We will ask you to work hard, fast and to the best of your ability. As long as you are fully prepared to do that, you will find working for WBECS very rewarding. Perks far outweigh the pitfalls. We gather together once a year for our annual Company Retreat, giving you the opportunity to travel to some spectacular locations.

This retailer specializes in computers, cameras and all related equipment, but they also sell televisions, speakers, media players, gaming consoles, telescopes, audio/video equipment, and other tech-related products. While you don't need to be a &quot;geek&quot; to make this work, it would probably help. Otherwise, bring your A-game when it comes to research!</p><p>Packaging: this project consists of writing and editing 300-word landing page copy for a B2B packaging company. We'll be writing for enterprise-level customers, with our client selling bottles, jars, and other product packaging. While you don't have to be in the industry to do this work, experience with ecommerce writing and solid researching skills will help!</p><p>Tools and Home Improvement: this project consists of writing and editing 60-100, 125-150, or 300-400 words of content for a short category pages, long category pages, and product descriptions. Copy will focus on home improvement products and categories, such as tools, appliances, lighting, hardware, gardening, and more.</p><p>What's a landing page? It's a webpage that showcases a particular category of products, such as camera lens covers, Playstation 4 games, or mason jars. Our job is to write copy that will help shoppers learn about the products: what they are, the important features and/or benefits, what they need to know when making a purchase, etc.</p><p>What's a product description? It's website copy that describes a specific product. It's generally broken up into paragraph copy and 3-5 bullets. Its purpose is to introduce a shopper to the product's particular features and benefits.

We are building a global personal-publishing business that brings millions of people into our products – as co-creators and audiences We are best known for our first title, Lost My Name, which is read by over 4 million children and their families globally. We are releasing a new title every few months and now have 18 books in our range.</p><p>Our focus in the near future is with the children’s book market – creating stunning, uncompromisingly high quality and technically ambitious personalised books for kids.</p><p>We’re in the business of sparking kids’ imaginations; inspiring them to read &amp; to learn as well as build confidence and self-belief. May 2019 sees a relaunch of our website and material to back up that positioning.</p><p><strong>About the role</strong></p><ul><li><strong>2-4 hours per week</strong></li><li><strong>Remote – good internet connection required</strong></li><li>Start ASAP</li><li>£25/€29 per hour</li></ul><p>Wonderbly is looking for wonderful Dutch-speaking editors/proof-readers, who can work closely with our copywriters to ensure the highest standard content for our international markets.</p><p>It’s our editor’s job to ensure that the copy we use across all our comms to customers is on brand, appropriately localised and free of errors.</p><p>It’s a chance to help to create humorous, lively and all-around-fun copy for a company that is dedicated to making children more clever, curious and kind (and making them laugh, too).</p><p><strong><u>What you will do</u></strong></p><p>The role is to edit/proof-read content written by our marketing copywriters. The proofing is to ensure there are no errors in the copy but also to feedback on the quality and content of what is written.</p><p>Whilst our copywriters generally retain the final call on what is written, our editors offer support in ideas on how to improve the copy and ensure that it is suitable for the audience in that particular market.</p><p>We expect our copywriters and editors to work in quite a collaborative way but are flexible in what this means for each language team.</p><p>All of the content is for marketing, brand and editorial purposes across our website and digital marketing channels. Therefore having an editor with experience working with e-commerce brands and with an understanding of paid marketing channels such as Facebook and PPC is a huge benefit.</p><p>In addition to this, our editors should, of course, know their market extremely well – preferably from the view point of digital marketing.<br>The three main kinds of content that you’ll be working on are…</p><ul><li><u><strong>Website</strong></u><ul><li>As an e-commerce company, our website is our shop and needs to communicate who we are and what we do. Our tone of voice is important to us, and should be consistently upheld across the website.</li><li>At the same time, each locale should have a tailor fit approach to give our customers the best possible experience, no matter where they live. In addition, the purchase journey should be as smooth as possible – enabling customers to make a pain free purchase and leave them wanting to come back again and again!</li></ul></li><li><strong><u>Paid marketing + Email</u></strong><ul><li>We tell our audiences about our books across performance marketing channels such as Facebook and PPC/Google Search. The ideal candidate would have experience editing for a similar brand across digital marketing platforms – and have knowledge of the markets in order to successfully cover relevant keywords and messaging, as well as bringing ideas for fresh content. In addition, we regularly communicate with our customers via email to let them know about product releases, editorial blog content and our trade events. The tone across all of these needs to remain consistent and on brand – written to entice and entertain our existing customers.</li></ul></li><li><strong><u>Trade Events</u></strong><ul><li>Alongside launching new products, one of our biggest areas of new copy each month is for trade events. These are one-off campaigns we run around a specific theme, for example, World Book Day or Summer Reading. These events usually mean a promotion that is run onsite and via email. We update the website to revolve around this theme so we have updates to copy on the website, email and across social media.</li></ul></li><li><strong><u>Editorial content</u></strong><ul><li>Finally, we also like to regularly post longer form editorial blog content such as craft activities or listicle posts which summarise the uniqueness of our products. This content aims to engage our audience and is a softer approach to increasing brand awareness – so calls for a slightly different style and tone.</li></ul></li></ul><p>* This is not an exhaustive list of the content that may require editing but summarises the main areas of copy</p><p><strong><u>Requirements</u></strong></p><ul><li>Minimum 4 years mid-level experience in the specified language</li><li>Demonstrable skills editing or writing across all digital media – including Facebook ads and social media posts, blog entries etc.</li><li>Experience writing or editing content for the children’s gift/book market an advantage</li><li>Whilst not necessary an understanding of what parents are looking for – potentially a parent, aunt/uncle, grandparent!</li><li><strong>Flexibility with part-time work and able to work remotely (so a good internet connection is essential)</strong></li><li>A good team worker and happy to communicate mostly via email and occasional video calls</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.backstage.wonderbly.com/dutch-speaking-editor' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

While you don't have to be in the industry to do this work, experience with ecommerce writing and solid researching skills will help!</p><p>What's a landing page? It's a webpage that showcases a particular category of products; for this project, it would be things like mason jars, amber glass bottles, or childproof pharmaceutical packaging. Our job is to write copy that will appear at the top of bottom of the page to help shoppers learn about the products: what they are, general features and/or benefits, what they need to know when making a purchase, etc.</p><p>What's a product description? It's website copy that describes a specific product. It's generally broken up into paragraph copy and 3-5 bullets. Its purpose is to introduce a shopper to the product's particular features and benefits. Unlike category page content that might focus on amber glass jars in general, a product description will focus on a specific product, such as a 4-ounce straight-sided amber glass jar.</p><p>We have a full style guide available that explains everything more clearly and can answer any questions you have, so don't worry if you're unsure or confused about what we're looking for.</p><p>We need people who:</p><p>-- Are fluent in English as their first language<br>-- Have experience writing and/or editing ecommerce copy (SEO experience a plus!)<br>-- Can follow instructions<br>-- Can positively accept and apply feedback<br>-- Can stick to deadlines<br>-- Will only submit unique content<br>-- Can and are willing to do research when required<br>-- Can accept payment via PayPal on a weekly basis</p><p>If you have the time and ability to help, please reach out ASAP. We have work available NOW and need immediate help. This is a freelance position, but we have plenty to keep you busy. Pay varies per project and role, but writing projects are in the range of 3 to 5 cents per word.</p><p>If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

    "content": "<p><em>Suit Human Resources, Recruitment, Talent Acquisition or Org Psych Background.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Arielle Executive is Australia's leading executive-level human marketing &amp; personal branding agency and we’re rapidly growing.<br><br>There is an exciting opportunity for a talented professional (with a background in Talent Acquisition, HR or Organisational Psychology) who is passionate about the power of the written word and its ability to sell, and who has knowledge of the recruitment and selection market, to join our small, nimble and highly capable team in the capacity of an Executive Brand Builder | Writer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHO ARE YOU?</strong></p><p>To succeed, you must GENUINELY be interested in people and leaders, delighting in their psychology and what makes them tick, marvelling at how they fit into what they do. This needs to be more than just a box-ticking job for you - you must have an innate desire to help shape and mould clients' unique histories to fit their next career goal. And a deep love affair with the English language is an absolute must.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHAT WILL YOU BE DOING?</strong></p><p>Your role will be to partner with our Consultants to execute the strategic brief for the client, as such positioning our clients as a unique answer to a clearly defined set of commercial challenges. Achieving this will require weaving together points of interest from the client's career to form a cohesive story, so that each of their career moves is strategically relevant and aligned to their intended direction. You will then use this narrative as a departure point for the creation of their resume, LinkedIn profile and other online assets, within which you'll articulate their value proposition. This suite of products then works as a congruent, multi-touch point, branded system to help them attract, and successfully compete for, top leadership roles.</p><p>You'll be drawing upon your well honed analytical and critical-thinking skills to tie together disparate layers of information by assessing it in the context of the bigger picture, in order to build the strongest business case possible for the client on their behalf. It’s imperative that you're the type of person who looks at problems from a variety of angles and that you have a broad understanding of business concepts. We take the responsibility we're given very seriously. We market people; their livelihoods depend on the work we do. As such, being highly tuned to commercial contexts and the needs of the person doing the recruiting, as well as the individual – i.e. being able to put yourself in all shoes – is vital.</p><p><br><strong>WHAT DOES IT TAKE?</strong></p><p>If you’re wired to build convincing arguments, and are often told that your talents have been wasted (i.e. you should have been a lawyer or a politician), this role will fit like a glove. You need to love the idea of sculpting and moulding your client’s experience to suit their direction, overlaying and aligning who they are and what they do with their goal in order to secure buy in from the reader.</p><p>Those who work best in our culture love to learn (i.e. not just say that they love to learn. The daily growth required within this role is challenging) and thrive in environments where they continuously push themselves to new heights. If you shriek at the sight of feedback – you will find our culture difficult. We all provide feedback to one another – and are happy to receive it too. We genuinely care about our clients so won’t be afraid to say that something can be improved upon. And we want you to be OK with that too, so accountability, integrity and resilience are paramount. You must be an avid believer in there always being a better way, and importantly, be willing to find it. Our products are always in a state of continuous evolution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?</strong></p><p>We love what we do. We’re a tightly knit and high performing team, and working with us you will do some of your best work. It is important to note however that being a part of remote team is a little different to being part of a team where you see your colleagues day in and day out. There are no water cooler conversations, no office Ping-Pong table (though there are plenty of other perks). Therefore, you MUST be fulfilled when you feel EMPOWERED to do your very BEST WORK. Our top talent have a deep passion for their craft, and LOVE to work remotely so that they can focus on the work itself – because this is something that they revel in.</p><p>For the right person, there will be an opportunity to progress to consulting, leading and driving brand discovery sessions with our executive clientele and advising on strategy regarding their positioning - both online and offline. This role will enable you to build a strong foundation. You'll learn the ropes, and understand what it is we do as well as how we do it, fusing marketing and branding with human resources and commercial acumen. Ample training and development will be provided to ensure that you succeed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS:</strong></p><ul><li><p>will only consider applicants with a HR, Talent Acquisition, Recruitment, Organisational Psychology, OR consulting experience;</p></li><li><p>you've always been an &quot;academic&quot;, and proud of your ability to analyse and write about your subject; you will have an 2:1 or above in English Literature, Psychology or Arts based Degree;</p></li><li><p>you can write using incredibly polished, intelligent &quot;business&quot; language. Experience in writing business cases, proposals, and/or thought leadership articles is desirable;</p></li><li><p>you're a natural storyteller; with the power to connect disparate pieces of information to create compelling narratives;</p></li><li><p>you understand transferable people competencies, skills and abilities, and can align experience/personal fit for specific jobs;</p></li><li><p>you're someone who can always &quot;spin&quot; an argument, and a passion for building cases that influence and convince;</p></li><li><p>a broad understanding of business concepts and a capacity to comprehend the challenges international executives face is essential – do you read HBR?</p></li><li><p>Time management and discipline– if you’re always running out of time, please don’t apply. You must be able to commit to 2 business day turnarounds – non negotiable;</p></li><li><p>a knack for research - able to pick out key concepts from a lot of information.</p></li></ul>",

We currently have a list of around 2000 companies with some information about each of them. This information includes: website, company name, LinkedIn company profile, and the city and country the headquarters are in. We also have the name of the founder and the contact details for these companies.   <br>   <br>The directory could possibly use an existing WordPress plugin. Here is an example of a similar type of directory: https://saasmag.com/2019-list/.   <br>   <br>The directory will need the following features:   <br>   <br>* The ability for us to add all of the companies we already have.   <br>   <br>* The ability for a company to add themselves.   <br>   <br>* The ability for companies to log in.   <br>   <br>* The ability to email companies a link which will allow them to log in and update their directory listing.   <br>   <br>* A MailChimp signup form embedded on the page.   <br>   <br>* The ability to search the list for a particular company.   <br>   <br>* An admin site to edit entries.   <br>   <br>* The ability to add lists of new companies in the admin site.   <br>   <br>* A list of all of the companies.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>The following fields are to be included on the company profile page:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Company Name   <br>   <br>* Company Description   <br>   <br>* Country   <br>   <br>* Number of Employees   <br>   <br>* Name of the CEO/Founder   <br>   <br>* Position   <br>   <br>* Website Link   <br>   <br>* LinkedIn Company Profile Link   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>TO BE THE BEST MATCH FOR THIS JOB, YOU MUST HAVE EXCELLENT SKILLS IN:   <br>   <br>   <br>* WordPress development (If you will not be using WordPress then PHP is preferred.)   <br>   <br>* Design   <br>   <br>* Project management   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We expect this job to be completed in the following stages:   <br>   <br>Stage 1: Decide what technology to use. (For example, which WordPress plugin). Create the directory design. Receive our approval for the design.   <br>   <br>Stage 2: Create the directory backend and upload it to our servers.   <br>   <br>Stage 3: Upload all of the existing companies to the directory. Create a spreadsheet with a list of all the companies and the link/instructions of how they can update their listings. In this stage, we will do some additional quality assurance for the site to make sure it is working properly.   <br>   <br>Additional Points:   <br>   <br>* The design must look amazing.   <br>   <br>* If we are not happy with Stage 1, we will not continue on to Stage 2.   <br>   <br>* We expect Stage 1 to be very low cost. Most of the cost will be incurred in the creation of the directory (Stage 2).   <br>   <br>  </div> </div>",

But teaching people how to get control of their money and changing lives one budget at a time is what gets us up in the morning. We want to grow our reach even further, and we’re looking for a versatile writer we can entrust with one of our most valuable assets: <strong>The YNAB Voice.</strong></p><p>You are a natural storyteller—funny and creative—but you understand the importance of the business objectives behind the message. We know this because you artfully tucked the CTA right behind the first joke. #nailedit! Cheesy doesn’t scare you, because you can dad joke #likeaboss.</p><p>Not only are you swift and mighty with your pen, you are always jotting down ideas and pitching new approaches. The marketing team will quickly consider you a huge creative asset and wonder how they ever got on without you. Which gives you an idea for a blog post…</p><p>Without ever sacrificing quality, you understand the role of SEO, optimization, and conversion copy approaches. You strike the balance (and sometimes a pose) with ease.</p><p>You can shift gears—blog posts, landing pages, email courses, ad campaigns, newsletters, video scripts, perhaps even a parody song or two—because regardless of the format, you can crack yourself up and nail the headline without breaking a sweat.</p><p><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</strong></p><ul><li>Prolific writer with a sense of humor and experience thriving under daily deadline pressure</li><li>Did we mention a sense of humor? (Because if you haven’t already thought to yourself how hilarious this job posting reads, well,…)</li><li>Unintimidated and energized at the prospect of writing 5-15 pieces of content per week (depending on variables like story type, length, complexity, weather, etc.)</li><li>Proven ability to produce high-quality content across genres (practical how-tos, researched deep dives, customer profiles, first-person narrative, pop psychology, etc.)</li><li>Idea generating machine who considers the implications of SEO, trends, multiple audiences/platforms, larger goals with every piece of content, as naturally as breathing (and, OK, fine, yes—probably has a little flair for the dramatic)</li><li>Excellent time management skills which make juggling—multiple projects, daily, weekly and monthly deadlines, and an always changing assortment of story types—look easy</li><li>Desire to help lead overall content strategy</li></ul><p>That gives you a pretty good idea of the job, but first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. (We think you will.)</p><p><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></p><p>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (Google us, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our Cultural Manifestohas to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</p><p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p><p><strong>Lindsey &amp; The Gang </strong>aka the Marketing Team aka just a rag-tag but lovable bunch of underdogs who defy the odds—making budgeting software hilarious, emotional, and accessible—day in and day out. (Disney, are you listening?)</p><p>We love musical theater, board games, stand-up comedy, the Enneagram, video games, and art, to varying degrees, depending on who you talk to first. Our internal Slack channel is so much fun, it has a growing fanbase.</p><p>Lindsey, our Chief Marketing Officer, will be the first to delete something very important, but also the first to celebrate your wins—big and small. Ryan, our Digital Marketing Director, will quickly become your lifeline in any type of bracketology-related emergency and even under website-launch-level-stress, he can sneak in the jokes that make you feel like, “if Dad’s OK, we’ll all be OK.”</p><p>And then there’s, Ben B. and Janelle, who lead out on Community Engagement and Social Media, respectively. They both have huge hearts, and a tangible passion for our customers, plus they are hilarious. Reema, our Marketing Manager, keeps all the balls in the air, while wearing many different hats, basically, if there is a need, yo, she’ll solve it (and yes, that was a seamless incorporation of Vanilla Ice lyrics).</p><p>Plus, our brilliant creatives, Lauren and Marian (designers), Tristan (animation), and Hannah (video), who bring everything to life. They are a veritable idea machine who serve to make us look good on a daily basis. What more could a writer ask for?</p><p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></p><p><strong>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. </strong>Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too. Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay because we’re all adults. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Christmas break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong>The YNAB Meetup</strong></p><p><strong>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and most recently, Laguna Beach. We do really fun things, but the highlight always seems to be just hanging out together and having a blast.</strong></p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.</p><p><strong>International is Absolutely Okay</strong></p><p><strong>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor.</strong> Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</p><p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></p><p>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em> <em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.</p><p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you accomplish, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not <em>think</em> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping YNAB customers achieve success. You will change lives. I’ll only say that six more times.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Marketing Content Writer…</strong></p><p>Before ‘content marketing’ and ‘social media’ were buzzwords, YNAB’s marketing efforts were anchored in content and community. And we’re doubling down.</p><p>Considering the size of our current team, we pump out a remarkable amount of content, but we are looking for a sharp, creative, curious storyteller to help us take it to the next level.</p><p>You are marketing-minded and love nothing more than nailing a message with the kind of laser focus that pierces the hearts of your target audience. Sure, you can (and do!) pull direction from the data, but you excel at all-the-feelings that make storytelling such a powerful tool.</p><p>You have a solid understanding of content marketing, social media marketing, and lead generation. Of course, you are an excellent writer and editor, but even more than that you understand that it is the <em>right </em>content, for the <em>right</em> audience, in the <em>right</em> context, that converts to sign-ups.</p><p><strong>You are our ideal candidate if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Have at least 3-5 years of professional writing experience with a portfolio that showcases hitting daily or near-daily publication deadlines.</li><li>Can nail the YNAB voice, but also have a distinct voice all your own.</li><li>Excel at juggling multiple projects and timelines at any given moment and switching gears, keeps you fresh and stimulated.</li><li>Write engaging blog content of all shapes and sizes (first person narrative, educational, inspirational, practical/how-to).</li><li>Write emails that get opened, ads that are clicked on, and landing pages that convert.</li><li>Write snappy ad copy, educational scripts, and who knows, maybe even an e-book or a 6-week course for a niche audience. We’re full of surprises—can you write them?</li><li>Establish strategies and processes for optimizing and repurposing/republishing content to improve SEO and increase sign-ups</li><li>The possibilities are endless, but we want someone who is pumped to help craft the strategy and then write the thing. (All the things!)</li><li>Make us laugh.</li><li>Manage your time exceptionally well and comfortable working remotely.</li><li>Incredibly organized, flexible, and collaborative.</li><li>Never met a deadline you didn’t love.</li><li>Self-motivated and driven by nature, maybe even a little competitive.</li><li>Stay laser-focused on the big picture, without losing sight of every. last. detail.</li><li>Wildly productive and independent, but a team-player at heart.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></p><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li><li>You live on or around the West Coast. We’ll double down for California or Washington. (Not a requirement, just bonus points!)</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0jelh' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
