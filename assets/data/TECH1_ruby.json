    "content": "We’re looking for an experienced Rails developer to work on the software platform that powers our conferences and meetups, and supports our growing community of software developers.<br /><br />*Who are you?*<br /><br />You’re a senior software developer with strong experience building and running Ruby/Rails applications, looking for a role that puts you right at the heart of the software community.<br /><br />You’ll play a key role in maintaining and improving our existing applications, and help to shape our technology strategy.<br /><br />We’re not looking for a rock star, we’re looking for somebody who wants to be part of a great team - pairing, mentoring, collaborating. <br /><br />When things break, we’ll fix them together. When we ship great stuff, we’ll celebrate together!<br /><br />*What’s our tech stack?*<br /><br />Our platform is Rails 4, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch and Redis. The web frontend is Zurb Foundation, jQuery and CSS3.<br /><br />Code is in GitHub, our build pipeline runs on CircleCI and all our production systems run on Heroku, monitored using Logentries, Rollbar and NewRelic.<br /><br />Ideally, you know what all those things are and you’ve worked with most of them. Maybe you already have some ideas about how we could use them more effectively.<br /><br />We’ve also got standalone projects ranging from visualization tools built using React and Rails APIs, to a bespoke pipeline for deploying Go apps to Raspberry Pi touchscreen devices around our venue.<br /><br />*How we work*<br /><br />We aspire to be agile and test-driven - but we’re also pragmatists who try not to get too hung up on textbook definitions. <br /><br />On Monday mornings we review work in flight, pick up new stories, and decide what our focus for the week is going to be. We work on short-lived feature branches, we write unit and integration tests. We merge code as soon as it’s been reviewed and we deploy to production several times a day. On Friday afternoons, we review progress and share ideas for what we could do differently next time.<br /><br />*What’s it like working here?*<br /><br />With four developers and two product owners, we’re still a relatively small development team, but we’re part of a diverse, enthusiastic company of around fifty people (growing to 150 in the next 18 months) hailing from all over the world.<br /><br />You’ll be working at our office in Liverpool Street, London.

We are a small team, so the ideal team member would be comfortable taking on various tasks and seeing them to completion.

I started the company with a simple mission - to have fun building things for people that pay us to do it - pretty simple. So far, it's worked out pretty well. Since 2007, we've worked with many many clients large and small with many different types of applications - some easy and some challenging. Most of our work has been with Ruby on Rails projects and within the last couple years, we've also have had a few Elixir projects too - though the client adoption has been slower. Our preferred stack is Ruby on Rails / Elixir Phoenix on the backend and Vue.js on the front-end.</div><div><br></div><div>And not much has changed in that respect in the past eleven years - we have a healthy set of clients that we work with daily. All of our projects are organized and managed in Asana (https://asana.com). A typical day would be working on the cards you are assigned too, submitting pull requests for peer review, and moving the cards through the kanban board until delivery. All of our clients are on Asana too and are readily available to answer any questions. In some cases, we also have our clients in designated channels in Slack so they feel like they are part of the development team too. Those are basically the only two tools we use for communication.</div><div><br></div><div>We really try to keep focus, as much as possible, on the code. So we keep the meetings to a minimum and have one standup meeting a week via&nbsp;GotoMeeting&nbsp;video conferences. I also meet with individual team members for 1:1 meetings twice a month for a half hour to check-in on how your doing, address any issues, discuss professional goals etc. We have an office in Ohio, but most people work remotely including me - I am 100% remote in Seattle.</div><div><br></div><div>A few benefits worth mentioning:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Work Remotely from Anywhere</div><div>2. Health, Dental, Life Insurance and Vision Coverage</div><div>3. 401(k) through Guidance</div><div>4. Monthly Gym Reimbursement</div><div>5. Three week vacations to start - four weeks after the first year of employment.</div><div>6. Flexible schedule - no overtime ever.</div><div>7. 100% of expenses when you speak at conferences.</div><div>8. Small, caring team always willing to help and your contributions make a big impact.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm always working hard to add more benefits as the company grows so this list is ever growing and changing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We also have internal projects we work on as well. One is RubyRags (http://rubyrags.com), a fun little tee shirt business. And the other one I am very excited about that we're currently designing is a web app&nbsp;that helps automate&nbsp;devop&nbsp;operations and code deployments. It's my dream to get a product we can use internally and be able to share it with the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you,</div><div>Matt Sears</div><div>Owner of Littlelines</div><div><br></div>            </div><div>How to apply:<br><a href='https://littlelines.com/apply' rel='nofollow'>littlelines.com/apply</a></div>"

We’re working with ICOs, exploring the identity space, and looking forward to open-sourcing financial technology, which is desperately lacking appropriate and inclusive international standards.</p><p>Fractal’s 6-strong engineering team is known for its sky-high standards and aspirations. Software is hard, and we know it takes curiosity, passion, discipline, and patience to get it right.</p><p><strong>Your Profile</strong></p><p>There's a specific kind of person we're looking for. We understand we’re describing a rare breed, so it’s ok if you don’t meet all these requirements.</p><ul><li>You consider yourself a senior software engineer, and so do all of you peers.</li><li>You understand that “move fast and break things” is only a good philosophy when what you build is inconsequential.</li><li>You're excited to break out of an application's code and think about the system as a whole (tweaking nginx configs, thinking about load balancers, worrying about queues and their throughput).</li><li>You're the person your friends turn to when they hear about that new tech in Hacker News. They do that because you’re up to speed with the current trends and great at breaking down complex technology in a way that your juniors can grasp.</li><li>Someone at our team has done mutation testing by hand because they’re that careful about things. You don’t think this is crazy, and maybe have done the same yourself.</li><li>You get really angry if someone tries to takes away your agile, or your tests, or your continuous delivery, or.... You get the point.</li></ul><p><strong>Our values</strong></p><p>It’s always difficult to accurately write about one’s values in a way that captures their subtlety, but here's a decent start. We can chat more about it during the application process.</p><ul><li>Gather great talent: Have the best peers you could ask for, people you can continuously teach and learn with. We know A-players want to work with other A-players.</li><li>Enforce transparency: Every decision's process is documented in the clear, all information is available to everyone (to the extent of the law).</li><li>Include everyone: Consider all ideas from anyone. Even if it isn't your area of expertise, we encourage you to ask questions and contribute in any way you feel inclined.</li><li>Don't worry about salaries: We want our engineers thinking about code, not money. All engineers get paid enough to live a comfortable lifestyle.</li><li>Promote authenticity: We have an informal environment, and we believe getting along well is fundamental. Everyone's different and we're going to spend a third of our lives together, so we make sure everyone feels welcome.</li></ul><h3>Main requirements</h3><ul><li><p>You've built at least a handful of websites by now, of which at least one really challenged your software design skills and dealt with more than 10 concurrent users</p></li><li><p>DFA, BFS, DFS, A: these are not just words for you. You might not be totally in the know, but you'd know where to start. You can reason about algorithmic complexity and know which trade-offs to make</p></li><li>Your education and years of experience don’t matter but, when we speak, we need to feel like you’ve been doing this forever.</li><li><p>We build our web applications mostly in <strong>Ruby/Rails</strong> for the back-end and <strong>JavaScript/React</strong> for the front-end. We also have a bunch of services running <strong>Go.</strong> Our infra is docker-containerized and sits on <strong>AWS</strong> (Fargate/ECS and RDS PostgreSQL) and is managed through <strong>Terraform</strong>. We work with <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>Ethereum</strong> (and <strong>Solidity</strong>), and <strong>Lisk</strong>.</p></li></ul><h3>Nice to have</h3><ul><li>Understanding of blockchain technology, distributed systems, and cryptography.</li></ul><h3>Perks</h3><ul><li>Remote work, flexible hours, world-class engineering team</li></ul><p></p>"

SOAP is (unfortunately) used by many operator APIs, which is why we released our open source library, LolSoap.</div><div><br></div><div>Some of the most difficult challenges we face relate to routing and making sense of lots of data. Which routes are best to get from A to B? Which booking systems should be queried? How might we cache data without affecting accuracy of results?</div><div><br></div><div>We’ve recently released mobile applications for iOS and Android.

What does this mean? Well, say you’re a shopper who’s looking for a new watch. You are on your phone shopping around when you add a new timepiece to a cart on an online store. At that moment, you realize that you left your wallet in your car. As you’re already in bed for the night, you close out of the store. This is where&nbsp;</span><span>Consistent Cart</span><span>&nbsp;comes in. You then receive an email that is a reminder to purchase the watch – then a message directly through Facebook messenger the next day when it’s a more convenient time to check out. You check out and the store makes their sale that otherwise would have been lost.<br></span></div><div></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p><a href='mailto:jrbapna@gmail.com' rel='nofollow'>jrbapna@gmail.com</a></p>  </div>"

We work closely with Shopify expanding the native functionality with bespoke Rails apps that leverage Shopify’s extensive API, as well as building fully-custom front-end experiences. We are a core Partner of Shopify, with advance access to upcoming APIs and features, and are always looking to push the boundaries of what companies understand Shopify being able to achieve.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Our team is small with steady growth and fully distributed, and working remotely has been part of our DNA since Day 1. This means you will find a great remote working environment focused around making your day-to-day enjoyable and efficient, both through excellent tooling (Slack, Rubymine), and a remote-only culture.</div><div>As part of a remote team, we encourage finding a setup that provides both the work productivity and lifestyle that suits everyone, even if that is something completely different for each person. Without geographic constraints, time and location can be flexible to fit around each team member’s needs.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As our clients are also remote, we occasionally travel to spend time embedded in their offices, and this can also provide time as a team to come together. Outside of these trips, we also organise an annual meetup to bring everyone together for a few days to get away from our desks, bridge the remote-working gap, and plan for the future direction of the company - this year the team came together for a week in Hong Kong, whilst previous years have included California and Miami.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The company has evolved around a few core principles: quality over quantity, under-promise and over-deliver, and taking pride in your work.

We work closely with Shopify expanding the native functionality with bespoke Rails apps that leverage Shopify’s extensive API, as well as building fully-custom front-end experiences. We are a core Partner of Shopify, with advance access to upcoming APIs and features, and are always looking to push the boundaries of what companies understand Shopify being able to achieve.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Our team is small with steady growth and fully distributed, and working remotely has been part of our DNA since Day 1. This means you will find a great remote working environment focused around making your day-to-day enjoyable and efficient, both through excellent tooling (Slack, Rubymine), and a remote-only culture.</div><div>As part of a remote team, we encourage finding a setup that provides both the work productivity and lifestyle that suits everyone, even if that is something completely different for each person. Without geographic constraints, time and location can be flexible to fit around each team member’s needs.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As our clients are also remote, we occasionally travel to spend time embedded in their offices, and this can also provide time as a team to come together. Outside of these trips, we also organise an annual meetup to bring everyone together for a few days to get away from our desks, bridge the remote-working gap, and plan for the future direction of the company - this year the team came together for a week in Hong Kong, whilst previous years have included California and Miami.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The company has evolved around a few core principles: quality over quantity, under-promise and over-deliver, and taking pride in your work. We take on projects that will present new problems for us to solve, and get excited about elegant solutions to complex challenges. Most importantly, we want to invest in our team - we encourage continuous learning and development and aim for a high degree of code-review as part of the day-to-day experience.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>About you</b></div><div>We are seeking a mid-level back-end developer (Rails) with exceptional attention to detail as well as being comfortable leading a software team for a given project.

If such are unavailable, we can give you a short coding exercise. If you provide an example design document or README (or even an email) demonstrating thought and communication that's helpful too. So drop us a line and tell us about yourself!</p><p>We have curated a brief set of questions to help get to know you. We hope it’s an opportunity to share what you care most about and to share your unique experiences and accomplishments. This is not an assessment, so there are no right or wrong answers.

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of the development team building our content management system(CMS) that powers our mobile and web applications. &nbsp;You will get to come to work everyday knowing you are helping educate millions of people all around the world.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned JavaScript developer and have a solid knowledge of modern JS frameworks.</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Vue.js, Postgres, Heroku and Rails.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and PTO.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p><p>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a web app, node package or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p><p><strong>Life at HLT</strong></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Remote working</li><li>Flexible hours</li><li>Large amounts of autonomy</li><li>Great pay, insurance, benefits</li></ul><p><strong>So Why HLT?</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in</p><ul><li>Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks</li><li>Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education</li><li>A fast paced and fun work environment</li><li>A career with a higher purpose</li></ul><p>Then we we would love to talk to you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/196220?reset=False&amp;ra=13NYEKqt7OyA&amp;oqs=a%3D13NYEKqt7OyA' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large amounts of autonomy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great pay, insurance, benfits</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

    "content": "This is a unique opportunity to become an influential member of a small engineering team located in Shepherd's Bush in West London. You will enjoy all of the benefits of working in a startup, the freedom to innovate, to explore new technologies and to use your experience and ideas to directly influence the business.<br /><br />*---- Why ClickMechanic ----*<br /><br />ClickMechanic is a marketplace for vehicle repairs. Our platform enables customers to acquire real-time industry-standard quotes for repairs (a first in Europe), services and diagnostics, and quickly book a vetted mechanic online. Our mission is to bring trust and transparency to car repair.<br /><br />Founded in 2012, the company has grown quickly to offer nationwide coverage and is backed by such institutional investors as 500 Startups and Forward Partners, and angel investors including the former CEO of JustEat and Chairman of Treatwell.<br /><br />Vehicle repair is a huge market, ripe for technology disruption. There are millions of consumers, tera- or even peta-bytes of potentially underused data, with an exceptional logistics infrastructure (parts distribution).<br /><br />*---- The Role ----*<br /><br />As a full-stack developer in a small team, you will work across all aspects of the product from architecture and DevOps to code reviews and tech support. Working alongside our CTO & Head of Engineering, you will deliver new features and continually improve our existing code.<br /><br />Technology underpins our entire business. We’ve built an industry-leading quote engine and mobile Mechanic App. We consume millions of rows of third-party automotive data and have implemented machine learning to improve the accuracy of our quotes.<br /><br />*---- Responsibilities ----*<br /><br />* Writing well-tested production code in Ruby and JavaScript.<br />* Refactoring and rearchitecting legacy code where appropriate to ensure you always leave it better than you found it.<br />* Reviewing code fairly and honestly; and receiving code reviews openly on each of your pull requests.<br />* Collaboration with business stakeholders to develop requirements and expectations.<br />* Collaboration with technical stakeholders to discuss constraints and opportunities.<br />* Monitoring our production systems and providing technical support to the business.<br />* Maintaining our development pipeline and toolchain.<br />* Innovation and self-led learning.<br /><br />*---- Our Technology ----*<br /><br />As a startup, we prefer open-source technologies. Our main app is built with Ruby (on Rails) and is hosted on Heroku and AWS. We use both PostgreSQL and SQL Server relational databases and also MongoDB and Elasticsearch NoSQL databases.<br /><br />Our mobile Mechanic App is built on JQuery mobile and we are planning to rearchitect this system onto a more modern framework (e.g. React) soon.<br /><br />Our development pipeline utilises Jira, Git, GitHub, Docker, Webpack, Grunt and CircleCI.<br /><br />*---- Requirements ----*<br /><br />Your potential is much more important to us than a list of characteristics. Nevertheless, here is a list of characteristics that we hope already apply to you, or that you’re very keen to develop:<br />* You consider yourself fairly expert in at least one OO programming language (not necessarily Ruby).<br />* You have built a production web application using an MVC (or equivalent) framework (e.g. Ruby on Rails).<br />* The terms OOP, SOLID and TDD make you feel warm inside.<br />* You can write complicated SQL statements directly in the console without a query designer.<br />* Unix, Linux, Heroku, GitHub and NoSQL are not just made-up words to you.<br />* You can describe JavaScript as a functional, prototypal language and know what that means.<br />* You have strong Git-fu and can perform interactive rebases from the command line.<br />* You’re not afraid to get stuck into DevOps and have a go at, say, implementing Docker in a CI pipeline.<br />* You write your best code when pair-programming with another developer regardless of their experience.<br />* You wouldn't write a line of production code without writing a failing test first, because that’s how it’s done, right?<br />* You read about programming and technology because it’s a passion, not just a profession.<br />* You see legacy code as an exciting opportunity to innovate and make things better.<br /><br />*---- Benefits ----*<br /><br />* Working with leading open-source technologies in an agile team.<br />* A culture that embraces flexibility, and rewards growth and innovation.<br />* The opportunity to directly contribute to the success of the business every day.<br />* A competitive package including company pension and share options.<br />* MacBook Pro as standard.<br />* 10% innovation time.<br />* Manage your own training budget.<br />* Tea, coffee, fruit, snacks and Friday beers provided!<br />* Bringing trust and transparency to an industry which is widely recognised for high levels customer dissatisfaction."

Some examples of the work you'll be doing include the following:<br><br>* Working closely with product and design to define and implement new features<br>* Continually improving our fetching code, which grabs data on millions of properties throughout each day<br>* Integrating various APIs to give our customers even more info about homes<br>* Making our website a more delightful experience<br><br>You'll have both the opportunity and the independence to tackle all kinds of challenges: some days you'll work on refactoring a legacy part of the app to make it do something new, and on others, you'll build a brand new, greenfield feature.<br><br>You<br><br>* You have experience architecting, building, and maintaining reliable web applications that serve hundreds of requests per second.<br>* You care about maintaining a clean, readable, well tested codebase.<br>* We work extensively with Ruby, Rails, Postgres, React, and Sass. You have experience with most of these technologies, and are eager to learn new ones.<br>* You communicate well and collaborate with the whole team, be it to clarify product specifications or work through tough code problems.<br>* You enjoy mentoring fellow team members in areas where you have expertise – and graciously accept mentorship in areas where you have an opportunity to grow.<br><br>About Us:<br><br>* We're a small team focused on opening up the old school real estate world.<br>* Our goal is to build the best place for people to browse, shop for, and buy homes.<br>* We employ an iterative approach to building products and deploy multiple times a day.<br>* We have a big vision.<br>* We believe in hiring smart people and giving them the support and flexibility to succeed.<br><br>If you work locally, you'll be in a relaxed and fun office in the Belltown neighborhood.<br>We're looking to hire the best people wherever they are in the world. If you don't want to relocate to beautiful Seattle, you should be awesome at working from home and available to join our daily standup at 9:30am Pacific Time. Some developers live in Seattle and come into the Estately office, while others live and work remotely, including from outside of the United States.&nbsp;We've had remote developers since 2011, and are seasoned veterans of working with a distributed team, across multiple time zones.<br><br>Our Hiring Process<br><br>We believe in collaborative interviews where we work with you to solve realistic problems. We interview for practical skills in a one-on-one setting, and strive to use your preferred editor and tools whenever possible. Great candidates don’t usually write code on white boards, or implement basic data structures from scratch, so we won’t ask you to do that. We want our recruiting process to be transparent to you. It roughly consists of the following steps:<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An initial call between you and a member of our team<br><br>We'll tell you more about the work that you'd be doing, and why we think Estately is a great place to work. You'll have the opportunity to ask us lots of questions, too. We'll ask you about your experience and some technical questions, mostly to get a feel for where you're at as we move forward with the process.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Individual Exercise<br><br>We have a few practical challenges to assess technical knowledge. Over the course of a few hours, you'll be fixing a bug in our app (that we've previously fixed), so we can see how you approach solving a realistic problem.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pairing on a Few Potential Features<br><br>During the pairing exercises you'll pair with one of our developers to implement an (existing) feature in the app. This will take a couple hours or so, and will mostly consist of discussion about approach, with some coding in the midst of it.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Discussion with representatives from our Product and Design teams<br><br>As a small team, all of our developers work very closely with product and design. These short sessions will give you a chance to meet and speak with the product and design folks that you would be working with on a regular basis.<br><br>Diversity<br><br>Estately seeks to increase the ratio of women and underrepresented minorities in software engineering and development, we encourage women and people from underrepresented groups to apply for this position.&nbsp;<br><br>Estately is striving to be a diverse team, made of and built by people with different backgrounds and lifestyles.

Industrialisation has brought to our shelves mass-produced, mass-distributed products and mass-marketed brands.</p><p>Unfortunately for small wine producers, they can only craft by hand a small batch each time and thanks to the three-tier system, distribution happens at very low margins and sometimes even at a loss.</p><p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_system_(alcohol_distribution)' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_system_(alcohol_distribution)</a></p><p>Most wineries in the world (circa 80%) are small mum-and-dad businesses. Passionate about crafting a piece of art. Most are not business savvy. Most are not tech savvy. Most struggle with simply emailing those who love their product, and love their story. </p><p>Yet, to survive, they need more people who care about them, to talk about them. Direct sales is key to their survival.</p><p>This total disaster extends to every wine lover. The best wine stories ever encountered can hardly be brought home or shared with those we care most about.</p><p>That's wineries and microbreweries alike.</p><p>---</p><p>At Troly, we are slowly rebalancing the industry. By connecting wineries together, our project builds the volume and leverages our collective power to help each winery into their direct sale journey. Think of it as Fair Trade Wines!</p><p>We do not have fancy swanky offices (many work from home!) We have an intimate interest in ensuring each winery and microbrewery stands the test of time. We work very closely with wineries, on a first name basis, to educate them, and show them the tools they can leverage to make their journey easier. </p><p>It will be written in history that Troly.io changed the industry. Watch this space.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to Troly.io</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Troly.io</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>You can help!</p><p>Troly is always looking for talented individuals. While there are a few boxes to check, we are far most interested by your abilities, your aptitudes and your attitude.</p><p>As a Full-Stack developer, you will be required to </p><p>→ Assist Customer Success teammates with investigations and liaise with customers to figure things out<br>→ Contribute new features as requested by customers and in-line with our strategy<br>→ Make architectural decisions, improve on internal practices and accept nothing less than quality<br>→ Contribute to architectural documentation and sustainable communications<br>→ Have an opinion on reds vs white wines</p><p>Same as any other roles at Troly;</p><p>The appeal of working for &quot;a startup&quot; or in &quot;the industry&quot; just for the sake of it, is unlikely to get you anywhere this time around. We are at a stage where our interest lies in finding founding team members. We will happily expose you to strategy, planning and the entire foundation of the business if and when required.</p><p>The right person is not afraid to shake things up or speak up when needed. They will stand their ground when they know they are right, and learn from it when they are wrong. </p><p>Technical skills are important, but making sure everyone in the team gets along is even more. We work in a distributed environment, so working alone, using technology for discussions and managing your own time are added challenges you will have to deal with.</p><p>Now, we also realise that these kind of people don’t just turn up out of the blue. So we are always on the lookout and are planning to grow based on people, not hire based on growth. In return, you must be committed, and anything measured in months will be considered insufficient.</p><p>Finally; if your only goal in life is to make a difference and genuinely help wineries, you really should get in touch. Otherwise, if this sounds like a means to an end, you can simply head over here: <a href='https://w.troly.io/u3is8' rel='nofollow'>https://w.troly.io/u3is8</a></p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>RESTful Services, Git, Wine, Heroku, Mvc, HTML5 &amp; CSS3, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, Craft Beer</div><div>Compensation</div><div>$50K–$80K<br>0.25%–2.0%</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Troly.io</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/car-next-door/jobs/333056-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/car-next-door/jobs/333056-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front-End Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/car-next-door/jobs/333056-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Car Next Door</a></div><div>Sydney, Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/wildcard-4/jobs/225363-rails-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/wildcard-4/jobs/225363-rails-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Rails Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/wildcard-4/jobs/225363-rails-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Wildcard</a></div><div>Sydney</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/townske/jobs/43498-full-stack-web-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/townske/jobs/43498-full-stack-web-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Full Stack Web Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/townske/jobs/43498-full-stack-web-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Townske.com</a></div><div>Sydney</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/metigy/jobs/341431-junior-full-stack-web-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/metigy/jobs/341431-junior-full-stack-web-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Junior Full-Stack Web Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/metigy/jobs/341431-junior-full-stack-web-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Metigy</a></div><div>Sydney</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/highseek-neuronet-1/jobs/321195-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/highseek-neuronet-1/jobs/321195-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Software engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/highseek-neuronet-1/jobs/321195-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>HighSeek neuronet</a></div><div>Russia</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/jarvis-16/jobs/305581-cto-lead-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/jarvis-16/jobs/305581-cto-lead-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>CTO / Lead Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/jarvis-16/jobs/305581-cto-lead-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Jarvis</a></div><div>Melbourne, Sydney</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/troly/jobs/215110-customer-success-and-variations-thereof?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/troly/jobs/215110-customer-success-and-variations-thereof?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Customer Success and variations ...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/troly/jobs/215110-customer-success-and-variations-thereof?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Troly.io</a></div><div>Sydney</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/284977-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/284977-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Software Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/284977-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Gitcoin</a></div><div>Boulder</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/smartxpo/jobs/346957-customer-success-leader?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/smartxpo/jobs/346957-customer-success-leader?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Customer Success Leader</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/smartxpo/jobs/346957-customer-success-leader?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>SmartXpo</a></div><div>London</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>What We're Building</h3></div><div><div><p>Troly means supercharged direct-sales for wineries and micro-breweries.</p><p>We facilitate and keep track of all sales, club activities and promotional membership efforts, for each customer and club member.

SOAP is (unfortunately) used by many operator APIs, which is why we released our open source library, <a href='https://github.com/loco2/lolsoap' rel='nofollow'>LolSoap</a>.</p><p>Some of the most difficult challenges we face relate to routing and making sense of lots of data. Which routes are best to get from A to B? Which booking systems should be queried? How might we cache data without affecting accuracy of results?</p><p>We’ve recently released mobile applications for iOS and Android. Further developing our mobile strategy is a key goal for the business.</p><p>Because Loco2 is the merchant of record for all transactions we are also responsible for fraud prevention, and handling currency and other finance-related issues.</p><p>We frequently release new features that drive rapid organic growth, and so it’s vital that we anticipate and address scaling challenges before they occur.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>An ideal candidate:</p><ul><li>Has 4+ years of professional programming experience</li><li>Has deep knowledge and experience of Ruby</li><li>Is fluent in English and confident communicating and sharing complex information and learnings with both technical and non-technical team members</li><li>Has a good working knowledge of modern devops technologies such as Docker</li><li>Is comfortable designing object oriented software from scratch, not just implementing CRUD Rails apps; a pragmatist who can see the trade-offs involved in the different approaches to solving a problem</li><li>Strives to discover and understand the root cause of problems, suggesting new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms</li><li>Actively considers future maintainability when deciding how to implement something</li><li>Has a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed</li><li>Enjoys getting their teeth stuck into complicated problems, as well as being willing to pitch in on some of the more routine tasks which inevitably arise</li><li>Is willing to participate in an on-call rota to cover technical emergencies out of hours</li><li>Can work hours that have some overlap with London daytime</li><li>Is motivated by Loco2's mission</li></ul>"

    "content": "<h3>Intro about the Role</h3><p>As a Full Stack Developer at Territory, you’ll be faced with interesting problems:  </p><ul><li>Our core system is a double-sided market, matching customer perferences in food with available inventory from chefs. There's a lot we can do to improve this, by giving our customers access to features on mobile that were previously only accessible on desktop. </li><li>We're not purely software - there's tons of logistics in our business. From curating menus to delivering food to helping our gym partners, we solve problems that cross from the digital into the physical every day.</li></ul><h3>About Territory</h3><p>We’re a platform for the next generation of wellness, focused on the hardest problem -- personalized nutrition. We sell fresh food for Food Tribes (representing 39% of the U.S. population, including whole30, gluten-free, paleo, ketogenic, vegan, and vegetarian). We're direct-to-consumer ecommerce with differentiated distribution, partnering with leading Fitness Tribes as local pickup spots (including yoga, cycling and CrossFit studios as well as boutique and high-end health clubs).  </p><p>We lead with purpose and intention, just like our customers. We’re operating in four markets (DC, DFW, SoCal and the Bay Area). In each, we work with amazing chefs using responsibly-sourced ingredients to create healthy meals that our customers rely on to undergird their health &amp; wellness goals.</p><p>Similar to other leading ecommerce companies, we’ve had to rethink the supply chain and distribution to get the highest-quality products to our customers at a reasonable price point.</p><h3>Your Responsibilities</h3><ul><li>You'll help shape and guide our core systems, tech, and software as the business matures. </li><li>You'll be a critical part of a cross-functional team, working closely with a product manager and people from many functional groups in the company. </li><li>You'll write code. But only as much as you need to build/improve features that solve problems. </li><li>You'll work with a product manager to plan the quarterly roadmap to make things better. </li><li>You'll respond to escalated CS issues, helping find out what went wrong, how to fix, and how we can do better next time. </li><li>You'll write well-tested code, and take ownership for the features your ship into the ether. </li></ul><h3>Your Mindset &amp; Experience</h3><p>At the root of it, you’re a smart, thoughtful strategic leader looking for levers of success for the business. You want to be part of a high-growth enterprise that’s trying to make a significant difference in the world where you can play a key role.  </p><h3>Education, Experience and Skills:</h3><ul><li>You're comfortable with Ruby&nbsp;and Rails; most of our codebase is here today. </li><li>You're familiar with client-side tech, enough to collaborate on designing the best way forward with front-end devs and designers. We use a lot of ReactJS&nbsp;around here. </li><li>Heroku: You should know how to deploy + maintain apps; when to scale resources (workers + add-ons). </li><li>Continuous integration: GitHub branching/PRs, automated testing, Semaphore CI, whatever it takes to ship often, reliably, and confidently. We use a combo of Rspec, Capybara, and Teaspoon/Jasmine for testing. </li><li>You’ve made decisions about a technical approach&nbsp;and seen how your ideas play out after building it out and living with it. Remote work is second-nature&nbsp;to you. </li><li>You’re aware of your time, of working to your rhythm, of taking breaks when you need them, of over-communicating and the importance of facetime, and of the dozens of other challenges that remote work brings… but you appreciate the freedom and responsibility remote work grants.</li></ul><h3>Position Logistics</h3><p>Ideally, this is a full time remote role. Once hired, we’d want to arrange for a period of in-person on-boarding.</p><h3>Our Environment</h3><p>We're a mission-driven bunch - motivated to both make great eating crazy simple, delicious and life-changing, as well as the whole stew of related goodness: food, fitness, people, passion, relationships, change, health, daring, and mirth.</p><p>We try to reflect that mission in how we work: </p><ul><li>We have active fun consistent with the work that we do including occasional &quot;recess&quot; activities: stand up paddleboarding, waterfall climbing, sand volleyball, bike rides, sailing and tree-top ropes courses.&nbsp; </li><li>Our main office is a converted house in Alexandria's Del Ray neighborhood; at the same time we're a distributed remote team by nature with team members all over the world. We live on Slack. </li><li>We're all about creating a culture of individuals that hold themselves to a very high standard and get great satisfaction from doing excellent work. We offer competitive compensation &amp; benefits including health, dental &amp; vision insurance and 401k. Benefits also include food and fitness reimbursement. </li><li>We believe at our core that the most important thing for anyone is to do challenging work that you're naturally drawn to with a team you dig in order to make a meaningful difference in the world.</li></ul><h3>To Apply</h3><p>To throw your hat into the ring, please email <a href='mailto:developer@territoryfoods.com' rel='nofollow'>developer@territoryfoods.com</a>: </p><ul><li>work you're proud of, </li><li>a super basic resume, </li><li>and a few words about why Territory sounds like an exciting place for you. &nbsp;</li></ul>"
