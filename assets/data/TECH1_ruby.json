Our culture is friendly and fast paced – we are constantly challenging, testing and adapting the way we do things. We’re also really committed to working with integrity, doing the right thing and building a company we are truly proud of.

If you’re brilliant AND humble, you’ll fit right in.</p><p>We’re continuously improving our product, building key features that will move the needle in a big way. Instead of an endless product roadmap, we run short development cycles to test assumptions and make smart decisions quickly. We favour feature flags over staging environments and deploy to production as often as we need to; deployment cycles shouldn’t get in the way of delivering value.

We&rsquo;re a small team of 2 - a designer and a business/product/many-hats person - and a few contractors.</p><br /><p>Our goal is to build a pleasant work environment and a sustainable business. We are not looking to raise external funding for at least the next couple of years.</p><br /><p>Our focus right now is on Pixie (<a href='https://www.usepixie.com/'>https://www.usepixie.com</a>), a Basecamp-style SaaS for accountancy firms. We see a path to expand to other professional services down the line, like legal, etc. but currently this is the market segment we can understand better. Pixie&rsquo;s just launched and off to a great start, feedback is positive and encouraging.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re looking to bring in someone to work together with us (not for us) and lead the software engineering side.</p><br /><p>This is a hands-on, software engineering, with salary up to &pound;40,000-&pound;45,000p.a. which we are looking to increase in the first year as the business grows. We are also offering an equity stake. As part of the founding team, you&rsquo;ll have shared control of our products and roadmaps, get a direct line to customers, and exposure to as many aspects of the business as you want. And as we grow, we hope to work together in building a small engineering team around you.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><h1>About you</h1><br /><p>We need you to have demonstrable experience with these technologies:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Ruby on Rails 5, Omniauth + Devise, RSpec, Capybara, Apartment</li><br /><li>AWS infrastructure: EC2, IAM, RDS, S3, Elasticache, etc.</li><br /><li>PostgreSQL 10+, Redis</li><br /><li>Git, Gitlab (optional)</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>It'd be brilliant if you already have some Vue.js experience, but if you've done things in React that's just as well.</p><br /><p>On the non-technical side, you feel comfortable with the idea of working on a distributed team, being self-driven and asking questions.</p><br /><p>Ideally you have some interest in owning a small software company, but our main ask is for agreement towards our values:&nbsp;<a href='https://medium.com/pomarhq/pomars-guiding-principles-ca00356174ce'>https://medium.com/pomarhq/pomars-guiding-principles-ca00356174ce</a>.</p>",

They will send you 3 different coding exercises to walk through different areas of the stack. The first coding exercise will be client-side, the second will be backend and the third will be a few SQL operations. &nbsp;They will spend 30 minutes live on each exercise with you. For any work you two decide should be finished up after that 30 minutes, you’ll have the opportunity to complete it on your own time and send it back to them. &nbsp;We’d like you to approach this meeting as if you’re mentoring our Software Developer. We encourage you to explain your approach, be collaborative and ask questions. The goal of taking you through different parts of the stack is to confirm your areas of strength and passion. We also like to see fluency with your chosen tools. &nbsp;It’s totally expected for you to use search engines while you’re problem-solving, we just ask that you’re mindful of how much you’re relying on them. &nbsp;You'll be working through the exercises on your own machine, using the tools of your choice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Code day with one of our development hiring teams&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* Our code day is meant to be a day in the life of our Software Developer role. &nbsp;You’ll join us for the day, work with our team and build an application. &nbsp;You’ll simulate a mini sprint by planning a project with a Software Developer, Database Administrator, Product Manager and Engineering Manager. &nbsp;You’ll have a combination of individual work time and pair programming with a Software Developer. &nbsp;At the end of the day, you’ll demo your application and dig into the code. &nbsp;You’ll have tons of opportunities to ask us questions and really learn what it’d be like to work at CoverMyMeds. &nbsp;We’re happy to conduct this step virtually for our remote candidates to get a good sense for how a remote Software Developer role would feel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA quick note: If you’d prefer different logistics to accommodate your individual needs and set you up for success, let us know how we can help. &nbsp;We want this process to be accessible and inclusive for you.  </div> </div>",

You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world and provide skills that will enhance our business intelligence system to help us make better decisions.\\n\\nWe’ll teach you the ins and outs of the online business brokerage industry, coming from years of experience. You’ll work on improving the customer journey, which should be flawless, pain free and easy to navigate. For many of our customers it is the first time either buying or selling an online business, which can be an incredibly anxious and confusing moment in their lives. You’ll be helping them directly by providing them with an easy to use interface that just makes sense.\\nThe Senior Full Stack Engineer position is vital to the success of our company, partnering with all departments to align technology strategy with the company’s objectives.\\n\\nOur small and close knit engineering team currently consists of a UX specialist, 2 frontend engineers, one backend engineer, one WordPress engineer and several QA specialists. You’ll work closely with the team to implement solutions for all departments within Empire Flippers, be it compliance, customer support, sales and migrations. Additional responsibilities could lead to supervising our engineering team.\\n\\nThis is a full time position – our company is growing at a fast rate, which means excellent opportunities for personal and career growth. We may ask you to attend conferences too, which can help you network with industry leaders.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n You’ll take on the challenge of improving the overall efficiency of Empire Flippers by developing fully fledged platforms, ensuring both the user experience and functionality are elevated to unprecedented levels. You’ll be responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment building high quality, architecturally sound systems. You will use your initiative to design and implement client-side and server-side architecture, as well as implement API’s and integrations that address our business needs. Both our clients and staff will be using the software you write and you’ll be responsible for monitoring system performance and configuring new software and hardware. \\n\\n# Requirements\\nYou must have a passion for travel, ideally with long periods of digital nomad experience with travel outside your home country.\\n\\nYou should have at least 5 good years of full stack experience under your belt, having implemented some complex, data driven applications. Your portfolio speaks louder than your words.\\n\\nYou should have team-lead or management experience with a remote team.\\n\\nAn in-depth understanding of database management systems, both relational and non-relational databases.\\n\\nHands on experience in IT, computer systems engineering, or systems engineering and analysis is necessary.\\n\\nYou should have an ability to conduct technological analyses and research, with a solid understanding of technological trends to build strategy.\\n\\nYou should be a ninja with every component of our tech stack. You must have a complete working knowledge of Ruby on Rails, SQL, Postgres, Sidekiq, Rspec, Git, Redis.\\n\\nExperience working with a wide range of 3rd party integrations. Our platform talks to many 3rd party applications, you should have experience building and maintaining such integrations in a test driven fashion.\\n\\nDev-ops/sysadmin skills, particularly AWS. Experience with managing servers, maintaining hosting environments, being responsible for uptime and responsiveness, addressing bottlenecks, ensuring backups are kept safe and sound.\\n\\nYou need to have immaculate attention to detail. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if something doesn’t quite look or feel right, to the nearest code change and to the nearest hexadecimal color, to the point you become annoying to us. At times other developers may edit your code, you’ll be watching to ensure the code base remains readable, scalable and fast.\\n\\nBe a good communicator. It sounds very cliché, but you’ll immerse yourself in almost every department, you’ll be learning problems and presenting solutions, and also overseeing the implementation of those solutions too.\\n\\nA self-starter. We need to see some evidence that you’re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you’ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won’t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day to day basis, you’ll be working in almost full autonomy, we’ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. We don’t believe in micro-management.\\n\\nA complete working knowledge in React. Our client code is written in React. Being able to navigate the front-end code and patch things up is needed.\\n\\nThe following skills/experience would be a bonus, but not required:\\n\\nPHP/WordPress. We will be interfacing with WordPress significantly, being able to speak the same language would be great.\\n\\nDatabases. A comprehensive experience working with various types of SQL and noSQL databases would be very useful. MySQL, Postgres, DynamoDB, Cassandra, to name a few.\\n\\nCaching. The software we’re building needs to be fast and to remain fast as we scale, both in terms of traffic and database size. Having experience with Memcached, Varnish or experience with complicated CDN setups with many rules would be a plus. \\n\\n#Salary\\n$120,000\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

    "content": "<div>Syncro is a small team crafting applications helping small business be more successful. Our software does job tracking, marketing, invoicing, integrates tons of online tools -- and is awesome. We are open to taking risks with technology, we use ember/react/kubernetes in production, and are generally open to exciting fun new stuff! We're building a company that has fun inventing. We go fast, and our customers love us. Thousands of repair shops and IT Professionals all over the world rely on our platform for their entire business operations. We are different - we really do care, the founders are writing this ad and looking at the resumes - not a recruiter or HR department. We are using heroku with 50+ dynos, our platform consists of a number of rails apps and integrations to other platforms. We hook into Google Cloud Print, we're building a huge inventory system to rival any out there, we've built a &quot;remote machine management&quot; platform with an open API, we're doing it all... If this sounds like the kind of team you want to be part of, we want to hear from you. Do you play around with new stuff for fun?Have any cool side projects to test out a new technology?Do you hear about a problem and just obsessed building a web app to solve it?If this sounds like your kind of play - we might be a great fit. :) HIGHLIGHTS: -Salaried position designed to grow with the company (seriously, try us).-We want this to be your dream job - but we need your help (tell us how).-We will advance your career like nobody else -- stay with us for the long haul and we'll keep you challenged, learning, passionate, and growing.-Results-oriented: Keep having fun and shipping code and you can design your day.-We are currently a dispersed team working from home and a few regional offices (Seattle, Bellevue, Bay Area). (WeWork - super cool space ) WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING: -Lots of building and inventing.-Helping discover and flesh out new product ideas. (Roadmap has like 1000 new features we're anxious to get to!)-Keeping us up to date with what you are learning in your spare time.-Bringing in new technology you discover that might solve a problem.-Coming up with improvements to many areas that are still sort of minimum viable state. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR: -A few years of building applications, designing interfaces, etc.-5+ years of Ruby on Rails -No specific education necessary. (really)-Excellent communication skills - verbal, written and electronic.-You care -- which means sometimes putting yourself out there for a customer experiencing pain.-Ability to multi-task in a fast paced environment.-You're kind and wily (in a good way). HOW TO GET HIRED BY US: Write us about a recent time or two that you caused a production outage, what the root cause was, and what you learned from it. For example; Troy our Founder shipped a typo in a class name a bit ago and those are annoying because they might be easily missed in Development environment but then production blows up. This led to a more robust CI+Staging step than we had prior. Just demonstrate that you are an individual, you have a personality, you enjoy life, and you enjoy good work. And please include a resume. :) SyncroMSP is an equal opportunity employer. Pay: DOE. Let's Talk.</div>",
