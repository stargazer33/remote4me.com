Every day we wake up to dozens of ecstatic messages and stories of impromptu getaways, surprise adventures and the ability to visit destinations that were prohibitively expensive.</p><p><strong>Profitable from day one. 100% bootstrapped.</strong></p><p>Our business model is simple and transparent: we offer free and premium subscriptions. Premium subscribers pay $39/year and get 100% of deals (free subscribers get ~ 1 in 3 deals), no ads in emails, and first dibs on emails. We don't get referral fees for any bookings, and our North Star is finding the best deals.</p><p>We're currently doing over $5,000,000 annual run rate. We've never taken venture capital, and instead focus on delivering as much value to subscribers as we can every day.</p><p><strong>Do the best work of your life.</strong></p><p>If your dream job is to be one of the founding members of an engineering team at a high-growth, remote company with product-market fit, we'd love to connect.</p><p>You'll work on a small (but growing!) team of developers that operate with limitless ownership, autonomy and room for growth. We value prior leadership experience, though by no means require anybody to be on a path toward management.</p><p><strong>We're a 100% remote team and wouldn't have it any other way.</strong></p><p>Unlike some remote roles, we don't have any offices, so you'll never be left out of the loop while a group of people in 'HQ' have an impromptu huddle in a conference room and make decisions while you're not there.</p><p>We rely heavily on Slack, Zoom, Google Team Drive, Geekbot asynchronous daily standups, JIRA and a few other cool tools to stay connected and in alignment.</p><p><strong>The interview process.</strong></p><p>We're a small team and move quickly. Step one is a brief&nbsp;chat with our recruiter, then a short (1-hour) coding exercise, two technical interviews (think coding kata), a brief call with our Product lead and a final round chat with our co-founders, Scott and Brian. From there we'll ask for a few references and get an offer out. Total time? Two weeks or less if we can align schedules.</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>No commute!

We believe that Americans want to vote, and will vote in higher numbers -- and more consistently -- as voting becomes more convenient. We launched in April of 2016, and have since helped 13 million Americans register to vote and cast ballots via a combination of best-in-class technology and innovative proactive outreach. Most recently, we ran the single largest nonpartisan GOTV (get out the vote) drive in Alabama history. Our work has the potential to change the outcome of elections by bringing millions more voters into the voting booth. &nbsp;<strong><br></strong><br><strong><em>Vote.org is deeply committed to diversity.

Our CEO is a loud, proud, queer woman. Our board of directors is intentionally all female -- and they're also 40% women of color. Almost half of our team members have kids, and all of the kids are under 5 years old. We love both dogs and cats, although we have slightly more cats on the team.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Short commute.</strong> We all work from home and it is just the best.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Parent friendly policies.</strong> If you need to take 3-5pm off every day to get your kids from school and make after school snacks, we're totally cool with that.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Excellent medical coverage.</strong> Full health, dental and vision for employees and generous coverage for your children.</li><li><strong>Generous time off.</strong>&nbsp; 3 weeks of&nbsp;<em>mandatory</em>&nbsp;vacation and 12 paid holidays</li><li><strong>Retirement accounts.</strong> We offer both a 401(k) and a Roth 401(k) because we want you to retire one day.</li><li><strong>Awesome slack channels.</strong> Including #music, #pets, #politics, and #OMG-WTF-LOL.</li><li><strong>Fame and fortune.</strong> Obama <a href='https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/927702713298759680' rel='nofollow'>tweeted</a>&nbsp;about us once, without any warning, the site didn't melt.

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of our Rails and API team that is responsible for building and maintaining our API that drives our mobile applications, as well as working to help us expand our rapidly growing web-app.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned Rubyist and have a solid knowledge of Rails</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Postgres, Heroku, modern JS and CSS frameworks.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and sick leave.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><br></strong>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a Ruby gem, or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/164399?reset=False&amp;ra=T8klBpFXjCE&amp;oqs=a%3DT8klBpFXjCE' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>                    <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large amounts of autonomy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great pay, insurance, benfits</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

If such are unavailable, we can give you a short coding exercise. If you provide an example design document or README (or even an email) demonstrating thought and communication that's helpful too. So drop us a line and tell us about yourself!</p><p>We have curated a brief set of questions to help get to know you. We hope it’s an opportunity to share what you care most about and to share your unique experiences and accomplishments. This is not an assessment, so there are no right or wrong answers.

For this reason, this role is only suitable for someone who likes being closely involved in product — what to build and how it will work, as much as the technical implementation itself.<br /><br />This role is especially suited to someone who wants to be part of the founding team and influence the direction of the company.<br /><br />Again, this is a hands-on role and you will be leading and managing the company’s technological vision, strategy and development. <br /><br />You will be expected to help in the preparation of presentations to the Board and lend a hand when needed to customer queries. We are a Start-up after all.<br /><br />You will have responsibility for all technical aspects and technological resources of the business including budget control and the recruitment of additional development personnel, whom you will lead. <br /><br />Previous Fintech experience is not essential but hugely helpful providing you can demonstrate why this is the best next step for you.<br /><br />We are looking for self-starter with a go-to attitude and plenty of initiative, an excellent communicator, including a proven ability to explain complex technical concepts clearly and concisely to non-technical people. Excellent problem-solving abilities are also important in the role.<br /><br />We place a high value on learning and personal growth, so you’ll have time to learn new technologies in work time and attend conferences at the company’s expense. Remote work is available but every few months we will require you to travel to HQ to spend time with the team for a few days (at the company’s expense). <br /><br /><br /><br />Responsibilities<br /><br />•    Full stack web/mobile application development<br />•    E-commerce platform plugins eg Shopify, Magento and BigCommerce<br />•    Integration into numerous banks and lenders<br />•    Development of our API<br />•    Build, deploy, maintain and support our product suite<br />•    Build report interfaces and data feeds<br /><br /><br />Our current stack<br /><br />    Front End - Fully responsive web based system using HTML5, CSS3 and Jquery <br />    Mobile - Phone: Swift (IOS), Phone: Android (Java & XML) <br />    Backend Technology - Latest Ruby on Rails <br /><br />Salary and benefits<br /><br />Let’s talk, tell us what will make you happy and we will try to accommodate.<br /><br />Salary and equity to discuss…..<br />"

We know how it is.</div><div></div><div>Which is why we’ll try to sell ourselves to you here.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><i>Ahum. Here it comes.</i></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><b>What makes the dev team at Silverfin special?</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>First of all, we build a hell of a product and our customers love us. Even our customers’ customers love us. Silverfin solves a very real problem: it automates a large chunk of the repetitive tasks that people working in financial services spend their time on, and improves communication with their customers.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>To give you a sense of scale: our database doesn’t fit on a 1TB SSD anymore*, and our largest table has 5 billion rows. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We’re a remote-first engineering team with an office in Ghent which you can visit if you’d like. Still, most of us work remotely, even those who are local. We’re based all over Europe, and without Slack we’d be lonely, now we just zap in and out of the zone as we wish. Or not: we encourage judicious use of the DnD function, and recommend async communication over disturbing synchronous pings.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We’d be really happy to welcome you in our <a href='https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23dev' rel='nofollow'><span>#dev</span></a> channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other IRL too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><b>What does working at Silverfin look like?</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We work in small focussed teams of around 5 people, each team taking ownership of a part of the application. When developing new features, the team is responsible for both the backend as well as the frontend part.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>You’ll be supported by our crazy good UI designer who writes HTML and CSS components into a reusable UI-kit, and even builds Vue prototypes where necessary, handling compatibility problems with different browsers for you, and making sure everything is responsive too.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>On the other side of the spectrum is our genius devops team who keeps things running smoothly, making sure deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our stack is Vue.js and vanilla JS with a sprinkling of jQuery on the frontend and an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend. We use PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. We use Gitlab, Basecamp, Confluence and Slack for everyday tasks and Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice. No code gets deployed without a thorough code-review by a peer, testing is a must, our sprints are called cycles and last 3 weeks, and sometimes we even finish everything that we committed to in time.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><b>What are we looking for?</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We’re looking for somebody who’s <i>really great</i> at developing in Ruby and Ruby on Rails.</div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><span></span>You need to be experienced in both Ruby <i>and</i> Rails, and also know where the boundaries lie between them. You need to be able to code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels.</li><li><span></span>You enjoy mentoring juniors and giving in-depth feedback during code reviews.</li><li><span></span>You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.</li><li><span></span>You know and apply best practices. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also good object oriented design, SRP, SOLID, ...</li><li><span></span>You’ve got opinions on code design and you can defend them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.</li><li><span></span>You have good knowledge and foresight of potential performance issues that might arise when working with large datasets.</li></ul><div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>What we offer</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><span></span>Proper work-life balance</li><li><span></span>Free to choose your own schedule and work remotely</li><li><span></span>A stimulating work environment with passionate colleagues</li><li><span></span>Team retreats twice a year</li><li><span></span>A €1000 yearly budget to visit conferences of your choice</li></ul><div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Requirements</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><span></span>You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby and have the battle scars to prove it.</li><li><span></span>You grok Rails</li><li><span></span>Your work hours overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)</li></ul><div></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Good to have</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><span></span>Some experience with Javascript (ES6) and frontend frameworks</li><li><span></span>Experience in Fintech</li><li><span></span>Accounting knowledge</li></ul><div></div><div><br></div><div>*:<i> Our devops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re indexing all the things, but it still sounds impressive, right?</i></div><div><span><i></i></span></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Interested to join our Dev team?

Today, we are one of the best known innovators in our industry working with some of the largest RPO and staffing companies in the world. </p><p>So, if you like challenges, long working hours, celebrate small wins with a focus on our larger mission and vision &quot;We are looking for you&quot;.</p><p>At Recroup, we believe the technology is as good as the people who build it. So, you don't need to be the rockstar ROR developer just yet, but if you have passion to become one learning from some of  the smartest coders &quot;We are looking for you&quot;</p><p>Though, we are looking for candidates in Canada but if you can show us why you deserve to be a part of our team we can provide Visa sponsorship for candidates from outside Canada.</p></div>"

We're now working on scaling the product and providing advanced features to aid student learning and empower teachers with more tools to help them see how to guide their students.</p><p>Why: We don’t do it just because it’s interesting (though it is). We do it because we’re obsessed with solving one of the most catastrophic, under-acknowledged problems in the US and the world: year after year, students graduate high school without being able to read at the level that is required for success in college and in life.</p><p>Where: New York, Bangalore &amp; other Indian cities.</p><p>Apply to us through AngelList:<a href='https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/134957-senior-ruby-engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/134957-senior-ruby-en...</a><a href='https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/348137-frontend-engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/348137-frontend-engin...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"
