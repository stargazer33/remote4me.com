Contact us now!</strong></div><div><br>Want to increase your chances of standing out? Include your open source contributions, blog posts and other publications you wrote, links to conference talks. You could even tell us about one thing or two you created that you are particularly proud of or the most challenging features you've worked on.&nbsp;</div><div><br>The hiring process consists of four steps:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><ol><li>A small homework: Imagine that you don't want to or just don't have enough time to go through entire Twitter timeline every day and you are only interested in URLs to the various resources that are submitted by the people you follow (e.g., to blog posts). Implement a solution that will solve this problem and will allow to specify either since when you want to fetch tweets or between what timestamps and will deliver the result via the email. Divide the solution into two Rails applications:<br><br>1.1 Service A with UI where specify the input (i.e. timestamps but also the email address, to which the results will be delivered)<br><br>1.2 Service B will accept the input somehow from Service A and deliver the result via email. The template for the email should be customizable (e.g. using Liquid) and the Service B should be flexible enough to handle potentially other use cases with different input. In that sense, delivering URLs from Twitter would be just one of the many types of emails that such service should be capable of handling. The template for this particular use case should include the URLs themselves, date and some info indicating what it is about (especially for shortened URLs). Treat it as a real-world project and send us a link to the repo.<br><br><br></li><li>Technical interview with a remote pair-programming session: the interview part shouldn't take too much time - we are mostly interested in the ability to solve the actual problems and being able to figure out the best possible solution for that problem, not in knowing things can be easily googled and learned through experience, that's why the interview part will be focused mostly on open-ended questions about some non-trivial matters. The pair-programming session will take a bit longer, and it will involve some nice challenge in a Rails universe.<br><br><br></li><li>An interview with our CEO and/or COO that will be focused more on soft things, nothing technical this time.<br><br><br></li><li>An opportunity to have the conversation with the entire team you are going to work with. It is an excellent way for both sides to make sure we will be a perfect mutual match.</li></ol></div>",

We want to earn our right to keep you every single day. \\nHey, my name is Calvin, and I know how you feel. \\nBecause... \\nEven though I am the founder of the successful online platform Simplero.com andmight I addIve been blessed with a wonderful staff of intelligent and kind people from all over the globe, things were not always like this. \\nI spent many a dark hour figuring out why being awkward in the company of other human beings made me become great at developing software. \\nPart of that is probably that being broken and alone is a good motivator for developing skills as a programmer. \\nBut for many other things in life? \\nNot so much. \\nAnyway, today Im happy to report that I enjoy the best of both sides: \\nThe light side of having mastered the art of focus and logical thinking. \\nAND... \\nHaving great relationships and being able to build a strong organization with an incredible team and massive growth potential. \\nBut alas. \\nA dark and evil power is upon us. \\nAnd this \\n...is where you enter the story. \\nYou will be the Superman who is called upon to hammer the villains back into the abyss from whence they came. \\nOops. I got carried away...I do that. \\nThe truth is, we have an amazingand shockingly smallengineering team. Im eager to add a few exceptional people who can help in our fight against evil. \\nI mean that part by the way. Jokes and corny comic book metaphors aside...what were doing is important. Were out to change the world, and we need your help. \\nSo what do you say..? \\nDo you want to play, or dont you? \\nUnder this youll find the usual features and benefits, but dont let that keep you from raising your hand if you feel a connection after reading this. \\nYour friend in the good fight, \\nCalvin Correli\\nCEO and founder of Simplero\\n\\n\\nWhats in it for you:\\n\\n * Changing lives at scale.

Welcome to the 100x club!\\n * Know how great it feels when you make a customers day. Youre not locked in a room 4 floors away from anyone who talks to a customer: youll see the impact of each bug fix, surprise and delight tweak, and feature.\\n \\n\\n\\nBenefits\\n\\n * 4 weeks of mandatory vacation per year. We cant force you to have a good time, but please, please shut off Basecamp.\\n * Access to hundreds of hours of training material, books, workouts, etc.. For just about anything you want to learn about Internet business, personal growth, software developmentif its not already in our virtual library, just ask.\\n * Personal and professional coaching.

We do it because we love it today, not because we hope to make out like bandits in the future.\\n * We're profitable and have been in business for 10 years.

You will be joining a smart and passionate team who have worked on a number of projects over the last few years, that cares about diversity and shared reward, and who are passionate about our work.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /><div><strong>About The Role</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /><div>We are looking for a Ruby on Rails developer who is excited at the idea of building systems and user-interfaces that will be at the core of our company. You might be fresh out of university and looking for your first challenge, or have been a developer for decades and looking for somewhere to apply your knowledge and experience. It is important that you are comfortable building Ruby on Rails applications.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /><div>The role is remote. We are ideally looking for someone in the UK or Europe, to rapidly respond to EU client needs if necessary. The current team is based in a mixture of London, Scotland, and the Phillipines. We meet in person sporadically but have daily conversation online through a mixture of video calls and Slack.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /><div><strong>Personality Fit</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /><div>Different jobs fit different people. Our most important focus with anyone joining our team is that they will enjoy working with us that we will enjoy working with them. This is a good starting place to see if that might be you:</div><br /><ul><br /><li>We think your gender, race and sexuality are your business and irrelevant to how good you are at your job. It&rsquo;s important to us that you feel the same way about others.</li><br /><li>We care about our work and what we do is an important part of our lives. It matters to us and it matters that you feel the same.</li><br /><li>We seek truth in our conversations. We each care about reaching the right conclusion and learning, not worrying about who came up with the idea. That means we respectfully challenge each others suggestions and are willing to have our ideas challenged. If you can detach yourself from your opinions and be open to being wrong (as well as right!) then you&rsquo;ll enjoy solving problems with us.</li><br /><li>We&rsquo;re a remote team of individuals with our own personal working habits and routines. Some days we focus on working by ourselves, and some days are spent chatting and brainstorming for hours. That means that both self-discipline and teamwork are crucial skills to us. Previous experience of working remotely in this way would be very valuable.</li><br /><li>We are a very autonomous team. We agree requirements and timescales as a group then go and execute, trusting everyone else in the team will do the same. It's therefore critical that everyone on the team is reliable, self-motivated and strive to meet the targets they commit to.</li><br /><li>We value grit and tenacity, doggedly attacking problems until we solve them. That grit is fueled by a passion for our work and the determination to do a good job. It's important to us that you have the same committed attitude to finishing what you start.</li><br /><li>Everyone in our team actively wants to learn and develop, both professionally and personally. We support and help each other in whatever challenges we are attacking and develop and grow together. If that sounds fun to you, then you&rsquo;ll fit in well.</li><br /></ul><br /><div><br /><strong>Our Stack and Technology</strong></div><br /><ul><br /><li>Multiple systems built using Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Turbolinks, and JQuery.</li><br /><li>Search and recommendations backed by ElasticSearch.</li><br /><li>Systems communicate via HTTP APIs and thousands of messages per hour via Amazon SQS and SNS.</li><br /><li>A data pipeline processes analytics for millions of page and video views per day.</li><br /><li>A video processing pipeline which can scale to thousands of videos uploaded per hour.</li><br /></ul><br /><div><br /><strong>Skills Fit</strong><br /><br />Things which matter to us:</div><br /><ul><br /><li>You are intelligent and passionate about technology.</li><br /><li>You enjoy making websites and want to learn and develop your skills.</li><br /><li>You are comfortable making websites with Ruby on Rails, not only working on models and controllers, but implementing and adjusting CSS and HTML.</li><br /><li>You have some experience with Javascript libraries.</li><br /><li>You understand and value programmatic testing.</li><br /><li>You are open to making pragmatic decisions, not seeking the &quot;perfect&quot; solution but understanding that everything has tradeoffs.</li><br /></ul><br /><div>&nbsp;</div><br /><div>Things which don't matter to us:</div><br /><ul><br /><li>Formal qualifications - if you&rsquo;ve got skills, that&rsquo;s all that matters to us.</li><br /><li>Professional experience - if you have a proven professional track record, that great, but we're equally happy to hire someone who has been coding as a hobby for a while and honed their skills outside of their main job.</li><br /><li>Your Github profile - if you have commits to open-source projects then we&rsquo;d love to see them, but that&rsquo;s not a prerequisite. We&rsquo;re much more interested in knowing what you&rsquo;ve done and hear your stories.</li><br /></ul><br /><div><br /><strong>Your Package</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /></div><br /><div>Your renumeration should be about more than money. This is what we offer:</div><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Salary:</strong>&nbsp;Salary is dependant on what you bring to the role and will depend on the individual candidate. We anticipate a range of between &pound;25k and &pound;40k.</li><br /><li><strong>Equity:</strong>&nbsp;You will also receive share options in Reachora, which hopefully will prove significantly more lucrative for you in the long-run! The exact amount will depend on what you bring to the role. Share options are normally vested over three years with a one year cliff.</li><br /><li><strong>Culture:</strong>&nbsp;We're commited to building that team that respects each other. We'll take any problems you have seriously and we'll strive to make sure that Reachora is a great place for you to work.</li><br /><li><strong>Technology:</strong>&nbsp;We'll give you a shiny new Macbook for you to enjoy creating on.</li><br /><li><strong>Holiday:</strong>&nbsp;Our team has a flexible holiday allowance. We believe rest and variety are crucial for a healthy, creative mind and so insist that you take at least 30 days off each year.</li><br /><li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong>&nbsp;Live and work from wherever makes you the happiest and most productive. Hobbies and family are just as important as work, and we'll always try and support you in what you do.</li><br /><li><strong>Learning:</strong>&nbsp;There's little more important than personal development. We'll support you if you want to take courses, and we'll give you an Amazon account that you order books from, free to you and hassle-free.</li><br /></ul><br /><div><br /><strong>How to Apply</strong><br /><br />Our process starts with a relevant technical coding challenge, then two rounds of video interviews: One with a senior developer on the team to chat about your skills and the job, and a second with a non-technical member of our team to assess personality and communication skills.</div><br /></div><br /><div class=&quot;listing-tools listing-tools-desktop&quot;><br /><div class=&quot;job-info&quot;><br /><div class=&quot;apply_tooltip&quot;><a id=&quot;job-cta-alt&quot; href='mailto:doug@reachora.com?body=%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%20-%20The%20We%20Work%20Remotely%20Team%20%0A%20weworkremotely.com&amp;subject=Application%20for%20Full-Stack%20Ruby%20on%20Rails%20Developer%20at%20Reachora' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>Apply for this position</a></div><br /><ul><br /><li id=&quot;sharelist-description&quot;>Share this job:</li><br /></ul><br /></div><br /></div>",

We avoid meetings and regard email as a necessary communication tool.&nbsp; The languages we use are mostly Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and CoffeeScript.&nbsp; PostgreSQL is our main data store while MS-SQL is used for customer integrations. The tools we lean on are Cucumber, Rspec, GitHub and CircleCI.&nbsp; Our migration to the Google Cloud platform is underway.</p><p>Your average day will start with checking in with the team and making sure no one has any immediate needs.&nbsp; Usually there aren't any. You'll then be able to focus on your engineering tasks. As a full stack engineer this will include direct engineering work on the product, SQL based client integrations, code reviews and DevOps related work. You will be expected to make progress in a self-directed fashion without micromanagement. At the end of each day you should feel good about your work product, the company's direction and enjoy your free time.</p><p>You need to be eligible to work in the United States.&nbsp; If you're interested please submit your resume. We will try to respond to all submissions.&nbsp; Please be aware that there is a real human on the other end of this transaction so if you spam the job listing don't be surprised if you get ignored.</p>            </div>        <div>            <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/145818?reset=False&amp;ra=MTYuMTMQJZ6&amp;oqs=a%3DMTYuMTMQJZ6%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>                                <span>Easy apply</span>            </a>                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from wherever you can be productive</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salary with 401k and profit sharing</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Two weeks of paid time off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical benefits for you</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Apple laptop provided</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Opportunity for a team meet-up at least once per year</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

    "content": "<h3>Full-Stack Ruby on Rails Developer</h3><div><div><strong>Overview<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We're looking for a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer to build and maintain the various websites and dashboards that make up Reachora. You will be joining a smart and passionate team who have worked on a number of projects over the last few years, that cares about diversity and shared reward, and who are passionate about our work.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>About The Role</strong><br><br><br></div><div>We are looking for a Ruby on Rails developer who is excited at the idea of building systems and user-interfaces that will be at the core of our company. You might be fresh out of university and looking for your first challenge, or have been a developer for decades and looking for somewhere to apply your knowledge and experience. It is important that you are comfortable building Ruby on Rails applications.<br><br><br></div><div>The role is remote. We are ideally looking for someone in the UK or Europe, to rapidly respond to EU client needs if necessary. The current team is based in a mixture of London, Scotland, and the Phillipines. We meet in person sporadically but have daily conversation online through a mixture of video calls and Slack.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Personality Fit</strong><br><br><br></div><div>Different jobs fit different people. Our most important focus with anyone joining our team is that they will enjoy working with us that we will enjoy working with them. This is a good starting place to see if that might be you:</div><ul><li>We think your gender, race and sexuality are your business and irrelevant to how good you are at your job. It’s important to us that you feel the same way about others.</li><li>We care about our work and what we do is an important part of our lives. It matters to us and it matters that you feel the same.</li><li>We seek truth in our conversations. We each care about reaching the right conclusion and learning, not worrying about who came up with the idea. That means we respectfully challenge each others suggestions and are willing to have our ideas challenged. If you can detach yourself from your opinions and be open to being wrong (as well as right!) then you’ll enjoy solving problems with us.</li><li>We’re a remote team of individuals with our own personal working habits and routines. Some days we focus on working by ourselves, and some days are spent chatting and brainstorming for hours. That means that both self-discipline and teamwork are crucial skills to us. Previous experience of working remotely in this way would be very valuable.</li><li>We are a very autonomous team. We agree requirements and timescales as a group then go and execute, trusting everyone else in the team will do the same. It's therefore critical that everyone on the team is reliable, self-motivated and strive to meet the targets they commit to.</li><li>We value grit and tenacity, doggedly attacking problems until we solve them. That grit is fueled by a passion for our work and the determination to do a good job. It's important to us that you have the same committed attitude to finishing what you start.</li><li>Everyone in our team actively wants to learn and develop, both professionally and personally. We support and help each other in whatever challenges we are attacking and develop and grow together. If that sounds fun to you, then you’ll fit in well.</li></ul><div><br><strong>Our Stack and Technology</strong></div><ul><li>Multiple systems built using Ruby on Rails, MySQL, Turbolinks, and JQuery.</li><li>Search and recommendations backed by ElasticSearch.</li><li>Systems communicate via HTTP APIs and thousands of messages per hour via Amazon SQS and SNS.</li><li>A data pipeline processes analytics for millions of page and video views per day.</li><li>A video processing pipeline which can scale to thousands of videos uploaded per hour.</li></ul><div><br><strong>Skills Fit</strong><br><br>Things which matter to us:</div><ul><li>You are intelligent and passionate about technology.</li><li>You enjoy making websites and want to learn and develop your skills.</li><li>You are comfortable making websites with Ruby on Rails, not only working on models and controllers, but implementing and adjusting CSS and HTML.</li><li>You have some experience with Javascript libraries.</li><li>You understand and value programmatic testing.</li><li>You are open to making pragmatic decisions, not seeking the &quot;perfect&quot; solution but understanding that everything has tradeoffs.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Things which don't matter to us:</div><ul><li>Formal qualifications - if you’ve got skills, that’s all that matters to us.</li><li>Professional experience - if you have a proven professional track record, that great, but we're equally happy to hire someone who has been coding as a hobby for a while and honed their skills outside of their main job.</li><li>Your Github profile - if you have commits to open-source projects then we’d love to see them, but that’s not a prerequisite. We’re much more interested in knowing what you’ve done and hear your stories.</li></ul><div><br><strong>Your Package</strong><br><br><br></div><div>Your renumeration should be about more than money. This is what we offer:</div><ul><li><strong>Salary:</strong> Salary is dependant on what you bring to the role and will depend on the individual candidate. We anticipate a range of between £25k and £40k.</li><li><strong>Equity:</strong> You will also receive share options in Reachora, which hopefully will prove significantly more lucrative for you in the long-run! The exact amount will depend on what you bring to the role. Share options are normally vested over three years with a one year cliff.</li><li><strong>Culture:</strong> We're commited to building that team that respects each other. We'll take any problems you have seriously and we'll strive to make sure that Reachora is a great place for you to work.</li><li><strong>Technology:</strong> We'll give you a shiny new Macbook for you to enjoy creating on.</li><li><strong>Holiday:</strong> Our team has a flexible holiday allowance. We believe rest and variety are crucial for a healthy, creative mind and so insist that you take at least 30 days off each year.</li><li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> Live and work from wherever makes you the happiest and most productive. Hobbies and family are just as important as work, and we'll always try and support you in what you do.</li><li><strong>Learning:</strong> There's little more important than personal development. We'll support you if you want to take courses, and we'll give you an Amazon account that you order books from, free to you and hassle-free.</li></ul><div><br><strong>How to Apply</strong><br><br><br></div><div>If you think you would enjoy working with us and would be a good fit for the role, then please get in touch by emailing <span>Doug Shearer</span>.<br><br><br></div><div>Our process starts with a relevant technical coding challenge, then two rounds of video interviews: One with a senior developer on the team to chat about your skills and the job, and a second with a non-technical member of our team to assess personality and communication skills.</div><span>Apply now</span></div>",

    "content": "<h3>Seasoned Ruby Developer</h3><div><div>If you’re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span><br><br>Ahum. Here it comes.<br><br><br><strong>What’s a Silverfin?</strong><br><br>At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimize their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.<br><br>The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every day more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 200.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.<br><br><br><strong>What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?</strong><br><br>We’re a remote-first engineering team of 25 people distributed in 14 different countries. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring in this regard, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.<br><br>Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids — whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself. You also fully decide when you take time off: our team is sufficiently varied and well organized that there are always enough people around to handle the load, and in the rare cases it’s not, we will decrease the load instead of asking people to move their holiday.<br><br>Being remote-first means we favor asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in our wiki, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!<br><br>We’d be really happy to welcome you in our #dev channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other in real life too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company so we can spend some time together with the other departments.<br><br><br><strong>What does working at Silverfin look like?</strong><br><br>We work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people.<br><br>You’ll be supported by our UI designer who develops and maintains HTML and CSS components into a reusable UI-framework, and even builds Vue.js prototypes where necessary, handling compatibility problems with different browsers for you, and making sure everything is responsive as well.<br><br>Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”.<br><br>Our stack is Vue.js and vanilla JS with a sprinkling of jQuery on the frontend and an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend. We use PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice.<br><br>No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.<br><br>Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 7TB*, and our largest table recently crossed the 10 billion row mark. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.<br><br>*<em>: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?</em><br><br><br><strong>What does your future look like?</strong><br><br>Personal growth is key to staying motivated. At Silverfin you don’t need to move to management in order to get promoted. We see the individual contributor track and the management track as two different growth paths which every engineer can follow and switch between. You can be promoted, including pay raises, as a contributor just like as a manager.<br><br>Everyone has a €1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other training to improve their skills and level up. This also includes accommodation, travel costs. If the conference is on a workday you’ll get paid like any normal day. Silverfin colleagues regularly visit conferences across the world. Are you going to Euruko this year? Come say hi!<br><br>We’re looking to hire a lot of new colleagues, and by the end of the year we’d like to have a couple of more teams. Each new team would also need a new teamlead, and we prefer to promote from within the engineering team. This means if you’d like to step onto the management track, there will be plenty of opportunities to do so in the near future. We pro-actively keep track of who would be interested, and provide feedback and learning opportunities to work towards such a goal.<br><br><br><strong>What are we looking for?</strong><br><br><br></div><ul><li>You’re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them. You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary.</li><li>You’re up for mentoring coworkers and can give in-depth, productive feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls.</li><li>You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.</li><li>You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally.</li><li>You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.</li><li>You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.</li><li>You’ve got opinions on code design and you can discuss them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.</li></ul><div><br><br><strong>What can we offer you?</strong><br><br><br></div><ul><li>Actual, proper work-life balance</li><li>Choose your own working hours and work 100% remotely</li><li>Personal growth training and opportunities</li><li>Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 25 colleagues in 14 different countries</li><li>A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues</li><li>A €1000 yearly budget for conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills</li></ul><div><br><strong>Requirements</strong><br><br><br></div><ul><li>You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in other languages.</li><li>You get Rails</li><li>Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)</li></ul><div><strong><br>Nice to have’s</strong><br><br>These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the following applies to you.<br><br><br></div><ul><li>Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team</li><li>Experience with Javascript (ES6) and frontend frameworks</li><li>Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring</li><li>Experience in Fintech</li><li>Accounting knowledge</li></ul><div><br><strong>Interested?</strong><br><br><br></div><ul><li>Read about how our interviewing process looks like (https://engineering.silverfin.com/engineering-interview-process/)&nbsp;</li><li>Apply for the job right here (https://boards.greenhouse.io/silverfin/jobs/4652474002)</li><li>Or email us with any questions on <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span></li></ul><div><br><br><br></div><span>Apply now</span></div>",

Do you have a passion for working with Product Managers to shape and deliver outstanding products for our customers?&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re Bloom &amp; Wild, the UK&rsquo;s most loved online florist. We&rsquo;re using technology to reimagine the experience of buying and receiving flowers, connecting people more thoughtfully to make sending flowers a joy to send and a delight to receive. In doing so we're aiming to become Europe&rsquo;s most loved flower brand. We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;20million in venture capital funding and were recently named as the second-fastest growing tech company in the UK by Deloitte. One of the Tech Nation &ldquo;Future Fifty&rdquo; alumni and one of the Sunday Times Top 100 Small Companies to Work For 2020, we&rsquo;re now the fastest growing online flower company in Europe.</p><br /><p>Our business has, so far, been in the fortunate position to be able to continue trading and growing during this time of economic uncertainty, with the Government actively encouraging online retail, and customer demand for flowers for their loved ones is strong due to social distancing measures in place.</p><br /><p>This is a great opportunity for a Software Engineering Manager with people management experience to lead two cross functional engineering squads. You will report to Steve, our VP Engineering who is extremely passionate about people development and scaling teams. You&rsquo;ll get to shape both people and platforms to support our ambitious growth plans and take part in the next phase of our success.</p><br /><p>In Technology we're split into three squads with a fourth on the way. You'll start by leading the Growth squad, which focuses on driving profitable customer acquisition across all of our markets.&nbsp; This means helping to inspire our customers to understand, find, compare and select their perfect gift as well as working on improvements to our core checkout flow - delightfully expressing our brand to new customers and making it easy to order flowers.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll then play a leading part in the setup and day to day running of our new Expansion squad, with a mission to accelerate growth outside our UK core business. You&rsquo;ll work closely with our VP of Business Development as the squad works on solutions that build our international markets, develop new distribution channels and support the development of new products and services.</p><br /><p><strong>About you</strong></p><br /><p>Building diverse, happy, high performing squads will be a key part of what you do.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We believe strongly in giving our squads autonomy, while using cross team communities of practice and company wide OKRs to ensure alignment. You&rsquo;ll need to be comfortable working at pace, while fostering a mindset of continuous improvement within the squad, evolving and extending the agile, iterative approach to meet the squad&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll play a leading part in delivering the product and technology roadmap, and ensuring that customer needs are at the forefront of the squad members minds. We favour a collaborative, data-driven and experimental approach to solving complex problems, and expect our Engineering Managers to foster this mindset in their squads. You&rsquo;ll ensure that there is a focus on scrum mastery within your squad, either by playing the role yourself or empowering a squad member to assist you.</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll work closely with other Engineering Managers, VP Engineering and community of practice leads to shape the technology roadmap and strategy going forwards, ensuring that we are improving the whole team and optimising the approach for more than just your squad.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Ideally your background will be in frontend development and this will enable you to help your squad interpret requirements into something they can deliver as you work with them to find the right technical approach. Working with our VP Engineering and Technology Leadership team, you&rsquo;ll help to solve our top priority problems for the quarter from a technology and people perspective.</p><br /><p>As an experienced people manager you&rsquo;ll take responsibility for performance management, career progression, pastoral care and everything else that means that you have a happy and motivated squad. The team environment that you create will promote both autonomy and accountability. You&rsquo;ll be a great coach and servant leader, able to motivate and guide the squad through the good times and the bad, learning and improving as you go.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We care about creating a diverse and inclusive team - it's what helps us generate the best ideas and grow faster. We want to make giving and receiving gifts a joy for everyone, and to do this we need people from all backgrounds, with different perspectives and ideas. We welcome anyone to apply, with the knowledge that you&rsquo;ll have the freedom to give your opinion, do your best work and be part of a genuinely inclusive, friendly and caring team.</p><br /><p><strong>Our tech</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll also get to work with some great technology. Our stack consists of iOS and Android apps, an Angular 7 website and backend platform in Ruby on Rails. We encourage our developers to be full stack and our squads to own their code from their local machine into usage in production. We&rsquo;re focusing heavily on increasing our usage of machine learning and automation of our business processes so we can continue to scale at pace.

Join a team that's redefining what product management systems can be.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><strong>Our Tech Stack</strong></strong></p><p>productboard's stack is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>&nbsp;backend built by passionate Rubyists with&nbsp;<strong>React.js&nbsp;</strong>on<strong>&nbsp;Typescript&nbsp;</strong>on the frontend. Over time with demand, we've added new technologies to support the growing needs of the team, both in complexity and traffic. We're running&nbsp;<strong>Elasticsearch</strong>&nbsp;to power our Insights search, we are fully migrated to&nbsp;<strong>Kubernetes</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>AWS</strong>&nbsp;to enable an event-driven service architecture, we're using&nbsp;<strong>Kafka</strong>&nbsp;to let services communicate together asynchronously and resiliently.</p><p>We are also exploring to use&nbsp;<strong>Typescript&nbsp;</strong>more and more on the backend as well. However, we don't see our Ruby development slowing down anytime soon.</p><p>You'll be expected to work on everything from the above, but we're not expecting deep knowledge in all of it. We strive to build up everything backed by code and reliable pipelines which will get you on track at lightning speed. We're always open to changes that can make us better!</p><p>We work in small cross-functional teams that usually consist of 3 developers, a designer, and a product manager. You’ll be part of the whole feature development lifecycle. You’ll see all the feedback we collected from our customers and you will be encouraged to come up with your ideas or objections.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>As a core member of our team, you care about solving real problems for real users. Coding, to you, is more art than mechanics and analytical thinking comes second nature.</p><p>You like communicating with frontend or product management and you always keep the end-user in mind. &nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>2+ years of experience building backend systems</p></li><li>Experience with some parts of our tech stack is always welcome (messaging, AWS, k8s, Typescript, SPAs)</li><li><p>Your code is clean and well tested, you own development from discovery to production deployment</p></li><li>You love to learn and constantly improve your own skills and are not afraid to jump into new things</li><li><p>You could win a debate on tabs vs. spaces conducted entirely in English (we have an international team and are successful at keeping discussions in English)</p></li><li>You live in Europe – as it's important for us to have the team in pretty much the same timezone </li></ul><p><strong>Remote</strong></p><p>At productboard, we recently started building fully remote teams. It is, therefore, possible to join us as an engineer while being (almost) 100% remote. The expectation is that you will travel to Prague roughly every six weeks to collaborate with your remote team members in person, while also meeting other team members and learning more about the productboard culture. If you're interested in taking on this position remotely, make sure you tick off (most of) these requirements:</p><ul><li>You’re self-organized and disciplined</li><li>You have amazing communication skills</li><li>You know how to make sure everyone on the team feels included</li><li>Nice to have: previous experience with remote work</li></ul><p><strong><strong>About productboard&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><p>productboard is the product management system of choice for everyone from Avast and Microsoft to rising stars like Metromile and Envoy.

They are what makes Productboard unique. That is why we wish for more people who would further our abilities and knowledge. Nowadays we know we are building a globally successful product. It is clear that every challenge will be bigger than the previous one and we are persuaded we have a lot to offer. This is a thank you to everyone who is in it with us.</p><p><strong>Environment where you will love to work</strong></p><p>You are part of the team. Everyone has their role, every line of code counts. Any idea could push us a mile further, any opinion could save us weeks worth of time. What we want is for you to love going to work. We want you to have everything you need so that you do not lose the enthusiasm you came here with. How can we guarantee that? First of all, we treat each other with respect. Never-ending investments into the company and its employees go hand in hand with that. All that influenced by the realization that people need to see that they are a part of the result and that we are counting on them.</p><p><strong>Transparency is who we are</strong></p><p>Our culture is built on trust and transparency, and you will be exposed to every step and decision of a fast-growing startup. Politics that stifle creativity and trust are intentionally left out. There is lots to learn, and lots to build. Daniel and Hubert have openly shared their vision from day one, and the entire company lives and breathes these values. It is important to them that everyone is informed about all things productboard — both the highs AND the lows.</p><p>All of us have easy access to business metrics and what each team throughout the company is working on. Thanks to this level of transparency, we know exactly where the company stands at all times and see how we fit in.</p><p><strong>Learning and growing together</strong></p><p>Creating a nurturing environment that fosters learning is critical. We understand that when individual employees grow, we all grow. At productboard, you’ll find experts in design, user experience, development, and customer experience who are all generous with their knowledge. Each month, we host management reading clubs to inspire each other new insights and reads.</p><p>Our welcome package doesn’t only include swag (though we have that too) — each new hire receives a book called Inspired. Written by&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Marty-Cagan/e/B00J21JTNM/ref=dp_byline_cont_book_1' rel='nofollow'>Marty Cagan</a>, the “godfather of product management,” it covers the product management philosophy and best practices that productboard is built on. It is a must-read for us all.</p><p><strong>Kill your ego and let's make better products</strong></p><p>At productboard, we make products that matter, together. None of us joined productboard to simply make more money or our CVs more appealing. We are here because of our passion for helping product managers build outstanding products.</p><p>As our CEO Hubert Palan puts it, “I just want every product, every service, every experience to be delightful.”</p><p>Our vision is one of a world full of products that function and delight.

We do this with a new kind of document editor that saves you time and helps you do your best work. We’ve built:</p><ul><li><strong>A user-created library of templated docs</strong>, so you never have to start from scratch</li><li><strong>Workspaces&nbsp;</strong>that bring your team together in a single home for your work</li><li><strong>Powerful search</strong>&nbsp;that gets you to the right doc, every time</li><li><strong>Linked document versions</strong>, so you can merge or update multiple docs in one tap</li><li><strong>Approvals</strong>&nbsp;to keep your team aligned and on track through complex workflows</li></ul><p>We've seen professionals waste too much time managing information across disorganized documents instead of doing meaningful work. We believe this problem isn’t rooted in a lack of knowledge in the world, but in the deficiencies of tools we rely on to access, share, and improve how work gets done.</p><p>We’ve been moving fast since we founded Almanac in January 2019. Almanac is now used by over 4000 teams and sees over 50,000 visitors per month to its public Core of knowledge. We’ve raised a $8M+ from leading Silicon Valley investors with a lean (not mean) team of 10 people.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Well-oiled remote culture</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Strong ownership over a large-scope problem</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with a killer dev team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with a product team with over 40 years of combined experience</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Semi-annual team retreats</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

That means you work where and when you want.</p><p>Culture is really important to us. But building culture in a remote team can be difficult. We do a lot of things to try to remedy that. Chief among them are our annual retreats. Last year our retreat was in Lisbon, Portugal. We had a hackathon, broke out of escape rooms, and ate lots of good food.</p><p>There's always something challenging to work and great people to spend your days with building things at Hubstaff.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible schedule</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote / Work from home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Job security / Long term</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
