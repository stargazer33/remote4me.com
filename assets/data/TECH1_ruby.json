We were established a year ago and were recently acquired by Impero, a market leader in online safety. We’re a remote UK-based team and are looking for a Ruby on Rails Engineer to join us.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We believe in creating careers, not jobs. During your time with us you’ll receive regular, honest, helpful feedback. We’ll be looking for ways to grow your expertise, and we will provide opportunities for your professional development.&nbsp;Although we’re a remote team, we speak every day, and arrange regular meetings both by department and as a company.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We are first and foremost looking for developers who can demonstrate strong engineering principles, and whether you’ve been developing for one year or five we may have a role for you. We can offer you the technical challenges, high standards and opportunity to make a difference to our products. We have an exciting roadmap ahead and you can be part of that journey as we transition from a startup to a global product offering.

There’ll be a fit for you.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Our platform is built exclusively in Ruby on Rails, and we’re working towards continuous delivery - we currently deploy something every day of the week. We do the majority of our work and daily communication through Slack, with regular conference calls, screen shares, and opportunities for pair programming. We run two-weekly sprints in a kanban fashion, but don’t get bogged down in the process. Our roadmap and in-flight boards are managed with Trello, and code is peer reviewed regularly through Github. We’re running above 90% code coverage, with a test suite written in RSpec and continuous integration to run these tests and code quality metrics.</p><p><b>Required skills:</b></p><ul><li>Experience and skills developing web application with Ruby on Rails</li><li>Experience with MySQL/MariaDB or another relational database</li><li>Experience with HTML, CSS and jQuery</li><li>Experience with using Git or Subversion</li><li>An interest in test-driven development</li><li>Enthusiasm for understanding technical ideas and explaining them clearly to other members of the team</li><li>An appreciation of when things &quot;look right&quot;: we don't expect you to be a designer (we have designers for that!) but we like attention to detail</li><li>A willingness to provide technical support to the team and occasionally customers</li><li>Comfortable using macOS as your day-to-day operating system, or happy to learn</li><li>A strong standard of spoken and written English</li><li>An interest in the context and use of your work across education and safeguarding</li></ul> <b>Other things that might be useful:</b> <ul><li>Experience in writing specs with RSpec</li><li>Experience working with and on Linux/Unix operating systems</li><li>Experience in server automation using Terraform or Puppet</li><li>Experience with data analysis, using R or a similar tool</li><li>Experience working remotely and in an agile environment</li></ul> <b>The highlights:</b> <p></p><ul><li>Work remotely, with travel covered fortraining days and team building</li><li>Essential hardware provided, including a laptop and VOIP phone</li><li>Full training, including safeguarding, health and safety and information security</li><li>Staff Employee Assistance Program</li><li>28 days' holiday pro-rata, including bank holidays</li><li>Regular wage and benefits reviews</li><li>(Negotiable) reduced hours outside term time</li></ul><p>Send your CV to <a href='mailto:techjobs@safeguardingmonitor.co.uk' rel='nofollow'>techjobs@safeguardingmonitor.co.uk</a> and tell us in a personalised covering email why you are interested in this opportunity.

It will feel as fluid and natural as it does to text or call someone today, but even more personal and human .</p><p>This reality is still a way off, but we’re super excited to start building it now through simple and delightful video-focused products.</p><p>To help us get there, we’re looking for a Software Engineer of Infrastructure who is excited to help our engineering teams solve challenging problems.</p><p><strong>As an infrastructure software engineer at Wistia, you can expect to lead projects such as the following.</strong></p><ul><li>Improve our in-house deployment platform by having it expose access to new Kubernetes options or more effectively use Kubernetes primitives, or finding ways to make our Jenkins-based CI system more pleasant to use for other engineers</li><li>Gather feedback from colleagues to identify workflow frictions or architectural problems across our codebases and advise and assist with improvements, such as by measuring the current load of different pieces of a system, identifying problem libraries or other system components and suggesting a solution or vetting a replacement, or planning out the steps of a complex refactoring across services.</li><li>Make a manual infrastructure operation more automatic or declarative, e.g. by building a tool to sync our DNS zones from a source-controlled config file or by writing a bot to show us output in new infrastructure pull requests</li><li>Advise our application development teams on how best to architect a new feature, including evaluating a datastore for a particular new workload, designing data flows to keep app containers stateless, deciding how to best employ AWS primitives, and identifying and avoiding single points of failure</li><li>Improve observability across our Rails and Elixir codebases and Linux hosts via logging and instrumentation, identify performance bottlenecks across systems, and recommend configuration or application design improvements to handle growing system scale</li><li>Update our Chef recipes to be compatible with new software versions or to apply security patches, bake the updates into new VM images, and roll out new images to all our clusters</li></ul><p>We are looking for someone who is excited to support our engineering colleagues on other teams and flexible enough to work at any level of our stack. We won’t expect you to know all the tools we use on your first day, as long as you’re eager to learn and you thrive working collaboratively. We’re a small team, so we will also value experiences and skillsets that complement our existing strengths.</p><p><strong>Here are some qualities we look for in Wistia engineers, and why we feel they’re so important:</strong></p><ul><li>Learn continuously. We’re constantly faced with the unknown at Wistia. We won’t expect you to have an answer ready for every question, but we value the ability to quickly learn new technologies as you go.</li><li>Collaborate often. Whether through pair programming, a whiteboard session, or a casual lunch conversation, collaboration helps the best ideas and practices to proliferate.</li><li>Communicate effectively. Our work routinely affects our customers, their viewers, and other Wistians. Whether gathering feedback on a design proposal, updating colleagues on a project’s progress, pairing on a tough problem, or writing documentation, it is critical our communication be clear and concise to reach a shared vision.</li><li>Show empathy for colleagues. We value our colleagues more than our code. Being respectful, leaving space for others, and trying to understand someone else’s perspective instead of just defending your own are all critical to maintaining a team where everyone can feel included and empowered to do their best work.</li><li>Write clean and understandable code. We write code for each other and for our future selves. Code that is clear and tested sets us up for speed, reliability, and a more enjoyable development experience.</li><li>Navigate complex trade-offs. Most hard decisions involve trade-offs. Do we want our distributed database to be more consistent, or more available? Should we use a hosted product that will save us time now, but force us to move to a new system in a year? These are regular conversations!</li><li>Think for yourself. We hire people because we value their unique thoughts, insights and experiences. These things matter a great deal more to us than conventional wisdom or herd mentalities in technical communities.</li><li>Strive for simplicity<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Blaise Pascal once wrote, “I’m sorry I wrote you such a long letter; I didn’t have time to write a short one.” Making things simple and elegant is deceptively difficult, but it’s worth the effort because the result is easier to understand and work with.</li></ul><p>We’re profitable, growing, and independent of venture funding, so we have the luxury of being able to invest in whatever will best serve the long-term value of the company. We know the biggest investment we can make is in our employees, so we provide:</p><ul><li>A competitive salary</li><li>401k with 3% company contribution, regardless of whether you make contributions</li><li><strong>Flexible hours</strong></li><li>Fully paid healthcare, dental and vision coverage for you and your family and a healthcare FSA</li><li>Up to 12 weeks paid family leave</li><li>Untracked vacation and sick leave (most employees take about four weeks of vacation)</li><li>Transportation subsidies</li><li>Financial support for continuing education, professional development and sponsorship for conferences</li><li>A convenient office just south of Central Square in Cambridge, MA. We’re right on the Red Line, surrounded by great restaurants, parks, and even a dog park.</li></ul><p>We are working hard to make Wistia an inclusive and diverse place where everyone feels happy, fulfilled, respected, comfortable, and welcome. We want you to have fun here! Come join us and let’s build really cool things together.</p><p><strong>This role is open to local candidates based out of our Cambridge, MA office or remote candidates authorized to work in the US</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Remote candidates must have prior experience working successfully on a distributed team, as the role is for a fully distributed team within our mixed remote &amp; in-office Engineering department.</strong></p><p>If you would like to apply, please link or upload any resources that will help us understand your background and your strengths.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/wistia/jobs/1323870' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

I moved across the world for this job and I haven't regretted it for a second. Cogent is a lovely, warm and humane company. I've managed to convince my boss to let me travel the world and work remotely a couple of months per year. I also work part-time so that I can work on my videography business, and nobody raises an eyebrow at that. It's all very flexible!</p><p>Cogent is kind of a consultancy. We have a vision of becoming &quot;Melbourne's most loved maker of novel digital businesses&quot;. So a lot of what we do is based on working out of clients' offices. But we do other things as well. I spend my time working on a pretty damn cool electric car charger startup we've invested in.</p><p>We're a values-driven company, which gives us benefits such as an open salaries model, profit share and a strong focus on work-life balance like the flexibility mentioned above. We also work with clients that align well with our values.</p><p>Cogent is looking for mid-level and senior software developers with 5+ years of experience. We use Ruby and JS quite a bit, so commercial experience with those would make us go &quot;ooooh!&quot;</p><p>If this sounds interesting, have a look at our site: <a href='https://cogent.co' rel='nofollow'>https://cogent.co</a></p><p>Or drop me an email to ask me about life at Cogent or in Australia: peter@cogent.co</p></span>",

    "content": "<span>TrueCar | Santa Monica, CA | ONSITE or REMOTE | Full-Time | <a href='https://truecar.com' rel='nofollow'>https://truecar.com</a><p>TrueCar is hiring engineers to help us improve the car buying experience. We're on the verge of finishing up our replatforming initiative, and we're getting ready to re-accelerate our product development and further improve our infrastructure.</p><p>A good chunk of our engineering team, including leadership, came from CarWoo (YC S08). We value moving fast, structuring things so that we can keep moving fast, and not being afraid to do hard things. (This is sounds so obvious on HN, but it can be a hard sell sometimes when you're in the automotive industry.)</p><p>The core development frameworks we use are Rails and React. Our data stores include PostgreSQL, Redshift, Elasticsearch, and HBase. For infrastructure management, we use Terraform and Ansible. All of this runs on AWS.</p><p>Our core consumer- and dealer-facing application is a Rails application with a React frontend, backed by PostgreSQL and Redis. It's an intentionally monolithic Rails API. We also have other Rails apps for data curation, infrastructure management, and data movement to facilitate a lot of the workflows around data that add value and speed up our development.</p><p>We've also built internal tooling whenever it helps us move faster or drastically reduce the amount of manual work for our teammates. One of our tools, Spacepods, is a Rails app that churns out identical, isolated development environments (complete with data sets) so there's a mini-TrueCar that each engineer can start developing against immediately, without having to worry about breaking a shared integration environment that other developers depend on. Spacepods also powers our deployments and coordinates our CI/CD pipeline.</p><p>Openings:</p><p>- Senior Rails Engineer. You've run Rails at scale and know Ruby and Rails really, really well. &quot;Convention over configuration&quot; is always nice to get started, but you've had to roll up your sleeves and configure things, ranging from Ruby VM internals to caching layers to connection pooling. You'd be working on the Rails app that powers our consumer-facing experience.</p><p>- Senior Rails Engineer (Platform). You've run Rails at scale, maybe in a smaller company, and have thought to yourself at some point, &quot;If only we had the resources to build developer tools to make our processes better and more repeatable.&quot; You'll probably have a lot of fun in this role if you like working on the tooling that gets used by other engineers and get a kick out of enabling others to be 10x/100x more productive.</p><p>- Site Reliability Engineer. You know Linux systems, networking, and/or AWS really well. Each team member has a slightly different emphasis but everyone on the team has in common is that we value reliability, observability, and performance.</p><p>- Site Reliability Engineer (Data). Measure, monitor, and understand YARN/HDFS/HBase performance in production. Design/architect deployment and verification procedures for data pipelines. One of the overarching and continuing challenges here is to take everything great that everyone loves about DevOps and CI/CD, and apply it to our data pipelines. Inherent statefulness and the size of the data make this a challenge.</p><p>- Data Warehouse Engineer. Write ETL to efficiently bring in data from various data sources, enrich it, and make it available to everyone in the company so our decisions are backed by good data. We make use of Postgres and Redshift.</p><p>Even if you're not sure you fit in any one of the above, please reach out if any of this sounds interesting to you. (If you read all the way down here, it's a good sign that we should talk!) At the end of the day, we're just looking for smart, determined, pragmatic people who love building things and solving problems. We care less about hitting all the bullet points in a job description.</p><p>Still interested, or just want to talk? Reach out to me at jgo AT truecar.com</p></span>",

Code that is clear and tested sets us up for speed, reliability, and a more enjoyable development experience.</li><strong>Write clean and understandable code.</strong><li>&nbsp;Most hard decisions involve trade-offs.

After a terrible experience trying to buy a mattress, the team set out to make a mattress and experience that people could love.We view Tuft &amp; Needle not as a mattress company that makes software, but as a software company that sells mattresses. We’re a small team of passionate full-stack developers. We frequently seek out advice from each other and believe in continuous learning. We’re incredibly focused on results and don’t expect specific, regular hours in the office (we have a pretty sweet office though). Although sometimes we pair program, we aren’t religious about it. We believe process should be extracted from things that are working well.&nbsp;We’re looking for another full-stack Ruby/Rails developer to join our growing engineering team in Phoenix. You'll get to work on <a href='http://tuftandneedle.com/' rel='nofollow'>tuftandneedle.com</a> as well as our internal customer experience and administration systems while collaborating with the rest of the engineering team on strategic decisions.<strong>Our Technical Environment:</strong>Our stack consists primarily of Ruby, Rails, Postgres, React.js, CoffeeScript, HAML and SCSS and is deployed to Heroku and S3. We use CircleCI for continuous integration and believe strongly in continuous deployment. Refactor without fear and ship daily! We also believe in leveraging quality APIs and tools.Qualities We're Looking For:<ul><li>At least 5 years prior experience working in a tech environment similar to what's described above</li><li>Empathy</li><li>Pragmatism</li><li>Curiosity</li><li>A love for learning</li><li>Phoenix locals (or those willing to relocate) strongly preferred</li><li>Excellent communication skills</li><li>The ability to see projects through to completion</li></ul><p>Values of the Engineering Team:</p><ul><li>End-to-end ownership: Each project gets an Engineering owner that is responsible for the success of the project.</li><li>Launch early and iterate: Done is better than perfect. Although we maintain a minimum standard of quality, we believe in getting value out of features and enhancements as soon as possible, while rapidly iterating.</li><li>Do things that don’t scale: We believe that our software should automate existing manual processes to save time, rather than preempt potential needs to avoid building unnecessary software. Our litmus test for deciding on new features is “Has the team done this manually first?”. Of course, we’re pragmatic even about this value.</li><li>Pragmatism: In a growing startup, our philosophy is that it’s important to be pragmatic. We are rarely dogmatic and use Judo moves to efficiently solve problems.</li></ul><p>Time &amp; Benefits:</p><ul><li>Ability to work remotely</li><li>Full time, 40 hours a week</li><li>Located in Downtown Phoenix- remote work is available</li><li>Free mattress and other products</li><li>Health benefits for employee and dependents</li><li>Paid Maternity/Paternity leave for eligible employees</li><li>401k with company match</li><li>Generous vacation and sick leave policy</li><li>Monthly company events</li><li>Snacks and drinks stocked in the fridge</li><li>Casual dress code, open office environment</li></ul>                </div>            </div><div>How to apply:<br><a href='https://careers.tn.com/position/?id=f345d112-6300-423b-afa8-d12f54df3c77' rel='nofollow'>careers.tn.com/position/</a></div>",

We develop B2B/SaaS solutions to facilitate market and opinion research in &gt;100 countries. Our system is built using a microservices architecture and our technical environment consists primarily of Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, MySQL, Mongo, bash, Javascript, React, Redux, and AWS.</p>  <p>We are looking for skilled engineers with varying levels of experience, who can help us expand our products and applications. Curious about what our platform looks like underneath the hood? Check out this blog post on our platform backend!</p>  <p>The journey that awaits you:</p>  <ul>   <li>We offer a relaxed, encouraging, welcoming, yet challenging environment, in which you will feel comfortable to propose your own ideas, and have the ability to see them through to completion.</li>   <li>Fun monthly team events (like ziplining, escape rooms, cooking with refugees, spartan race, and more! ) and the good company of an eclectic, international team.</li>   <li>The opportunity to grow, not just as a developer, but as a person. At Dalia, you have a yearly education fund to spend on self-development such as learning German, going to conferences, or on personal coaching.</li>  </ul>  <p>Your challenge:</p>  <ul>   <li>Develop, enhance, and maintain our Ruby-on-Rails web application platform, based on multiple microservices collaborating through APIs.</li>   <li>Deliver clean, maintainable and error proof code with good test coverage. Write test automation, conduct code reviews, and take end-to-end ownership, from development to production.</li>   <li>Develop web apps that present meaningful analytics results to users, including data visualization on a modern HTML5 / JS / RoR stack. Furthermore, &nbsp;work with our data science team to bring abstract statistical methods into production.</li>  </ul>  <p>Your profile includes:</p>  <ul>   <li>You have some (minimum 2 years) development experience within a professional setting. Ideally, you have proven expertise with Ruby and with the Ruby on Rails framework, as well as proficiency with at least one other programming language.</li>   <li>If you have a strong desire to work with Ruby on Rails and are already proficient in Python, Perl, Elixir or another language, you are also welcome to apply for our junior roles.</li>   <li>Self-motivation: you step up to the plate and propose ideas and projects that enable optimal workflows and innovative solutions.</li>   <li>Strong inner drive to get things done: you are able to work autonomously, and have a clear direction in a rapidly changing and often ambiguous environment; you possess the ability to set and deliver against tight deadlines.</li>  </ul>  <p>What else makes Dalia awesome?</p>  <ul>   <li>No “ninja” culture – teamwork here is paramount, and that means others will help you when you need it. Mentorship can be available.</li>   <li>Occasional remote work is possible.</li>   <li>A well-stocked kitchen, where you can request grocery items.</li>   <li>A team boat that we built ourselves!</li>  </ul> </div><a href='https://grnh.se/b43f192d1' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this position</a>",

After a terrible experience trying to buy a mattress, the team set out to make a mattress and experience that people could love.We view Tuft &amp; Needle not as a mattress company that makes software, but as a software company that sells mattresses. We’re a small team of passionate full-stack developers. We frequently seek out advice from each other and believe in continuous learning. We’re incredibly focused on results and don’t expect specific, regular hours in the office (we have a pretty sweet office though). Although sometimes we pair program, we aren’t religious about it. We believe process should be extracted from things that are working well.&nbsp;We’re looking for another full-stack Ruby/Rails developer to join our growing engineering team in Phoenix. You'll get to work on  as well as our internal customer experience and administration systems while collaborating with the rest of the engineering team on strategic decisions.<strong>Our Technical Environment:</strong>Our stack consists primarily of Ruby, Rails, Postgres, React.js, CoffeeScript, HAML and SCSS and is deployed to Heroku and S3. We use CircleCI for continuous integration and believe strongly in continuous deployment. Refactor without fear and ship daily! We also believe in leveraging quality APIs and tools.Qualities We're Looking For:</p><ul><li>At least 5 years prior experience working in a tech environment similar to what's described above</li><li>Empathy</li><li>Pragmatism</li><li>Curiosity</li><li>A love for learning</li><li>Phoenix locals (or those willing to relocate) strongly preferred</li><li>Excellent communication skills</li><li>The ability to see projects through to completion</li></ul><p>Values of the Engineering Team:</p><ul><li>End-to-end ownership: Each project gets an Engineering owner that is responsible for the success of the project.</li><li>Launch early and iterate: Done is better than perfect. Although we maintain a minimum standard of quality, we believe in getting value out of features and enhancements as soon as possible, while rapidly iterating.</li><li>Do things that don’t scale: We believe that our software should automate existing manual processes to save time, rather than preempt potential needs to avoid building unnecessary software. Our litmus test for deciding on new features is “Has the team done this manually first?”. Of course, we’re pragmatic even about this value.</li><li>Pragmatism: In a growing startup, our philosophy is that it’s important to be pragmatic. We are rarely dogmatic and use Judo moves to efficiently solve problems.</li></ul><p>Time &amp; Benefits:</p><ul><li>Ability to work remotely</li><li>Full time, 40 hours a week</li><li>Located in Downtown Phoenix- remote work is available</li><li>Free mattress and other products</li><li>Health benefits for employee and dependents</li><li>Paid Maternity/Paternity leave for eligible employees</li><li>401k with company match</li><li>Generous vacation and sick leave policy</li><li>Monthly company events</li><li>Snacks and drinks stocked in the fridge</li><li>Casual dress code, open office environment</li></ul><p></p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

After a terrible experience trying to buy a mattress, the team set out to make a mattress and experience that people could love.We view Tuft &amp; Needle not as a mattress company that makes software, but as a software company that sells mattresses. We’re a small team of passionate full-stack developers. We frequently seek out advice from each other and believe in continuous learning. We’re incredibly focused on results and don’t expect specific, regular hours in the office (we have a pretty sweet office though). Although sometimes we pair program, we aren’t religious about it. We believe process should be extracted from things that are working well.&nbsp;We’re looking for another full-stack Ruby/Rails developer to join our growing engineering team in Phoenix. You'll get to work on <a href='http://tuftandneedle.com/' rel='nofollow'>tuftandneedle.com</a> as well as our internal customer experience and administration systems while collaborating with the rest of the engineering team on strategic decisions.<strong>Our Technical Environment:</strong>Our stack consists primarily of Ruby, Rails, Postgres, React.js, CoffeeScript, HAML and SCSS and is deployed to Heroku and S3. We use CircleCI for continuous integration and believe strongly in continuous deployment. Refactor without fear and ship daily! We also believe in leveraging quality APIs and tools.Qualities We're Looking For:<ul><li>At least 5 years prior experience working in a tech environment similar to what's described above</li><li>Empathy</li><li>Pragmatism</li><li>Curiosity</li><li>A love for learning</li><li>Phoenix locals (or those willing to relocate) strongly preferred</li><li>Excellent communication skills</li><li>The ability to see projects through to completion</li></ul><p>Values of the Engineering Team:</p><ul><li>End-to-end ownership: Each project gets an Engineering owner that is responsible for the success of the project.</li><li>Launch early and iterate: Done is better than perfect. Although we maintain a minimum standard of quality, we believe in getting value out of features and enhancements as soon as possible, while rapidly iterating.</li><li>Do things that don’t scale: We believe that our software should automate existing manual processes to save time, rather than preempt potential needs to avoid building unnecessary software. Our litmus test for deciding on new features is “Has the team done this manually first?”. Of course, we’re pragmatic even about this value.</li><li>Pragmatism: In a growing startup, our philosophy is that it’s important to be pragmatic. We are rarely dogmatic and use Judo moves to efficiently solve problems.</li></ul><p>Time &amp; Benefits:</p><ul><li>Ability to work remotely</li><li>Full time, 40 hours a week</li><li>Located in Downtown Phoenix- remote work is available</li><li>Free mattress and other products</li><li>Health benefits for employee and dependents</li><li>Paid Maternity/Paternity leave for eligible employees</li><li>401k with company match</li><li>Generous vacation and sick leave policy</li><li>Monthly company events</li><li>Snacks and drinks stocked in the fridge</li><li>Casual dress code, open office environment</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://careers.tn.com/position/?id=f345d112-6300-423b-afa8-d12f54df3c77' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Tuft &amp; Needle</h3>            <div><p>Tuft &amp; Needle was founded in 2012 by two software engineers who quit their jobs in Silicon Valley and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. In a $14 billion industry full of marketing gimmicks, unfair markups, sales commissions, and overwhelming options, we've used an iterative design and development process to create superior, honest products at a fair price. That philosophy is reflected in everything we do.</p><p>A developer mindset guides every aspect of our business — from the products we create to the day-to-day operations of the company — we ideate, iterate, and constantly improve. We believe process should be extracted from things that are working well, not just what we’ve done in the past. We are hyper-focused on results, and don’t expect our team to hold specific office hours (although we do have a pretty sweet office). We aren’t against formal scrum sprints and stand-ups, but have found that our team works well without them.</p><p>Check out our developer site to meet our digital team at developer.tn.com!</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Medical and Dental monthly premiums paid by T&amp;N</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Paid Maternity and Paternity Leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dollar-for-dollar 401K match (up to 4%)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation Days</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>HSA Contribution</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Wide range of snacks and drinks stocked in the fridge</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Beautiful office with options to work in open or private settings</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Free mattress upon joining the team</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

You will likely be wasting your time.</p><p>A successful startup in Southern California is looking for an experienced hands on Director/VP of Engineering to take their web presence to the next level. In a nutshell, you can think of their product as a Whole Foods store but for your canine. Although this may sound odd, based on their meteoric growth over the last few years, there is a huge market for pet owners that only want the best for Fido. They now have over 13 storefront locations, too many authorized retailers and veterinary partners to count, they are also beginning to have a significant web presence with online ordering and shipping capabilities.</p><p>This is what they need: They need a true visionary with startup and project management experience. They are not simply looking for a heads-down Ruby on Rails guru because currently they have no in-house tech capabilities and have been farming the actual development to an overseas firm in Sweden. The right candidate should spike on product management and architecture more than the coding itself. They are looking for somebody who is hungry for success and wants to build a team and own the tech of a fast-growing PE-backed startup.</p><p>This position is not for everybody, they need somebody who truly want to make their mark on a successful, one-of-a-kind startup. They want somebody who can prove that they are hungry. This person will likely have startup experience, a strong academic background, exceptional communication skills, project management skills, hands-on knowledge of RoR architecture and the rest of their tech stack.

We're a growing team with a lot of backend knowledge so we're hoping to round the team out by adding someone with a good eye for UI/UX.</p><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING</strong></p><p>Your work will be heavily focused toward high level, high impact areas. You’ll work closely with Product Managers and Designers to plan, design, and implement some of our more complex features while keeping our UI fresh and modern. You’ll have a strong voice in the development and planning processes, so past senior level experience is key.</p><p>We work in weekly sprints and use Pivotal Tracker to keep things organized. While we keep meetings to a minimum, our remote team is heavily collaborative and takes advantage of modern tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Hangouts to stay in touch.</p><p>Our stack includes Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Postgres and Heroku. We’re currently on Rails 5 and strive to keep our frameworks and libraries up to date.</p><p>This is a position we consider essential to the company’s success. Be sure to mention coffee in your application so we know you actually read this.</p><p><strong>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU</strong></p><ul><li>Be a part of an incredible team of “A” players who go above and beyond to make Fleetio a successful company.

Crafting a delightful user experience is hard work, but we welcome the challenge and are looking for team members who share our ambition.</p><p>We’re a startup that’s in “scale up” mode, meaning we’re past the days of just a couple of people in a small office, but we’re still very much a fast-paced, highly collaborative company.</p><p>About 40% of our team works remotely and we’re committed to fostering a tight-knit team through various collaboration tools.

We now need to incrementally build out our own stack and therefore need an experienced, hands on dev to kick start and grow our tech team. </span></p><p><span>You’ll be working directly with the CEO (me) and the growth team to plan and incrementally build out our tech stack. I’ve built out software and data-science teams, am a Rails dev/geek and (I hope) not a dick so we should get along well.</span></p><p><span>We’ll work on delivering value quickly without skipping on important stuff like good test coverage, thoughtfully refactored code and a CI suite. My plan is to quickly grow the tech team as we prove value to the board. You’ll have the opportunity to grow into a management position (although the CTO will probably need to be Sydney based) or just keep your head down cutting code.</span></p><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><ul><li><span>Experience professionally developing software in Rails</span></li><ul><li><span>In a senior role at a startup </span></li><li><span>Working fullstack </span></li></ul><li><span>An understanding and appreciation of</span></li><ul><li><span>User-friendly software</span></li><li><span>Delivering value (customer, business)</span></li></ul><li><span>Experience integrating with other tech: CRMs, ERPs etc</span></li><li><span>A range of front-end technologies</span></li><li><span>The foundations: various DBs, DevOps, TDD, Queuing, REST APIs etc etc</span></li><li><span>The ability to think architecturally: build or SaaS, monolith or services, when to spike vs when to ensure quality</span></li><li><span>Open-source experience and an understanding of growth marketing a plus.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Remote &amp; flexible</strong></p><p><span>We’re based in Sydney but the team’s scattered around Au and NZ so we constantly interact with each other remotely.

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of the development team building our content management system(CMS) that powers our mobile and web applications. &nbsp;You will get to come to work everyday knowing you are helping educate millions of people all around the world.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned JavaScript developer and have a solid knowledge of modern JS frameworks.</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Vue.js, Postgres, Heroku and Rails.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and PTO.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p><p>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a web app, node package or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p><p><strong>Life at HLT</strong></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Remote working</li><li>Flexible hours</li><li>Large amounts of autonomy</li><li>Great pay, insurance, benefits</li></ul><p><strong>So Why HLT?</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in</p><ul><li>Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks</li><li>Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education</li><li>A fast paced and fun work environment</li><li>A career with a higher purpose</li></ul><p>Then we we would love to talk to you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/196220?reset=False&amp;ra=13NYEKqt7OyA&amp;oqs=a%3D13NYEKqt7OyA' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large amounts of autonomy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great pay, insurance, benfits</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

    "content": "<p>Loco2 is an online booking service for train travel throughout the UK and Europe. Our mission is to make booking trains anywhere in Europe as easy and affordable as possible, from epic international adventures to everyday local commutes. </p><p>We’ve been selling tickets since 2012 and having reached market leader status, we recently became part of the Voyages-sncf group. We remain operationally independent but this partnership has given us the resources to get to the next stage of our journey.</p><p><strong>About us</strong></p><p>We're a <a href='https://loco2.com/team' rel='nofollow'>close-knit, passionate and cosmopolitan team</a>, and care deeply about building an inclusive, open and supportive work environment. We have a flexible location-agnostic approach to hiring, which means we hire the best person for the job, regardless of geography. Our team is spread across eight countries and we’re growing fast! </p><p>Our success is built on trust, empathy and shared knowledge, with both customers and colleagues at the centre of what we do. <a href='https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/loco2.com' rel='nofollow'>We're proud to have an average rating of 9.3 out of 10 on Trustpilot</a> after over 30,000 reviews and a <a href='https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Overview/Working-at-Loco2-EI_IE1950853.11,16.htm' rel='nofollow'>4.9 out of 5-star rating</a> on Glassdoor! </p><p><em>Why join us?</em></p><ul><li>Freedom: base yourself in our bright, modern office in central London or take advantage of our remote-friendly culture by working from home.</li><li>We offer flexible hours: work around your schedule and when you’re most productive.</li><li>Our team enjoys a healthy work-life balance and don’t think caffeine-fuelled all-nighters are a good way to grow a company that’s built to last.</li><li>Team activities: Developer conferences, annual retreats and monthly Lunch &amp; Learns.</li><li>We have high coding standards, and follow best practices such as continuous testing and delivery.</li><li>We strive to learn and improve together in a supportive environment as the wider tech ecosystem evolves.</li><li>Our days are not full of meetings and distractions. Allowing others to achieve flow is a big part of supporting each other.</li><li>Everyone is encouraged to ask questions, think creatively and suggest new working practices. We have a small team so your voice will be heard.</li></ul><p>We believe that diversity of background and experience contributes to a broader collective perspective that will consistently lead to a better company and better products. We are working hard to increase the diversity of our team wherever we can and we actively encourage everyone to consider becoming a part of it.</p><p><strong>Role description and tech stack</strong></p><p>We’re hiring experienced Ruby engineers to join our existing team, where you'll help us maintain and improve our existing infrastructure, integrate new rail operator booking systems and scale effectively for our rapidly expanding user base.</p><p>Our software stack consists of a pure-Ruby backend library which we use to communicate with train booking APIs, a modern Rails application, a PostgreSQL database, and two native mobile applications (iOS and Android).</p><p>We’re integrated with multiple rail operator booking systems (with our current team we usually complete at least 1-2 major integrations each year), and we’re increasingly consuming other types of data too (e.g. timetable data for routing, real-time arrivals/departures etc).</p><p>We need to diligently manage technical complexity, as each external system works in a slightly different way, with its own features and quirks. SOAP is (unfortunately) used by many operator APIs, which is why we released our open source library, <a href='https://github.com/loco2/lolsoap' rel='nofollow'>LolSoap</a>.</p><p>Some of the most difficult challenges we face relate to routing and making sense of lots of data. Which routes are best to get from A to B? Which booking systems should be queried? How might we cache data without affecting the accuracy of results?</p><p>We’ve recently released mobile applications for iOS and Android. Further developing our mobile strategy is a key goal for the business.</p><p>Because Loco2 is the merchant of record for all transactions we are also responsible for fraud prevention, and handling currency and other finance-related issues.</p><p>We frequently release new features that drive rapid organic growth, and so it’s vital that we anticipate and address scaling challenges before they occur.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>An ideal candidate:</p><ul><li>Has 4+ years of professional programming experience</li><li>Has deep knowledge and experience of Ruby</li><li>Is fluent in English and confident communicating and sharing complex information and learnings with both technical and non-technical team members</li><li>Has a good working knowledge of modern devops technologies such as Docker</li><li>Is comfortable designing object oriented software from scratch, not just implementing CRUD Rails apps; a pragmatist who can see the trade-offs involved in the different approaches to solving a problem</li><li>Strives to discover and understand the root cause of problems, suggesting new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms</li><li>Actively considers future maintainability when deciding how to implement something</li><li>Has a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed</li><li>Enjoys getting their teeth stuck into complicated problems, as well as being willing to pitch in on some of the more routine tasks which inevitably arise</li><li>Is willing to participate in an on-call rota to cover technical emergencies out of hours</li><li>Can work hours that have some overlap with London daytime</li><li>Is motivated by Loco2's mission</li></ul>",

    "content": "_About SpeechKit_    <br /><br />SpeechKit is a fast-growing audio-as-a-service product for news publishers. We are building a complete toolkit to assist in the production, distribution and monetisation of audio content that will help digital news publishers reach new audiences and engage existing subscribers.<br /><br />Our business is reaching an inflection point and we are quickly onboarding new publishers by the day. This business is quickly evolving into an exciting new provider of a brand new format of news.<br /><br />We are a lean team in a phase of consolidation. This is an opportunity to join an early stage business in a high growth market providing the first of its kind service.<br /><br />_The Role_<br /><br />We are looking for a mid-level engineer with experience in leading a team in building B2B Saas products. Whilst the role is for the lead engineer in our team, we are looking for a candidate that not only has experience across our stack but also shows a willingness and enthusiasm to lead our product development through this exciting phase. <br /><br />The role will involve, but not be limited to, the following; <br /><br />* Helping define the product roadmap alongside CEO and COO.<br />* Ownership and responsibility for technical product development.<br />* Hands-on technical development across the stack.<br />* Leadership and management of the technical team.<br /><br />We currently rely heavily on contractual work for the majority of our development. It will be your job to transition from this model and lay the foundations for a team capable of sustaining our growth through the following years.<br /><br />_Core technology stack experience:_<br /><br />* Ruby on Rails 5.<br />* Python (RSS/URL text extraction).<br />* PHP (WordPress plugin development).<br />* Javascript, HTML, CSS.<br />* PostgreSQL.<br />* ELK (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana).<br />* AWS, DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, Heroku.<br /><br />_What would make you stand out;_<br /><br />* Experience and interest in machine learning and speech synthesis.<br />* Google NLP API expertise.<br />* Audio encoding know-how (ffmpeg and HLS).<br />* Background in statistics.<br />* Voice/sound design experience.<br />* Experience with media players and advertising standards e.g., VAAST and DAAST.<br />* Experience with smart speaker technology e.g., Alexa and Google Home.<br />* Mobile SDK development.<br />* React Native.<br /><br />_More about SpeechKit_<br /><br />We are a young team who have been chasing a vision for on-the-go audio news for the best part of a decade. The two founders have 10 years experience running startups between them and Speechkit is an evolution of two previous startups that has moulded a business we believe to have hit a sweet spot in an emerging market. <br /><br />We launched an MVP product in March this year and have experienced 30% growth month-on-month since that launch. We are now entering a phase of consolidation of the product, marketing and business process to ensure steady growth into the next phase of the business. <br /><br />We are well funded and ready to scale the team and business to mirror our growth prospects. Currently, we are working semi-remote and will be taking office space in mid-September. This role will be location flexible, meaning you will, for the most part, be able to manage your time working from the location of your choice or have a desk at the office. <br /><br />_Salary and Perks_<br /><br />This is an opportunity to join a dynamic and exciting business at its inception. We are looking to at a base salary for this role of £65,000 and will make judgements on an increase if expertise expands into relevant fields. Share options will also be negotiated after 3 months of the role. Holiday will start at 25 days, with flexible working location conditions. We will endeavour to meet any other suggestions you have for the role and its rewards.",

New features are designed in collaboration with product managers and other teammates. Engineers exchange code reviews with other team members, provide mentorship to junior engineers, and assist QA and Ops in troubleshooting product issues.<br><br>Our primary backend platform is based on Python and Django and is supported by PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Solr. We also utilize Ruby on Rails in some key applications. Many of our applications and services are dockerized and deployed into Kubernetes clusters by Jenkins. While your focus will be on backend work, sometimes you will be called upon to make changes to our front-end codebase, which is based on Javascript (ES6), React, and Redux.<br><br>About You<br><br>We are interested in people who have experience building and supporting web applications with a diverse and engaged user base. &nbsp;We desire candidates who work comfortably in an agile environment and with collaborators who are distributed across multiple time zones. &nbsp;We value colleagues who are helpful, respectful, humble, and always willing to do what’s best for our users. We desire developers who treat automated tests as essential, and believe that code reviews are a crucial path of learning and of sharing knowledge. The women and men of our platform team have taken many traditional and nontraditional paths to the developer profession, and we welcome diverse teams that are bound together by a mutual love of learning.<br><br>Requirements<br><br><br>* 2 years of experience developing web applications and services<br><br>* Demonstrated competency with Python and Django<br><br>* Experience building and maintaining RESTful APIs<br><br>* Experience with automated testing and test-driven development<br><br>* Experience with continuous integration tools and a rapid release cycle<br><br><br><br><br>Experience Bonuses<br><br><br>* Django-REST-Framework<br><br>* Celery<br><br>* React and Redux<br><br>* Docker<br><br>* Kubernetes<br><br>* Microservice architecture<br><br>* RabbitMQ or similar messaging system<br><br>* Node.js<br><br>* Scrum<br><br>* Ruby on Rails<br><br>* Go<br><br><br><p>See more jobs at <span>O'reilly Media</span></p></div></div>",

When we ship great stuff, we’ll celebrate together!<br /><br />*What’s our tech stack?*<br /><br />Our platform is Rails 4, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch and Redis. The web frontend is Zurb Foundation, jQuery and CSS3.<br /><br />Code is in GitHub, our build pipeline runs on CircleCI and all our production systems run on Heroku, monitored using Logentries, Rollbar and NewRelic.<br /><br />Ideally, you know what all those things are and you’ve worked with most of them. Maybe you already have some ideas about how we could use them more effectively.<br /><br />We’ve also got standalone projects ranging from visualization tools built using React and Rails APIs, to a bespoke pipeline for deploying Go apps to Raspberry Pi touchscreen devices around our venue.<br /><br />*How we work*<br /><br />We aspire to be agile and test-driven - but we’re also pragmatists who try not to get too hung up on textbook definitions. <br /><br />On Monday mornings we review work in flight, pick up new stories, and decide what our focus for the week is going to be. We work on short-lived feature branches, we write unit and integration tests. We merge code as soon as it’s been reviewed and we deploy to production several times a day. On Friday afternoons, we review progress and share ideas for what we could do differently next time.<br /><br />*What’s it like working here?*<br /><br />With four developers and two product owners, we’re still a relatively small development team, but we’re part of a diverse, enthusiastic company of around fifty people (growing to 150 in the next 18 months) hailing from all over the world.<br /><br />You’ll be working at our office in Liverpool Street, London.
