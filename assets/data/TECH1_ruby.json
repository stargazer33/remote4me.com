They come to us looking for a team to provide dependable support and maintenance of their existing Ruby on Rails (and a handful of React) projects. We do this in the form of recurring retainers where we take care of small feature updates, bug fixes, performance improvements, chipping away at their technical debt, and helping them experiment as they navigate their forward as a business.</p><p>What we rarely do? Is spin up brand new web applications for them. We learned years ago that there is rarely a long-term client relationship with startups (as they tend to flop in 1-2 years). So, we stopped competing on those projects.</p><p>The tradeoff? We get to build lasting partnerships with our clients and have some influence on how they’re planning for their life of their web applications.</p><p>So…if you’re the type of developer that really enjoys shiny and new things (and/or pitching entire app rewrites)… this probably isn’t the position for you.</p><p>If you’re the type of developer that enjoys jumping into the deep end of complex projects, helping iterate and improve software, likes to take on responsibility and be given opportunities to help lead projects… then we should talk.</p><p><strong>Our Core Values</strong></p><ul><li>PROACTIVE – We actively seek opportunities to improve our client’s products, our processes, and our abilities.</li><li>CURIOUS – A natural curiosity for the undiscovered results in remarkable work for our clients – and stronger connections for our team. We ask questions, learn, and aren’t afraid to fail.</li><li>DEPENDABLE – We are invested in our work. We manage expectations. We support our clients and teammates. We hold ourselves, our teammates, and our clients accountable.</li><li>VERSATILE – We readily adapt to change and encourage innovation because our team and work are transparent and flexible.</li><li>DELIGHTFUL – We choose to set a mindful, positive tone that allows everyone to flourish.</li></ul><p>We are a small team and wear many hats. In addition to the list of responsibilities below we also expect all of our team members to participate in our marketing efforts, whether that’s you writing blog posts, offering to speak at a conference, or coming up with ideas for new initiatives.</p><p><strong>What you’ll typically be focused on…</strong></p><ul><li>Participating in short daily standups to outline what you completed yesterday and are aiming to accomplish today</li><li>Jumping between ~2-5 client projects/week (sometimes a few each day)</li><li>Keeping an eye out for your teammates. Perhaps you could lend them a hand to tackle a challenge and/or vice versa</li><li>Getting your head wrapped around a subset of our client projects and their business goals</li><li>Partnering up with your project manager to figure out how to best prioritize your work this coming week</li><li>Collaborating with your team members to help with these projects (from planning, estimating, coding, testing, and bug fixing)</li><li>Documenting the tricks and lessons you learn to share with the dev community on our blog</li><li>Asking clients for clarification on requirements that you aren’t sure that you understand</li><li>Being an advocate for the long-term health and maintainability of our client’s projects</li><li>Saying,&nbsp;<em>“I don’t know&nbsp;</em>(yet)<em>&nbsp;… but I’ll help figure it out!”</em>&nbsp;to clients and peers</li><li>Improving the overall test coverage of our client projects</li><li>Helping pick out music to play on the studio stereo system (unless you’re remote)</li><li>Performing code reviews on your teammate’s pull-requests</li><li>Googling weird error messages…a lot</li><li>Sharing praise when someone on the team does something amazing</li><li>Occassionally helping out with DevOps/sysadmin tasks</li><li>Sending your code for peer review</li><li>Stumbling across possible fixes in API docs, Stack Overflow, and Github issues</li><li><strong>Taking advantage of our flextime scheduling to swing by the gym, go for a run before the rain starts, or maybe sitting in the park with a book</strong></li><li>Rolling your eyes as you look at that code that wasn’t working and realizing the silly typo</li><li>Capturing your “lesson learned” to share with the team this next Monday morning</li><li>Communicating directly with clients to help define features/user stories, improvements to existing applications</li><li>Writing, refactoring, and improving our client’s web applications and APIs (…we have a few internal projects, too)</li><li>Sending clients a link to a staging environment so they can test out your changes before you deploy to production</li><li>Deploying code to staging/production environments</li><li>Petting the dog that swings by your desk to say hi (unless you’re remote…do you have your own dog to pet?)</li><li>Tracking time for our client work so that we can pay our bills</li><li>Appreciating when your teammates share their failures with you</li><li>Sitting down with interns/junior developers to hone your mentoring skills (or popping on a screen share if you’re remote)</li><li>Removing noise in the README files that we probably should have cleaned up a while ago</li><li>Thanking clients when they provide great requirements that helps you out</li><li>Sharing your hard lessons/failures with your peers</li><li>Noticing inefficiencies in our existing processes and taking note to raise it at our next team meeting</li><li>Adding useful information to the README files that will help your teammates</li><li>Carving out a little time each week to try out some new tools</li><li>Sharing useful links with your peers in Slack</li><li>Preparing a 5-to-10-minute talk on how to use said new tool for our next company workshop series</li><li>Helping us become a better version of ourselves than we were yesterday</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>3.141592653+ years of experience with Ruby on Rails</li><li>Ability to convey your thoughts/ideas verbally and written…with a delightful (and competent) tone</li><li>Experience collaborating with clients/stakeholders/decisionmakers/mimes.

We have much to learn about working in that way. We have some good ideas on how to make this work well — and will be mindful to take healthy steps together. It’ll not be perfect but we want to explore this with you.</strong></p><p>Responses from freelancers, design studios or recruiters offering their services will be ignored.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p>After three months of full-time employment, we provide:</p><ul><li>Medical &amp; dental insurance (PLANET ARGON pays 80% of premium);</li><li>SIMPLE IRA with 3% of employee salary match;</li><li>Paid vacation that increases with your length of employment; (15 days accrued the first year, 20 days after the first year, and 25 days after three years)</li><li>Five days of sick time each calendar year;</li><li>Six paid holidays yearly;</li><li>Periodic bonuses dependent upon company and employee performance; and</li><li>Participation in our flexible work time policies.</li></ul><p>We will perform background checks and request professional references from finalist candidates.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

    "content": "<h3>Humbly Confident Full Stack Developer</h3><div><p><strong><strong>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</strong></strong></p><p>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;, or read some of our&nbsp;, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in!&nbsp;We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;<em>click</em>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</p><p>But&nbsp;first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></strong></p><p>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.</p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s&nbsp;<em>external</em>&nbsp;competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.</p><p><strong><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named&nbsp;) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></strong></p><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></strong></p><p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done, a&nbsp;&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on&nbsp;. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong><strong>Up Your Game</strong></strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re International...</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;<em>and your family.</em>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;<em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;<em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>You will change lives.</em></p><p><strong><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</strong></strong></p><p>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).</p><p>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.</p><p>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).</p><p>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:</p><ul><li>“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”</li><li>“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd&nbsp;party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”</li><li>We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?</li><li>“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”</li></ul><p><strong><strong>You’re our person if you:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.</li><li>Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Integrating with 3rd&nbsp;party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.</li><li>Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.</li><li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.</li><li>Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.</li><li>Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.</li><li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.</li><li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.</li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p></p><ul><li>Apply below (<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>here</a>) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on&nbsp;<strong>June 30th, 2019</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Firm. It’s a real deadline.</li></ul><ul><li>First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:</li><li>You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</li><ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and&nbsp;<strong>why you would be a great fit for the position</strong>. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).</li><li>Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)</li><li>Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.</li><li>Includes answers to the following questions:</li><ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them?</li><li>Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position,&nbsp;what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>Complete this short coding test (<a href='https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb' rel='nofollow'>https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb</a>) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.</li></ul></ul></ul><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

    "content": "<h3>Ruby on Rails Developer</h3><div><div>Bonjour, Ruby on Rails + React Developers!</div><div><br></div><div>Here's the deal; before our clients hire us, they've often already invested a lot of time, energy, and money into having custom web applications developed to help them solve some business challenges. They come to us looking for a team to provide dependable support and maintenance of their existing Ruby on Rails (and a handful of React) projects. We do this in the form of recurring retainers where we take care of small feature updates, bug fixes, performance improvements, chipping away at their technical debt, and helping them experiment as they navigate their forward as a business.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What we rarely do? Is spin up brand new web applications for them. We learned years ago that there is rarely a long-term client relationship with startups (as they tend to flop in 1-2 years). So, we stopped competing on those projects.</div><div><br></div><div>The tradeoff? We get to build lasting partnerships with our clients and have some influence on how they're planning for their life of their web applications.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So...if you're the type of developer that really enjoys shiny and new things (and/or pitching entire app rewrites)... this probably isn't the position for you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you're the type of developer that enjoys jumping into the deep end of complex projects, helping iterate and improve software, likes to take on responsibility and be given opportunities to help lead projects... then we should talk.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Our Core Values</span></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span> PROACTIVE</span>&nbsp;- We actively seek opportunities to improve our client’s products, our processes, and our abilities.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span> CURIOUS</span>&nbsp;- A natural curiosity for the undiscovered results in remarkable work for our clients – and stronger connections for our team. We ask questions, learn, and aren't afraid to fail.</div><div><br></div><div><span> DEPENDABLE</span>&nbsp;- We are invested in our work. We manage expectations. We support our clients and teammates. We hold ourselves, our teammates, and our clients accountable.</div><div><br></div><div><span> VERSATILE</span>&nbsp;- We readily adapt to change and encourage innovation because our team and work are transparent and flexible.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<span>DELIGHTFUL</span>&nbsp;- We choose to set a mindful, positive tone that allows everyone to flourish.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a small team and wear many hats.

(But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;Google us, or read some of our&nbsp;reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.   <br>   <br>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.   <br>   <br>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our&nbsp;web app&nbsp;and&nbsp;API. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in!&nbsp;We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original&nbsp;Cultural Manifesto&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;click&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!   <br>   <br>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side&nbsp;really&nbsp;well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.   <br>   <br>But&nbsp;first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.   <br>   <br>Who you’d be working with:   <br>   <br>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.   <br>   <br>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s&nbsp;external&nbsp;competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.   <br>   <br>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.   <br>   <br>How You’ll Work at YNAB   <br>   <br>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named&nbsp;Fortune’s #2 Best Small Company to Work For) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:   <br>   <br>Live Where You Want   <br>   <br>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.   <br>   <br>No Crazy Hours   <br>   <br>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.   <br>   <br>Take Vacation (Seriously)   <br>   <br>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;minimum&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.   <br>   <br>The YNAB Retreat   <br>   <br>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done&nbsp;Costa Rica, a&nbsp;gigantic cabin&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on&nbsp;Laguna Beach. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.   <br>   <br>Up Your Game   <br>   <br>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.   <br>   <br>If You’re International...   <br>   <br>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.   <br>   <br>If You’re Stateside…   <br>   <br>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;and your family.&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)   <br>   <br>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;your retirement&nbsp;nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)   <br>   <br>Other Tidbits   <br>   <br>   <br>* Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)   <br>   <br>* The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.   <br>   <br>* We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.   <br>   <br>* We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;standing?) in front of a computer.   <br>   <br>* We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.   <br>   <br>* Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will change lives.   <br>   <br>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer   <br>   <br>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).   <br>   <br>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.   <br>   <br>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).   <br>   <br>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:   <br>   <br>   <br>* “How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”   <br>   <br>* “We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd&nbsp;party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”   <br>   <br>* We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?   <br>   <br>* “We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>You’re our person if you:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.   <br>   <br>* Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.   <br>   <br>* Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.   <br>   <br>* Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)   <br>   <br>* Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.   <br>   <br>* Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.   <br>   <br>* Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Integrating with 3rd&nbsp;party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.   <br>   <br>* Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.   <br>   <br>* Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.   <br>   <br>* Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.   <br>   <br>* Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.   <br>   <br>* Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.   <br>   <br>* Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for&nbsp;all&nbsp;employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.   <br>   <br>How to Apply   <br>   <br>   <br>* Apply below (here) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on&nbsp;June 30th, 2019.&nbsp;Firm. It’s a real deadline.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:   <br>   <br>* You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and&nbsp;why you would be a great fit for the position. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).   <br>   <br>* Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)   <br>   <br>* Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.   <br>   <br>* Includes answers to the following questions:   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them?   <br>   <br>* Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.   <br>   <br>* If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position,&nbsp;what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?   <br>   <br>* Complete this short coding test (https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We look forward to hearing from you!   <br>   <br>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!  </div> </div>",

(But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our&nbsp;<a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8' rel='nofollow'>reviews on the app store</a>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our&nbsp;<a href='https://app.youneedabudget.com/' rel='nofollow'>web app</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://api.youneedabudget.com/' rel='nofollow'>API</a>. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in!&nbsp;We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;Cultural Manifesto</a>&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;<em>click</em>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</p><p>But&nbsp;first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></strong></p><p>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.</p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s&nbsp;<em>external</em>&nbsp;competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.</p><p><strong><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named&nbsp;<a href='http://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune’s #2 Best Small Company to Work For</a>) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></strong></p><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></strong></p><p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;Costa Rica</a>, a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'>Laguna Beach</a>. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong><strong>Up Your Game</strong></strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re International...</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;<em>and your family.</em>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;<em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;<em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>You will change lives.</em></p><p><strong><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</strong></strong></p><p>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).</p><p>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.</p><p>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).</p><p>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:</p><ul><li>“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”</li><li>“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd&nbsp;party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”</li><li>We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?</li><li>“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”</li></ul><p><strong><strong>You’re our person if you:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.</li><li>Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Integrating with 3rd&nbsp;party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.</li><li>Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.</li><li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.</li><li>Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.</li><li>Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.</li><li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.</li><li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.</li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p><strong><strong>How to Apply</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Apply below (<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>here</a>) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on&nbsp;<strong>June 30th, 2019</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Firm. It’s a real deadline.</li></ul><ul><li>First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:</li><li>You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</li><ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and&nbsp;<strong>why you would be a great fit for the position</strong>. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).</li><li>Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)</li><li>Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.</li><li>Includes answers to the following questions:</li><ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them?</li><li>Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position,&nbsp;what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>Complete this short coding test (<a href='https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb' rel='nofollow'>https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb</a>) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.</li></ul></ul></ul><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Paid-for Health Insurance (your family too!)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Minimum (paid) vacation policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>3% automatic 401k contribution</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Amazing work-life balance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Paid sick days</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Live where you want - Remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Profit-based bonus</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We currently have over 290 clients based throughout the UK and Ireland. These clients are a mixture of Theatres, Arts, Festivals and speciality offerings such as Ice Skating and Christmas attractions. We are a consistently profitable company with a healthy year on year growth. The new features and abilities we are adding to Ticketsolve put us in an excellent place to deliver strong growth in the coming years.   <br>   <br># Introduction   <br>We are currently going through an exciting evolution of our platform. We are moving from a traditional RoR architecture to a modern &quot;single page application&quot;, exposing our application as a set of API's consumed by Ember to provide a rich interactive experience.   <br>   <br>We have migrated our customer-facing ticket selling application to Ember and our ticket scanning application to Ember, with great success. We are currently working on rebuilding the backend of our platform with the immediate focus been on our &quot;Point of Sale&quot;. We are now looking to add to our team to accelerate the creation and rollout of this change across the remainder of our platform. This covers the CRM, reporting/analytics and configurations aspects of our backend.   <br>   <br>Over the last few months, we have grown the front end, Ember team. We are now looking to expand our server team with new people to cover Ruby and Ruby on Rails server development. Ideally, this person will have RoR experience. In terms of experience, we are open to both junior and experienced developers - the main requirement is talent and enthusiasm.   <br>   <br># How we work   <br>We run a lightweight process that focuses on feature-based delivery on a weekly basis. Our coordination and communication are mostly through daily 'catch-up meetings' and use of appropriate tools such as Trello for backlog management, Slack for communication and Git(GitHub) for source control and feature deployment through PRs and Milestones.   <br>   <br>From a coding perspective, we place a strong emphasis on clean, minimal, well-refactored code backed up by a robust suite of automated tests. We make use of peer review for all design and development work.   <br>   <br>In general, we strive for an approach that empowers and trusts individuals to 'do the right thing', and as a team, we try and keep each other true to this.   <br>   <br># Remote working   <br>Our development team works as a remote team with members in Berlin, Malmö, Barcelona, Singapore and Taiwan. Our wider organisation has people based in United Kingdom and Dublin. Dublin is our headquarters and main office space - with core Support team and Sales and Marketing team.   <br>   <br>Remote working has become part of our company DNA.

We are moving from a traditional RoR architecture to a modern &quot;single page application&quot;, exposing our application as a set of API's consumed by Ember to provide a rich interactive experience.</div><div><br></div><div>We have migrated our customer-facing ticket selling application to Ember and our ticket scanning application to Ember, with great success. We are currently working on rebuilding the backend of our platform with the immediate focus been on our &quot;Point of Sale&quot;. We are now looking to add to our team to accelerate the creation and rollout of this change across the remainder of our platform. This covers the CRM, reporting/analytics and configurations aspects of our backend.</div><div><br></div><div>Over the last few months, we have grown the front end, Ember team. We are now looking to expand our server team with new people to cover Ruby and Ruby on Rails server development. Ideally, this person will have RoR experience. In terms of experience, we are open to both junior and experienced developers - the main requirement is talent and enthusiasm.</div><div><br></div><div><b># Skills &amp; Requirements</b></div><div>- 2+ years experience developing web applications</div><div>- Experience with programming Ruby/Rails required with the role focused on server development</div><div>- Understanding of front-end technologies: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, SASS, Ember preferred, but not required&nbsp;</div><div>- Experience with Chef and Terraform a bonus</div><div>- Strong programming skills with a focus on clean design, well-refactored code and automated testing&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>- Comfortable working as part of a remote team&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b># Technologies we use</b></div><div>- Ruby on Rails is our primary server framework evolving towards pure API server</div><div>- Ember is our primary front end development framework</div><div>- JSONAPI::Resources, http://jsonapi-resources.com/, is how we are building our API's</div><div>- MySQL / Redis / Elastic are our primary storage engines</div><div>- All our servers are Ubuntu based managed through CHEF</div><div>- Deployed on AWS using terraform for managing infrastructure</div><div>- GitHub for source code management and process support</div><div>- Travis for continuous integration</div><div><br></div><div><b># How we work</b></div><div>We run a lightweight process that focuses on feature-based delivery on a weekly basis. Our coordination and communication are mostly through daily 'catch-up meetings' and use of appropriate tools such as Trello for backlog management, Slack for communication and Git(GitHub) for source control and feature deployment through PRs and Milestones.</div><div><br></div><div>From a coding perspective, we place a strong emphasis on clean, minimal, well-refactored code backed up by a robust suite of automated tests. We make use of peer review for all design and development work.</div><div><br></div><div>In general, we strive for an approach that empowers and trusts individuals to 'do the right thing', and as a team, we try and keep each other true to this.</div><div><br></div><div><b># Remote working</b></div><div>Our development team works as a remote team with members in Berlin, Malmö, Barcelona, Singapore and Taiwan. Our wider organisation has people based in United Kingdom and Dublin. Dublin is our headquarters and main office space - with core Support team and Sales and Marketing team.</div><div><br></div><div>Remote working has become part of our company DNA. We believe that it offers a lot of advantages to both Ticketsolve and employees. This means that you should be comfortable working as part of a remote team. If this is new to you, don't worry, it was for us at the beginning as well.

Our experience is that European and Asian time zones are preferable, as it allows for collaboration at reasonable times.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b># Recruitment process</b></div><div>We are initially looking for resumes and portfolio examples of your work, e.g. GitHub repositories, blog articles, etc. If you do not have anything suitable, we can provide a problem piece to work together on. Please submit resumes to shanly@ticketsolve.com with the subject &quot;Job Application&quot;. Please note that due to the volume of applications we will not respond to all applications, but instead make contact when there is a potential fit.</div><div><br></div><div>From there, we filter down and do a series of remote interviews. These are usually 'work' focused, i.e. looking at code together, pair programming, for example. Our preference is for candidates to talk to as much of the team as possible so that we, team and candidate, can make the best decision possible. If appropriate and makes sense, we will also look at facilitating face to face meetings as well.</div><div><br></div><div>After this stage, we will be in a position to make a formal offer.</div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more Programming jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Roger.ai </span><br><span>Senior Frontend Engineer (React)</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>America &amp; Europe</span></a></li><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Aha!</span><br><span>senior ruby on rails software engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>North America</span></a></li><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Grafana Labs </span><br><span>Web Developer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>East Coast US or European timezone</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.   <br>   <br>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;build a business&nbsp;not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.   <br>   <br>See how our clients&nbsp;talk&nbsp;about&nbsp;our approach&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;recognition we've received&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;holiday gifts&nbsp;each year. Or, if you're a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;Seaworthy, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!   <br>   <br>A Day In The Life   <br>   <br>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;team&nbsp;week&nbsp;recaps&nbsp;and&nbsp;years in review&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!   <br>   <br>What Does Success Look Like?   <br>   <br>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.   <br>   <br>After this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;Welcome aboard!   <br>   <br>Ongoing Support   <br>   <br>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Individual quarterly goal progress   <br>   <br>* Project status / team issues / weekly retro   <br>   <br>* Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Quarterly and Annual Reviews   <br>   <br>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We're here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.   <br>   <br>Experience and Results At Every Level   <br>   <br>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019.

Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin.

We need your help to take us to the next level!</p><p><strong><strong>A Day In The Life</strong></strong></p><p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p><p><strong><strong>What Does Success Look Like?</strong></strong></p><p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p><p>After this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<strong><em>Welcome aboard!</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing Support</strong></p><p>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:</p><ul><li>Individual quarterly goal progress</li><li>Project status / team issues / weekly retro</li><li>Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire</li></ul><p><strong>Quarterly and Annual Reviews</strong></p><p>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months.

Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase.

    "content": "<h3>Humbly Confident Full Stack Developer</h3><div><p><strong>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</strong></p><p>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. , or , and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </p><p>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our  and . All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in! We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original  has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! </p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side really well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</p><p>But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </p><p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p><p>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. </p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. </p><p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Live Where You Want</strong>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done , a  in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on . We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong>If You’re International...</strong>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. </p><p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. You will change lives. </p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</strong> </p><p>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).</p><p>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.</p><p>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).</p><p>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:</p><ul><li>“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”</li><li>“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”</li><li>We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?</li><li>“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”</li></ul><p><strong>You’re our person if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.</li><li>Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).</li></ul><p><strong>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:</strong></p><ul><li>Integrating with 3rd party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.</li><li>Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.</li><li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.</li><li>Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.</li><li>Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.</li><li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.</li><li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.</li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p> </p><ul><li>Apply <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>here</a> by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on <strong>June 30th, 2019</strong>. Firm. It’s a real deadline.</li><li>First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:</li><li>You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</li><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and <strong>why you would be a great fit for the position</strong>. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).</li><li>Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)</li><li>Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.</li><li>Includes answers to the following questions:</li><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them? </li><li>Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>Complete this short coding test (https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.</li></ul><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>P.S. If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

    "content": "**About Us and Why We’re Hiring**We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. [Google us](https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab), or [read some of our reviews on the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8), and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our [web app](https://app.youneedabudget.com/users/authentication) and [API](https://api.youneedabudget.com/). All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in! We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original [Cultural Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit) has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side really well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. **Who you’d be working with:**Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. **How You’ll Work at YNAB**We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:**Live Where You Want**We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.**No Crazy Hours**We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.**Take Vacation (Seriously)**We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.**The YNAB Retreat**We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done [Costa Rica](https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343), a [gigantic cabin](https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/) in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on [Laguna Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be). We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.**Up Your Game**We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.**If You’re International...**You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. **If You’re Stateside…**You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)**Other Tidbits**- Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) - The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. - We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.- We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.- We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.- Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.  You will change lives. **Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer** You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:- “How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”- “We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”- We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?- “We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”**You’re our person if you:**- Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.- Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.- Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.- Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)- Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.- Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.- Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).**Some things you might be working on at YNAB:**- Integrating with 3rd party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.- Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.- Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.- Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.- Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.- Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.- Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.**How to Apply** - Apply [here](https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on **June 30th, 2019**. Firm. It’s a real deadline.- First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:- You DO need a cover letter.

    "content": "<h2> Humbly Confident Full Stack Developer </h2><div><div><span><h2><span>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</span></h2></span></div><div><span>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a><span>, or read some of our </span><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8' rel='nofollow'><span>reviews on the app store</span></a><span>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our </span><a href='https://app.youneedabudget.com' rel='nofollow'><span>web app</span></a><span> and </span><a href='https://api.youneedabudget.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>API</span></a><span>. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in! </span><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original&nbsp;</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'><span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span>&nbsp;(</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit' rel='nofollow'>https://bit.ly/2DAv83H</a>) has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</div><div><br></div><div><span>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side </span><em>really</em><span> well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>But </span><span>first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h2>Who you'd be working with:</h2></div><div><span>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s </span><em>external</em><span> competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h2>How You'll Work at YNAB</h2></div><div><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Live Where You Want</span></h4></div><div><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h4></div><div><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h4></div><div><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span><em>minimum</em><span> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>The YNAB Retreat</span></h4></div><div><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a><span>, a </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a><span> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on </span><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'><span>Laguna Beach</span></a><span>. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Up Your Game</span></h4></div><div><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>If You’re International...</span></h4></div><div><span>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h4></div><div><span>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span><em>and your family.</em><span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span><em>your retirement</em><span></span><em>nest egg</em><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Other Tidbits</span></h4></div><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span><br></li><li><span>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span><br></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span><br></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span><br></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span><br></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</span><br><br></li></ul><div><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>You will change lives. </em></div><div><br></div><div><h2>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</h2></div><div><span>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites).

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that’s a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.</p><p>Because we’re more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;<em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.</p><p>See how our clients&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we’ve received</a>&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/holiday-collaboration-with-velodrome-coffee/' rel='nofollow'>holiday gifts</a>&nbsp;each year. Or, if you’re a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/seaworthy/' rel='nofollow'>Seaworthy</a>, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We’re excited about what we’ve achieved in the last few years, but we’re just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!</p><h3><span>A Day In The Life</span></h3><p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p><h3><span>What Does Success Look Like?</span></h3><p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you’ll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several “Headway 101” sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you’re new to one of our tech stacks, we’ll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p><p>You’ll have dedicated pairing time scheduled with various colleagues to cover different skills, and we’ll even participate in several mock client meetings so your first standup or sprint planning meeting doesn’t carry with it the weight of your first client interaction. After this training period, you’ll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You’ll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<span><em>Welcome aboard!</em></span></p><p><span>Ongoing Support</span></p><p>Each week, you’ll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:</p><ul><li>Individual quarterly goal progress</li><li>Project status / team issues / weekly retro</li><li>Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire</li></ul><p><span>Quarterly and Annual Reviews</span></p><p>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We’re here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.</p><h3><span>Experience and Results At Every Level</span></h3><p>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019.

For example, we use web-stack technologies like Typescript and Sass for UI development; Python and Rust for natural language processing, Go for providing high-performance backend services; and Ruby for building complex server-side applications.<br /><br />You will be responsible for significant portions of the software for the projects you are assigned to and will own your projects from conception, through design and implementation, to support.<br /><br />You will work closely with the rest of the development team to make sure that we are delivering well engineered solutions, and will help the production team initiate mass manufacturing on the results.<br /><br />From time you time, you may be required to help in the following other areas:<br /><br />*Demo development and testing*<br />Mentoring and assisting with supervision of interns<br />Attending trade shows and conferences<br />Example projects<br />We’ll be expecting you to work on a variety of different projects to support the goals above.

You’ll receive a market-rate salary and your choice of equipment, as well as an annual training and conference budget. We use loads of open-source software, and we’d love for you to contribute to projects while you are here – and you’re welcome to take some time for personal projects too.",

    "content": "10flats is a search algorithm that seeks to disrupt the way people search for real estate. We all have rented apartments and know how frustrating and time-consuming it might be scrolling through hundreds of posts trying the find some real gems. The biggest problem is the listing portal itself. The way they monetize their business models involves tons of listings. The more posts there are, the more money they make. Easy. The problem, however, is that no user is interested in the endless scrolling of hundreds of places – (s)he is interested in finding THE place.<br /><br />This is where 10flats kicks in. A typical client normally visits about 10 properties before moving in. So what stops other listing portals from limiting search result to 10 at max? The answer is – their poor algorithms. The portals simply cannot capture the entire decision-making process, and thus they stick to what's simple and easy. They use the unit (apartment or house) as the key driver in search, i.e. size, bedrooms, bathrooms, furnished, home appliances, windows face south, etc. However, when a person moves in, (s)he surprisingly finds out that the nearest grocery store is 3 blocks away, the closest gym is 30 minutes bus distance, the only school in the neighborhood happens to be senior and not primary. These are the drivers of the ecosystem that create and support our lifestyle. They are never accounted for by search algorithms.<br /><br />10flats uses an extended search algorithm to find those missing bits of lifestyle. What is the benefit for the user? 10flat within 60 seconds can return 10 curated listings that match your living criteria 90% and more. No more times wasted scrolling, no more time wasted researching neighborhoods, no more visits to mismatched apartments. Stop scrolling, start living.<br /><br />10flats is looking for another team member, an enthusiasts web developer who would support the algorithm on the client side in our journey to disrupt the real estate search. This position is not salaried but with a substantial part of equity upon incorporation. Please also note that we are looking to start in DACH so the role better have a good command of German, besides English or Russian.",

With our technology, they are able to spend less time on registering, planning, reporting, and drawing up care plans, allowing them to devote more time to their patients. The family can also be informed immediately about the patient’s wellbeing at the touch of a button.   <br>   <br>You will work on developing new functionalities and supporting the existing functionalities. Together with the team you determine how these functionalities are developed and what they will look like. In addition to your own development work, you review the work of teammates, you will work with other teams within Healthcare group and can pilot functionalities at customers and users.   <br>   <br>Nedap Healthcare consists of a number of passionate developers and support staff who all strive to create a well- and beautifully-designed product. The challenges include not only supporting users, but also healthcare organizations and other parties that provide medical information for our clients.   <br>   <br>The majority of our work is done from our green, pleasant and open office in Groenlo. We have great coffee and a splendid restaurant where you can have lunch. But ultimately you decide how you are going about the work. From home, in the ‘office’, in a co-working space, you name it. We do not expect you to apply structural work times, but we do expect you to deliver quality. This way you can relax and enjoy life by the time you go home. In other words, manage your own capacity.   <br>   <br>Required experience and skills as Ruby on Rails Developer&nbsp;   <br>Because our products continues to grow and the healthcare world continues to change, we are looking for experienced Ruby on Rails developers who want to contribute to our team and product with passion.   <br>   <br>Our teams have been using Rails since some of the earliest releases and are comprised of people with 10+ years experience as well as people who are just getting started. Nedap Healthcare has multiple small and large Rails applications in production, serving millions of requests each day.   <br>   <br>Do you have five or more years of experience in Rails, both in deployment and development? We are hoping to find someone who is both technically capable and who is an excellent communicator who has no trouble discussing complex topics in English both orally and through the written word.   <br>   <br>And now?   <br>Have you become excited? Please send your motivation and CV via the application button for the attention of Michelle Ketting Olivier. For more information you can send her an email (   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span>). An assessment will be part of the selection procedure.   <br>   <br>As part of the application procedure we may ask for a Certificate of Good Behaviour.  </div> </div>",

Transportation technology is a hot market and we’re leading the charge, with raving fans and new customers signing up every day. We're looking for an experienced, driven, product-focused Senior Rails Engineer to help us deliver amazing features to our customers.   <br>   <br>   <br>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING   <br>   <br>Your work will be heavily focused toward high level, high impact areas. You’ll work closely with Product Managers and Designers to plan, design, and implement some of our more complex features. You’ll have a strong voice in the development and planning processes, so prior senior-level experience is key.   <br>   <br>We work in weekly sprints and use Pivotal Tracker to keep things organized. While we keep meetings to a minimum, our remote team is heavily collaborative and takes advantage of modern tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Zoom to stay in touch.   <br>   <br>Our stack includes Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Postgres and Heroku. We’re currently on Rails 5.1 and strive to keep our frameworks and libraries up to date.   <br>   <br>This is a position we consider essential to the company’s success. Be sure to mention coffee in your application so we know you actually read this.   <br>   <br>   <br>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU   <br>   <br>   <br>* Be a part of an incredible team of “A” players who go above and beyond to make Fleetio a successful company. We’re a customer-centric team with a great product, excellent support, and countless happy customers.   <br>   <br>* Work from our HQ in Birmingham, AL or remotely. 50% of our Engineering Team works remotely and we strive to promote a strong remote working culture.   <br>   <br>* Build software used by people all around the world. So many different types of companies and organizations operate a fleet each day, and Fleetio is a good fit for most of them (it’s a huge market).   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>OUR TEAM   <br>   <br>We're hardcore believers in easy-to-use software. Crafting a delightful user experience is hard work, but we welcome the challenge and are looking for team members who share our ambition.   <br>   <br>We’re a startup that’s in “scale up” mode, meaning we’re past the days of just a couple of people in a small office, but we’re still very much a fast-paced, highly collaborative company.   <br>   <br>Our top goal as product engineers is adding value to our customers and we love to get changes out quickly. We've optimized our CI/CD to make it painless to run our test suite and get code into our production Heroku environments easily, resulting in an average of 40 deploys per week.   <br>   <br>We place great value on work/life balance and abhor the stereotypical 100 hours/week startup life. We have families and know you do, too.

Every single person is key to a project and by having everyone involved&nbsp;learn the required topics we make sure that no one feels out of place.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>10 days of paid leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Fully remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible work schedules</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We love new technologies and innovation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Internal growth oportunities</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.</p><p>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;<em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.</p><p>See how our clients&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we've received</a>&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/holiday-collaboration-with-velodrome-coffee/' rel='nofollow'>holiday gifts</a>&nbsp;each year. Or, if you're a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/seaworthy/' rel='nofollow'>Seaworthy</a>, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!</p><p><strong><strong>A Day In The Life</strong></strong></p><p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p><p><strong><strong>What Does Success Look Like?</strong></strong></p><p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p><p>You'll have dedicated pairing time scheduled with various colleagues to cover different skills, and we'll even participate in several mock client meetings so your first standup or sprint planning meeting doesn't carry with it the weight of your first client interaction.

Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, a year ago I moved Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.</p><p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. To give you an idea, here's our South African website: <a href='https://www.simplepay.co.za' rel='nofollow'>https://www.simplepay.co.za</a></p><p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.</p><p>The work will include: Doing direct integrations with other systems (hopefully banks too, eventually). Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Improving security. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).</p><p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire senior developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.</p><p>Location: GMT+1 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)</p><p>Please mail <a href='mailto:developers+so@simplepay.cloud' rel='nofollow'>developers+so@simplepay.cloud</a> - don't use the built-in submission functionality here. Please include a link to a specific open source contribution or an issue you logged (no matter how tiny or long ago) in the body of your email. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/250148?reset=False&amp;ra=1lTiocr98JP2&amp;oqs=a%3D1lTiocr98JP2' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About SimplePay</h3>            <div><p>SimplePay is a developer owned company providing online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore.

    "content": "<h2> Rails Developer </h2><div><div>BookingSync is more than a vacation rental solution for hosts and agencies; it is a platform for hundreds of applications and developers. We need an excellent engineer to take on the challenges of developing integration with multiple APIs from our partners, beautifully designed micro/macro-services, modeling complex domain and doing all that following TDD and writing a code of excellent quality.</div><div><br></div><div>We are growing fast and so are our requirements for scalability and stability. We are no longer at a scale where adding X number of servers solves all the issues. Database sharding, replicating data via message queues/distributed streams, optimizing response times in APIs to the max, integration with multiple services coming from our own ecosystem and numerous third-party services, and very soon dealing with big data - those are the things you can surely expect to be challenged by.</div><div><br></div><div>We are also a fully-remote async/distributed company across the entire world without a physical office. If traveling is your passion and you highly value location-independence, BookingSync is the right place for you.</div><div><br></div><div><b>2200€ - 4500€ + VAT / month on B2B contract + equity (real shares, not stock options)</b></div><div><br></div><div><strong>You will need to have:</strong></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Strong experience with Ruby on Rails</li><li>Proficiency in backend development in general</li><li>Solid design and architecture skills</li><li>Ability to demonstrate that with the right approach Rails can scale easily</li><li>Ability to communicate effectively with both internal and external development teams</li><li>Experience with relational databases and SQL (we're on Postgres). Experience with other databases will be a plus</li><li>A strong commitment to quality</li><li>Excellent written and spoken English</li><li>Experience with remote work and/or a solid work ethic that makes it possible to thrive in a remote-only environment</li><li>Care for the greater good, BookingSync is not just a software company, we give back to humanitarian, solidarity, environmental &amp; ecological causes from 10% to 50% of our profit.</li></ul><div><strong>It would be great if you had experience with:</strong></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Messaging solutions (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)</li><li>DDD/CQRS/ES, Clean Architecture</li><li>Contributing to development community through code, documentation, mentoring, teaching, speaking and all other forms</li><li>Short terms rentals or travel industry</li></ul><div><strong>Sounds interesting? Contact us now!</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Want to increase your chances of standing out? Include your open source contributions, blog posts and other publications you wrote, links to conference talks. You could even tell us about one thing or two you created that you are particularly proud of or the most challenging features you've worked on.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The hiring process consists of four steps:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>1. A small homework: Imagine that you don't want to or just don't have enough time to go through entire Twitter, LinkedIn or Youtube feeds manually every day and you just want to have a quick way of getting the content under a given hashtag. Implement a Rails application where you can provide a list of hashtags in the input and as the result, a feed aggregating the content from Twitter, LinkedIn and Youtube feeds under these hashtags will be displayed (including headlines, videos, descriptions and whatever else that could be useful). Make the design flexible enough that would make it easy to add more sources in the future. Treat it as a real-world application (not just a prototype or a proof of concept) and send us a link to the repo.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Technical interview with remote pair-programming session with CTO: the interview part shouldn't take too much time - we are mostly interested in ability to solve the actual problems and being able to figure out the best possible solution for that problem, not in knowing things can be easily googled and learned through experience, that's why the interview part will be focused mostly on open-ended questions about some non-trivial matters. The pair-programming session will take a bit longer, and it will involve some nice challenge in a Rails universe.</div><div><br></div><div>3. An interview with our CEO and/or COO that will be focused more on soft things, nothing technical this time.</div><div><br></div><div>4. An opportunity to have the conversation with the entire team you are going to work with. It is an excellent way for both sides to make sure we will be a perfect mutual match.</div><div><br></div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more Programming jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Retail Zipline</span><br><span>Senior Rails Backend Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>U.S.A or Canada</span></a></li><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>G2i Inc.</span><br><span>Remote Contract React Native Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Contract</span><span>/</span><span>North and South America</span></a></li><li><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>G2i inc</span><br><span>Remote Contract React Native Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Contract</span><span>/</span><span>North America</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

Transportation technology is a hot market and we’re leading the charge, with raving fans and new customers signing up every day. We're looking for an experienced, driven, product-focused Senior Rails Engineer to help us deliver amazing features to our customers.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><b>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Your work will be heavily focused toward high level, high impact areas. You’ll work closely with Product Managers and Designers to plan, design, and implement some of our more complex features. You’ll have a strong voice in the development and planning processes, so prior senior level experience is key.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We work in weekly sprints and use Pivotal Tracker to keep things organized. While we keep meetings to a minimum, our remote team is heavily collaborative and takes advantage of modern tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Zoom to stay in touch.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our stack includes Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Postgres and Heroku. We’re currently on Rails 5.1 and strive to keep our frameworks and libraries up to date.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>This is a position we consider essential to the company’s success. Be sure to mention coffee in your application so we know you actually read this.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><b>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><span></span>Be a part of an incredible team of “A” players who go above and beyond to make Fleetio a successful company.

Crafting a delightful user experience is hard work, but we welcome the challenge and are looking for team members who share our ambition.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We’re a startup that’s in “scale up” mode, meaning we’re past the days of just a couple of people in a small office, but we’re still very much a fast-paced, highly collaborative company.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our top goal as product engineers is adding value to our customers and we love to get changes out quickly. We've optimized our CI/CD to make it painless to run our test suite and get code into our production Heroku environments easily, resulting in an average of 40 deploys per week.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We place great value on work/life balance and abhor the stereotypical 100 hour/week startup life.

Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most discussed perk is our offshore where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we went to Uruguay, do you want to join?</span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><span>About You</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Whether you’re building features like calendar integrations, importing credit card transactions, or pulling information from receipts, you’re self-driven and collaborative.

So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:<br></div><ol><li>What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?<br></li><li>What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?<br></li><li>What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?<br></li><li>How did you hear about us?

That is why we talk about technology that matters. The key focus in this is not the technology, but the way in which it is used on a day-to-day basis. The distinctive aspect of the solutions of Nedap is that new technologies are processed in a creative and innovative way into elegant, user-friendly products.<br><br>In addition to detailed knowledge of technological developments, Nedap also has a deep insight into various market segments. Nedap has different business units, so called market groups, each of which focuses on its own market. Each market group is responsible not just for the development of its products, but also for their marketing and sales.<br><br>Because each business unit functions as an independent enterprise, this results in balanced combinations of technology, products and businesses targeted at a specific market. By making smart use of the knowledge and experience of other market groups, products are developed and launched on the market more quickly; this is a major reason for our competitive strength<br><br>Nedap offers its employees the opportunity to be entrepreneurs in technology that matters.

We focus on a) providing a great product b) listening very closely to our customer needs and c) adding features where there's proven demand. Everything we do is tracked back to KPIs that matter to us and our customers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For some people this is a really scary way to run a company as there's nowhere to hide. For us it's the only way to operate, but that's not to say we've not got it wrong in the past (adding features people don't need is one of several examples).</div><div><br></div><div><b>A bit about you</b></div><div><br></div><div>We're looking to take on a developer so we can speed up the rate at which we move. Key skills for this role are:</div><ul><li>Senior level Rails experience</li><li>jQuery, Sysadmin or UI/UX skills a bonus</li><li>Strong ownership skills. As a small team we don't have project managers. You're responsible for your tasks so you'll need to be good at taking ownership and reporting back to the team.</li><li>Flexibility and an open mind. Everyone in the company does customer support two days per month. You learn an incredible amount about our customers and our product doing this, which is why we insist on it. It doesn't matter if you've no experience doing customer support. We're happy to train you up and there'll be somebody with you when you're on duty.</li><li>An ability to renegotiate requirements. In Computer Science there's hard problems and hard problems that don't need solving. We are constantly asking ourselves if there's an easier way to do something for our customers. Knowing when a hard problem doesn't need solving and throwing the requirements back is essential for us.</li></ul><div><br></div><div> <b>A bit about what we can offer</b><br></div><div> </div><ul><li>Properly flexible working. We all work remote by default and meet up as required. As long as the work gets done and you overlap with your colleagues for part the day then we don't mind when you work.<br> </li><li>A sensible work life balance. We work 7.5 hours a day. That gives you a chance to do what you love outside of work, which means you'll come back the next day refreshed and effective. We do occasionally get caught up in the excitement of a new feature launch and work more, but it is just that – occasional. A culture of long hours benefits nobody.</li><li>The odd owl-themed night out or away day</li></ul><p></p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

We know how it is.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> Which is why we’ll try to sell ourselves to you here.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <i>Ahum. Here it comes.</i><br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <h3><b>What makes the dev team at Silverfin special?</b></h3> First of all, we build a hell of a product and our customers love us. Even our customers’ customers love us. Silverfin solves a very real problem: it automates a large chunk of the repetitive tasks that people working in financial services spend their time on, and improves communication with their customers.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 3TB in size*, and our largest table recently crossed the 8 billion row mark. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> We’re a remote-first engineering team with offices in Ghent, London and Copenhagen which you can visit if you’d like. Still, most of us work remotely, even those who are local. We’re based all over Europe, and without Slack we’d be lonely, now we just zap in and out of the zone as we wish. Or not: we encourage judicious use of the DnD function, and recommend async communication over disturbing synchronous pings.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> We’d be really happy to welcome you in our dev channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other IRL too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company to not become too siloed.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <h3><b>What does working at Silverfin look like?</b></h3> We work in small, focused teams of around 5 people, each team taking ownership of a part of the application. When developing new features, the team is responsible for both the backend as well as the frontend part.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> You’ll be supported by our crazy good UI designer who writes HTML and CSS components into a reusable UI-kit, and even builds Vue prototypes where necessary, handling compatibility problems with different browsers for you, and making sure everything is responsive too.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> On the other side of the spectrum is our genius ops team who keeps things running smoothly, making sure deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> Our stack is Vue.js and vanilla JS with a sprinkling of jQuery on the frontend and an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend. We use PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. We use GitLab, Quip and Slack for everyday tasks and Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice. No code gets deployed without a thorough code-review by a peer, testing is a must, our sprints are called cycles and last 3 weeks, and sometimes we even finish everything that we committed to in time.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <h3><b>What are we looking for?</b></h3> We’re looking for somebody who’s <i>really great</i> at developing in Ruby and Ruby on Rails.<br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> <br></div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><div> </div><ul><li>You need to be experienced in both Ruby <i>and</i> Rails, and also know where the boundaries lie between them.

Our technology team provide the tools and know-how to sustain and magnify that growth.</p><p>We need a back-end developer to hone our fulfillment, analytics and data warehousing systems so we can continually improve the awesomeness of our customer experience. We’re transitioning to a headless e-commerce architecture to make our systems more maintainable, flexible and robust, and we’d like your help. You will play a key role in determining how Bellroy’s technical stack looks like in the future.</p><p>At some companies we observe a familiar and depressing pattern: the most technically excellent developers hit a ceiling beyond which they can’t progress unless they start taking on direct “reports”, and becoming “managers”. Given no other options they launch themselves down this path. As they progress they spend less and less time doing the thing that they love (crafting excellent code) while they learn a completely different craft — management — and spend more and more time dealing with people and their problems. At Bellroy we love the people who want to make that transition, but we don’t think that it should be the only way to progress your career, and we make sure that we have a technical stream that allows people to keep getting better at programming.</p><p>You will initially work closely with our marketplace, logistics and data teams. You will grow an innovative yet stable platform and make critical decisions about where to use third party solutions and where to build our own. In the medium term, you will gain experience building and honing systems across all parts of our business. So, if you have strong technical skills, a growth mindset and the ability to get shit done, then this could be the job for you.</p><p>Historically, we built most of our web applications in Ruby on Rails with PostgreSQL and Redis backends, so you must have at least a working understanding of that technology stack. But – we’re re-assessing our technical stack, so you will have opportunities to learn and master new programming languages and frameworks (we’re excited about, but not committed to, Haskell, Go and Rust, among others). We use the dry-rb family of gems to keep our Rails applications nice and clean.</p><p>A quick note: We’re currently advertising a number of roles, so if this one doesn’t quite tick all of your boxes, check out our Senior Technical Lead and Senior Team Lead roles, and if the job you really wish we were advertising is some combination of the advertised roles, apply anyway. As part of your application tell us what you’re really looking for.</p><p><strong>YOU COULD BE THE ONE, IF YOU…</strong></p><ul><li>Have a solid technical background in Ruby on Rails, but recognise that it has limitations</li><li>Have a passion for understanding non-technical parts of the business and how they can leverage technology to boost their efficiency</li><li>Consistently deliver high quality code with strong, well-researched design principles</li><li>Want to have a voice in technology selection and architecture</li><li>Get excited about great books and the ideas you can steal from them – technical and non-technical books alike</li><li>Think a workplace with dogs, coffee, breakout spaces and casual dresscode sounds like a great place to be; or prefer working from wherever you are (yes, that’s right, this role is open to remote folk too)</li><li>Want to work for a company that cares about doing good things for the world</li></ul><p><strong>YOU PROBABLY AREN’T THE ONE, IF YOU…</strong></p><ul><li>Want to be delivered a list of software requirements, and never have to have a conversation with a ‘non-techie’</li><li>Work just to pay the bills, no matter who is paying you</li></ul><p><strong>WHY WORK FOR BELLROY?</strong></p><p>We have carefully built our culture on radical effectiveness. Our credo is “smart people with good intentions who get shit done” (yes, really). We have an awesome workplace in the heart of Fitzroy with free snacks and coffee (and a smaller workspace in Bells Beach).</p><p>Bellroy’s mission is to inspire better ways to carry; use business as a force for good; and help the world – and our crew – flourish. We make great carry products that delight people in their everyday lives. We help our staff love their work and grow as people. We donate a portion of our revenue to some of the world’s most effective charities. We are constantly looking for better ways to do… well, everything. Want to help us?</p><p><strong>LOCATION AND HOURS</strong></p><p><strong>This can be a full-time role located in our Fitzroy office, or a full-time remote position from anywhere in the world.

We know how it is.<br></div><div></div><div> Which is why we’ll try to sell ourselves to you here.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><i>Ahum. Here it comes.</i><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><h3><b>What makes the dev team at Silverfin special?</b></h3> First of all, we build a hell of a product and our customers love us. Even our customers’ customers love us. Silverfin solves a very real problem: it automates a large chunk of the repetitive tasks that people working in financial services spend their time on, and improves communication with their customers.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div> To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 3TB in size*, and our largest table recently crossed the 8 billion row mark. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div> We’re a remote-first engineering team with offices in Ghent, London and Copenhagen which you can visit if you’d like. Still, most of us work remotely, even those who are local. We’re based all over Europe, and without Slack we’d be lonely, now we just zap in and out of the zone as we wish. Or not: we encourage judicious use of the DnD function, and recommend async communication over disturbing synchronous pings.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div> We’d be really happy to welcome you in our <a href='https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23dev' rel='nofollow'>#dev</a> channel, but it’s not just virtual: we make sure we regularly get to see each other IRL too. Twice a year we fly the whole engineering team together to a different location in Europe, and at least once a year we join up with the rest of the company to not become too siloed.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><h3><b>What does working at Silverfin look like?</b></h3> We work in small, focused teams of around 5 people, each team taking ownership of a part of the application. When developing new features, the team is responsible for both the backend as well as the frontend part.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div> You’ll be supported by our crazy good UI designer who writes HTML and CSS components into a reusable UI-kit, and even builds Vue prototypes where necessary, handling compatibility problems with different browsers for you, and making sure everything is responsive too.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div> On the other side of the spectrum is our genius ops team who keeps things running smoothly, making sure deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div> Our stack is Vue.js and vanilla JS with a sprinkling of jQuery on the frontend and an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend. We use PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. We use GitLab, Quip and Slack for everyday tasks and Zoom as our remote conferencing tool of choice. No code gets deployed without a thorough code-review by a peer, testing is a must, our sprints are called cycles and last 3 weeks, and sometimes we even finish everything that we committed to in time.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><h3><b>What are we looking for?</b></h3> We’re looking for somebody who’s <i>really great</i> at developing in Ruby and Ruby on Rails.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li>You need to be experienced in both Ruby <i>and</i> Rails, and also know where the boundaries lie between them. You need to be able to code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels.</li><li>You enjoy mentoring juniors and giving in-depth feedback during code reviews. While you appreciate the small stuff, you recognize bikeshedding and can avoid its pitfalls.</li><li>You code with reason and can justify the important decisions you made during development.</li><li>You know and apply best practices. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also good object oriented design, SRP, SOLID, ... </li><li>You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping all stakeholders of the project in mind.</li><li>You’ve got opinions on code design and you can defend them, but you’re professional enough to not let those opinions get in the way of a consensus if necessary.</li><li>You have good knowledge and foresight of potential performance issues that might arise when working with large datasets.</li></ul><div><br></div><div></div><div><h3><b>What we offer</b></h3></div><ul><li>Actual, proper work-life balance</li><li>Become a part of a fully remote development team with over 20 engineers</li><li>Free to choose your own schedule and work 100% remotely</li><li>A stimulating work environment with passionate, friendly and inclusive colleagues who value diversity</li><li>Team retreats twice a year</li><li>A €1000 yearly budget to spend on conferences, courses, workshops or other expenses that will improve your skills</li></ul><div><h3><b>Requirements</b></h3></div><ul><li>You have at least 4 years of experience working with Ruby, or 2 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in other languages.</li><li>You grok Rails</li><li>Your work hours overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)</li></ul><div><h3><b>Good to have</b></h3></div><ul><li>Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team</li><li>Experience with Javascript (ES6) and frontend frameworks</li><li>Experience in Fintech</li><li>Accounting knowledge</li></ul><div><br></div><div></div><div> *:<i> Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re indexing all the things, but it still sounds impressive, right?</i><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div></div>",

We are hosted on Heroku so the typical infrastructure you would expect. On the front end, we don't have yet the complexity that demands a framework like React / Elm the likes, vanilla JS is all that we need at the moment.<br /><br />We are an exciting and very well funded early stage Fintech startup (£2M). We help business vendors get paid upfront and offer their customers monthly finance on their invoices. Instead of late payments and inflexible terms, we help both vendors and their business customers manage their cashflow better. Our vision is to become the leading finance provider for business transactions<br /><br />You will be able to contribute massively to the overall architecture and direction. We are at an exciting stage in our journey.

As a team we will make sure you are not missing out by pushing remote first practices.<br />* Flexibility to adjust your daily hours. Visiting friends and family in another country, going to the bank or the gym, you only need to have an overlap between our core hours (12am - 4pm) for 6 hours. As an example, you can start at 8am and finish at 4pm or 12am and finish at 8pm.<br />* Great equity in the business<br /><br />How we work<br />--------------<br />*Backlog-less Fridays*: Fridays are reserved for purely technical work that we define as part of our iteration. That may include tooling to make our lives easier, experiments for performance optimisation or contributing to open source projects.<br /><br />*Asynchronously*: We might not be a fully remote company but we are striving for remote first principles. We use tools such as Slack only for watercooler conversation and 1-1 interaction. Anything that requires thinking, time to process and a number of people, we move it to email so that everyone can participate in their own time and communicate their thoughts.<br /><br />_Note: You need to be able to work in the U.K. We can only offer remote work within the U.K._<br /><br />_Note: The salary is for a Senior role.

Our Senior Technology Lead will help us use the programming languages we work in every day as they&nbsp;should&nbsp;be used, not as they&nbsp;can&nbsp;be used. Yes, to ship features (we’re not a language research lab and we’re not afraid of a slightly inelegant hack that gets the job done without polluting the codebase) but to be able to look back and see that we used the right abstractions, that our architecture served our business needs, that we didn’t brute force what we could have finessed. To achieve this end we need someone to manage our technical review process and shepherd our code quality within one of our four-person development teams. And, be jointly responsible for the enterprise architecture strategy of the whole technology team.</div><div><br></div><div>At some companies we observe a familiar and depressing pattern: the most technically excellent developers hit a ceiling beyond which they can’t progress unless they start taking on direct “reports”, and becoming “managers”. Given no other options they launch themselves down this path. As they progress they spend less and less time doing the thing that they love (crafting excellent code) while they learn a completely different craft — management — and spend more and more time dealing with people and their problems. At Bellroy we love the people who want to make that transition, but we don’t think that it should be the only way to progress your career, and we make sure that we have a technical stream that allows people to keep getting better at programming. This is a role in that technical stream.</div><div><br></div><div>The majority of our current codebases are in pure Ruby or Ruby on Rails, so you must have at least a working understanding of these technologies. We use React and Elm in the front-end, and we’re starting to move more toward the latter. We're striving for a headless e-commerce model and re-assessing our technical stack. You will have opportunities to learn and master new programming languages and frameworks (we’re excited about Haskell, Go and Rust, among others).</div><div><br></div><div>A quick note: We’re currently advertising a number of roles, so if this one doesn’t quite tick all of your boxes, check out our&nbsp;<a href='https://bellroy.com/careers/senior-team-lead-technology' rel='nofollow'>Senior Team Lead</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://bellroy.com/careers/back-end-developer' rel='nofollow'>Back-end Developer</a>&nbsp;roles. If your ideal job is some combination of the advertised roles, apply anyway. As part of your application, tell us what you’re really looking for.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h3><strong>YOU COULD BE THE ONE, IF…</strong></h3></div><ul><li>Have a solid technical background in Ruby on Rails, but recognise that it has limitations</li><li>Consistently deliver high quality code with strong, well-researched design principles</li><li>Want a key role in technology selection and architecture, and don’t see people management as the right way to progress in your career</li><li>Care more about tabs vs spaces than Scrum vs Kanban</li><li>Get excited about great books and the ideas you can steal from them – technical and non-technical books alike</li><li>Think a workplace with dogs, coffee, breakout spaces and casual dresscode sounds like a great place to be</li><li>Want to work for a company that cares about doing good things for the world</li></ul><div><br></div><div><h3><strong>LOCATION AND HOURS</strong></h3></div><div>This can be a full-time role located in our Fitzroy office, or a full-time remote position from anywhere in the world.
