Recognized for its consistent cooperation and collaboration with cities, Spin partners closely with transportation planners, elected officials, community groups, and university administrators to bring stationless mobility options to streets in a responsible and carefully orchestrated manner.</p><p>Based in San Francisco, Spin is a diverse team of engineers, designers, urban planners, policymakers, lawyers and operators with experience from Y Combinator, Lyft, Uber, local and federal government, and the transportation advocacy world. Spin was known for launching the first stationless mobility program in Seattle, and has since expanded to become the exclusive electric scooter partner in mid-sized cities like Coral Gables, Florida and Lexington, Kentucky, and one of a few permitted scooter operators in large cities like Denver, Detroit, and Washington, D.C. The team embeds in cities and neighborhoods to understand their specific transportation needs, and hires locally from the community.</p><p>Spin is expanding quickly and looking for top-tier talent to help us bring affordable and accessible transportation options to cities and define what future safe streets will look like.</p><p><strong>About the Role</strong></p><p>We need backend engineers with proven experience in Rails.

While we’re all polyglots, we have a long love affair with Rails. We own our and deploy our code. We’re concerned about code clarity and communication, as we feel it’s the best measure of quality.</p><p>We promote being a more well rounded engineer by working on different parts of the engineering stack. We also work in small groups to keep processes and overhead low, so we have a lot of trust and accountability to perform the work required to build the best product. We’re still working out the best processes for our team to thrive.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Collaborate with other teams to build and support server-side logic and interfaces that power our product and features</li><li>Write backend services and APIs</li><li>Build for scale, availability, performance and security across the stack</li><li>Extend our public API so developers and partners can take advantage of our platform</li><li>Deliver quality software through comprehensive code reviews and automated testing</li><li>Push your team forward onto the latest and greatest, be it engineering practices, libraries, tools or products</li></ul><p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li>Minimum of 3 years of relevant experience in backend development (Ruby on Rails, Go)</li><li>You have worked with a team of people to build an entire product end-to-end</li><li>You understand relational database systems and schema design</li><li>You have created and supported APIs</li><li>You have experience with how systems work at scale</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits &amp; Perks</strong></p><ul><li>Opportunity to join a fast-growing startup and help shape and establish the company’s industry leadership</li><li>Competitive health benefits</li><li>Unlimited PTO for salaried roles</li><li>Monthly commuter stipend plus pre-tax benefits</li><li>Monthly cell phone bill stipend</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/spin/456da83e-5958-451f-abdc-f94194e1f726' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

So we’re on a quest to find the smartest, most creative, and most motivated people, and create an environment in which they thrive.</p><p><strong>We Are A Remote Company</strong></p><p><strong>You will work from home and have some flexibility to choose your working hours,&nbsp;</strong>allowing you to make time for family, recreation, vacations, or anything that is important to you.</p><p>You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. You’ll have the time to take longer vacations and have fun.</p><p><strong>Every quarter, you’ll travel to an in-person meeting with the entire team to meet and work together face to face.</strong> These meetings are in cities that are fun to visit. In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.</p><p>We think that these in-person meetings are vital to the success of a remote team.</p><p><strong>About the Role</strong></p><p>As a Serverside Developer at Files.com, you will take the lead on helping build cutting edge features into the Files.com product that drive value for the 1,700 business that use our platform for collaboration.</p><p>Our API receives hundreds of requests per second and is used by both internal and external developers.</p><p>Here are some examples of projects that our Serverside Developers will be tackling in the next 6-12 months:</p><ul><li>Implementing Single-Sign-On via OAuth, SAML, and SCIM.</li><li>Implementing in-file search using Elasticsearch with custom input filters to index a plethora of document types.</li><li>Building a scalable engine that can convert nearly any type of files to PDF for in-browser previews (like the former Crocodoc service).</li><li>Upgrading our API documentation to be automatically generated using the OpenAPI standard, and the creation of automatically-generated SDKs.</li><li>Building our Universal Sync engine, which is a tool that allows Files.com users to synchronize their files to other cloud services such as S3, Azure, and Rackspace.</li><li>Building a file versioning tool that uses Git behind the scenes to give customers easy tracking of file versions.</li></ul><p>Additionally, you’ll contribute to our ongoing projects for improving security, monitoring, and performance.</p><p><strong>Minimum Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>5+ years of directly applicable experience.</li><li>Strong Computer Science background and understanding of algorithms and data structures.</li><li>History developing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li><li>Complete understanding of how to write secure code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.</li><li>Experience with Ruby and Rails.</li><li>Appreciation for testing and the ability to write specs using RSpec.</li></ul><p><strong>Preferred Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Participation in open source Ruby gem projects, including ideally being the maintainer for a Gem that sees large usage in the community.</li><li>Strong experience working at scale.</li></ul><p><strong>Our Core Beliefs</strong></p><p><strong>Here are just some of our Core Beliefs:</strong></p><p>We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide variety of programming language experience.We don’t hire for specific programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.</p><p>We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React, Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”</p><p>We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at Files.com, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.</p><p>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p><p><strong>Salary, Pay, and Benefits</strong></p><p>Files.com offers industry-leading salaries based on experience combined with unparalleled flexibility and other benefits to secure top talent.</p><p>You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p><p>We will provide you a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer, desk, or anything else that would help build or refresh your home office.</p><p>We’ll update your salary annually based on your performance, as reviewed by your peers.</p><p>We fully pay base plan health insurance premiums (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 75% of your spouse or dependents if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.files.com/job-ads/ruby-developer' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.   <br>   <br>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list.   <br>   <br>What You Will Be Doing   <br>   <br>You will be part of the development team building our web application platform. &nbsp;You will be&nbsp;&nbsp;helping educate millions of people all around the world.   <br>   <br>Who We Are Looking For   <br>   <br>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone&nbsp;bright&nbsp;with a proven track record in developing software for high&nbsp;quality,&nbsp;scalable&nbsp;applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.   <br>   <br>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:   <br>   <br>   <br>* You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms   <br>   <br>* You are a seasoned JavaScript developer and have a solid knowledge of modern JS frameworks.   <br>   <br>* You work with a spirit of collaboration, especially with other teams, like design and marketing.   <br>   <br>* You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Other things that are helpful to know are Vue.js, Postgres, Heroku and Rails.   <br>   <br>How We Work   <br>   <br>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.   <br>   <br>What We Pay   <br>   <br>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays.   <br>   <br>Benefits   <br>   <br>   <br>* Remote working   <br>   <br>* Flexible hours   <br>   <br>* Large amounts of autonomy   <br>   <br>* Great pay, insurance, benefits   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>So Why HLT?   <br>   <br>If you’re interested in   <br>   <br>   <br>* Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks   <br>   <br>* Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education   <br>   <br>* A fast paced and fun work environment   <br>   <br>* A career with a higher purpose   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Then we we would love to talk to you!  </div> </div>",

We are learning, and trying constantly to add value for our users and the agents wherever we can through different touchpoints, enabling them to make the right choice while maintaining the best user experience.<p>--JD--We're looking for Full Stack Developers who are familiar with Ruby on Rails, HTML and Javascript.If you've had experience with AWS, it will be a good bonus.</p><p>We currently only accept applicants who are either currently residing in Malaysia or who are Malaysian citizens. The option for remote work was there, but as a startup we don't have the luxury to resources and time to closely monitor tech. We prefer that you'd be phisically present for the job.</p><p>--Our Culture-- We are a small family of dreamers, driven by the same vision: to bring on positive changes to the property industry. As a team, our strength lies into our diversity of backgrounds, interests and cultures. We work in an open office environment, which fosters interactions and fast paced decisions. We favor ability and a can-do mindset over experience and degrees. So, if you are ... tired of corporate jobs and want to go maverick a go-getter and usually says “I’ll do it !” in a habit of learning new things Drop everything and apply now because we’re expanding our family!</p><p>Send your resumes / CVs to founders@bumbung.co, we will send you an email with a quick test to see how you fare out. Cheers!</p>",

Noise</p><p>Basecamp is hiring a Senior Programmer on our Security · Infrastructure · Performance team to help keep our products safe, reliable, and fast until the end of the Internet. <strong>We’re accepting applications for the next two weeks with a start date in early September.</strong></p><p><strong>ABOUT THE JOB</strong></p><p>You’ll pitch in on securing our Rails apps, scaling them to match their growth, keeping them fast, and ratcheting up their reliability &amp; robustness, end to end. You’ll develop internal tooling and systems that help our Ops, Support, and Data teams run the business day to day. You’ll groom a sweet, productive app-development experience that puts a premium on designer and programmer happiness. When someone pulls the Andon Cord, you’ll help get to the very bottom of it—and identify &amp; address the systems issue that led it.</p><p>This position is systems, security, tooling, deep-dive debugging, framework-level Rails development, web performance, and internal support, through and through. Its hallmark: getting to the bottom of it. The work draws on a broad, lumpy mix of app/security/privacy/reliability/debug engineering expertise. You can expect to grow in your strengths, versatility, and competence in this job. You can expect an inclusive, eager team who’ll support you in it, rise to challenges with you, and grow together.</p><p>Our product count outnumbers our headcount. Developing low-footprint, reliable, securable, operable, supportable apps is the prevailing wind in our sails. You will put out some fires, including incident response and remediation, but your focus will be reliability and robustness. Less-flammable apps; fewer smoldering embers; automated fire suppression. No heroics. This job isn’t about moving heaven and earth. Yes, we want to be proud of running top-flight, healthy products, but we also want to be kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. Especially in crisis.</p><p><strong>Here are some real examples of the work we’ve done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what this job entails:</strong></p><ul><li>Creating Rails’ Active Storage framework and integrating it with our apps</li><li>Developing our GDPR privacy policy and rolling it out</li><li>Dealing with a credential stuffing attack from A to Z</li><li>Designing a live failover for cloud storage providers so we can tolerate catastrophic failure</li><li>Building an email tracing tool so our support team can help customers track down email delivery issues</li><li>Responding to a Rails security release by understanding the vulnerability, reproducing it, upgrading all apps, and backporting the fix to older versions of Rails</li><li>Figuring out why certain cache hit rates unexpectedly tanked after a deploy</li><li>Fielding a security researcher’s report of a security vulnerability, from validation to fix and awarding bounty</li><li>Evolving our hybrid Docker-based development environment to improve ergonomics for designers &amp; developers</li><li>Addressing stale reads and deadlocks among concurrent web requests and background jobs</li><li>Addressing invitation spam and signup fraud with heuristics devised in concert with our Data team</li><li>Working with our Ops team to gracefully move petabytes of cloud storage from provider A to provider B, with full app and Active Storage support</li></ul><p>This is a snapshot of <em>our</em> experience running production-grade apps and a capable, supportive team for the long haul. Your experience and background will join ours! We have worlds to learn and we’re eager to do it together. You can expect to teach us, coach us, and expect the same in return.</p><p><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></p><p>We’re looking for an experienced candidate who’s ready for a similar breadth and depth of work, but nobody hits the ground running. That’s a lot of different areas of responsibility! You won’t be able to answer every question immediately or know how all the systems work on day one, and we don’t expect you to. Solid fundamentals with software development, systems, troubleshooting, and teamwork pave the way.</p><p>In broad strokes, Managers of One thrive at Basecamp. We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. We’re quick to trust. We see things through. We’re kind to each other, look up to each other, and support each other. We reach for responsibility and hold ourselves accountable. We show up for the work and for each other.</p><p>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. And understand the value in others being heard. We subject ideas to rigorous consideration and challenge each other, but all remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work. That comes with direct feedback, openness to each others’ experience, and willingness to show up for each other as well as for the technical work at hand. We’re in this for the long term.</p><p>We want strong, diverse teams built from different backgrounds, experiences, and identities. We’re ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best work of your career. That starts with working no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis and getting 8+ hours of sleep a night. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.</p><p>You can expect a mindful onboarding process with ramp-up and time to learn. You can expect a team that listens, and to be heard. You can expect to give and provide direct feedback. You can expect to be counted on. You can expect to do your best work and build a career here. We build our apps, our teams, and our company for the long haul, with a strong eye to other teams’ effectiveness &amp; happiness, from design to support and operations. A healthy, resilient app starts with a healthy, resilient organization.</p><p>You might have a CS degree. You might not. That’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.</p><p><strong>This is a remote job. You’re free to work where you work best, anywhere in the world: home office, coworking space, coffeeshops. </strong>While we currently have an office in Chicago, you should be comfortable working remotely—most of the company does! That hinges on effective writing and comfort with open communication. The bulk of our work is written, from pull request discussion to long-form proposals and team chats. <strong>We do require that your normal workday has at least 4 hours overlap with the Chicago workday (currently UTC-5) without impinging on your personal/family life. </strong>Our team spans UTC+2, UTC-4, UTC-5, UTC-7. The company as a whole works works from 30+ cities across 9 countries.</p><p><strong>PAY AND BENEFITS</strong></p><p>We benchmark our pay to the 90th percentile of San Francisco rates. Same position, same pay, no matter where you live: between $145,000 and $179,000, matched to your experience.</p><p>Benefits at Basecamp are all about helping you lead a healthy life outside of work. We won’t treat your life as dead code to be optimized away with free dinners and dry cleaning. You won’t find lures to keep you coding ever longer. Quality time to focus on work starts with quality time to think, exercise, cook a meal, be with family and friends—time to yourself.</p><p>Work can wait. We offer fully-paid parental leave. We work 4-day weeks through the summer (northern hemisphere), enjoy a yearly paid vacation, and take a one-month sabbatical every three years. We subsidize coworking, home offices, and continuing education, whether professional or hobbyist. We look out for our well-being with monthly support for CSA (locally grown produce), fitness, and massage. We match your charitable contributions. All on a foundation of top-shelf health insurance and a retirement plan with a generous match.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-is-hiring-a-senior-programmer/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

You’ll develop internal tooling and systems that help our Ops, Support, and Data teams run the business day to day. You’ll groom a sweet, productive app-development experience that puts a premium on designer and programmer happiness. When someone pulls the&nbsp;, you’ll help get to the very bottom of it—and identify &amp; address the systems issue that led it.</p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fitrevolution.com%2Fkata%2F' rel='nofollow'>Andon Cord</a><p>This position is systems, security, tooling, deep-dive debugging, framework-level Rails development, web performance, and internal support, through and through. Its hallmark: getting to the bottom of it. The work draws on a broad, lumpy mix of app/security/privacy/reliability/debug engineering expertise. You can expect to grow in your strengths, versatility, and competence in this job. You can expect an inclusive, eager team who’ll support you in it, rise to challenges with you, and grow together.</p><p>Our product count outnumbers our headcount. Developing low-footprint, reliable, securable, operable, supportable apps is the prevailing wind in our sails. You will put out some fires, including incident response and remediation, but your focus will be reliability and robustness. Less-flammable apps; fewer smoldering embers; automated fire suppression. No heroics. This job isn’t about moving heaven and earth. Yes, we want to be proud of running top-flight, healthy products, but we also want to be kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. Especially in crisis.</p><p>Here are some real examples of the work we’ve done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what this job entails:</p><ul></ul><li>Creating Rails’ Active Storage framework and integrating it with our apps</li><li>Developing our GDPR privacy policy and rolling it out</li><li>Dealing with a credential stuffing attack from A to Z</li><li>Designing a live failover for cloud storage providers so we can tolerate catastrophic failure</li><li>Building an email tracing tool so our support team can help customers track down email delivery issues</li><li>Responding to a Rails security release by understanding the vulnerability, reproducing it, upgrading all apps, and backporting the fix to older versions of Rails</li><li>Figuring out why certain cache hit rates unexpectedly tanked after a deploy</li><li>Fielding a security researcher’s report of a security vulnerability, from validation to fix and awarding bounty</li><li>Evolving our hybrid Docker-based development environment to improve ergonomics for designers &amp; developers</li><li>Addressing stale reads and deadlocks among concurrent web requests and background jobs</li><li>Addressing invitation spam and signup fraud with heuristics devised in concert with our Data team</li><li>Working with our Ops team to gracefully move petabytes of cloud storage from provider A to provider B, with full app and Active Storage support</li><p>This is a snapshot of&nbsp;&nbsp;experience running production-grade apps and a capable, supportive team for the long haul. Your experience and background will join ours! We have worlds to learn and we’re eager to do it together. You can expect to teach us, coach us, and expect the same in return.</p><em>our</em><p></p><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong><p>We’re looking for an experienced candidate who’s ready for a similar breadth and depth of work, but&nbsp;. That’s a lot of different areas of responsibility! You won’t be able to answer every question immediately or know how all the systems work on day one, and we don’t expect you to. Solid fundamentals with software development, systems, troubleshooting, and teamwork pave the way.</p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fm.signalvnoise.com%2Fnobody-hits-the-ground-running%2F' rel='nofollow'>nobody hits the ground running</a><p>In broad strokes,&nbsp;&nbsp;thrive at Basecamp. We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. We’re quick to trust. We see things through. We’re kind to each other, look up to each other, and support each other. We reach for responsibility and hold ourselves accountable. We show up for the work and for each other.</p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fsignalvnoise.com%2Fposts%2F1430-hire-managers-of-one' rel='nofollow'>Managers of One</a><p>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. And understand the value in others being heard. We subject ideas to rigorous consideration and challenge each other, but all remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. Charging&nbsp;&nbsp;is part of the work. That comes with direct feedback, openness to each others’ experience, and willingness to show up for each other as well as for the technical work at hand. We’re in this for the long term.</p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Forganizationalphysics.com%2F2016%2F06%2F21%2Fhow-full-is-your-trust-battery%2F' rel='nofollow'>the trust battery</a><p>We want strong, diverse teams built from different backgrounds, experiences, and identities. We’re ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best work of your career. That starts with working no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis and getting 8+ hours of sleep a night. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.</p><p>You can expect a mindful onboarding process with ramp-up and time to learn. You can expect a team that listens, and to be heard. You can expect to give and provide direct feedback. You can expect to be counted on. You can expect to do your best work and build a career here. We build our apps, our teams, and our company for the long haul, with a strong eye to other teams’ effectiveness &amp; happiness, from design to support and operations. A healthy, resilient app starts with a healthy, resilient organization.</p><p>You might have a CS degree. You might not. That’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.</p><p>This is a remote job. You’re free to work where you work best, anywhere in the world: home office, coworking space, coffeeshops. While we currently have an office in Chicago, you should be comfortable working remotely—most of the company does! That hinges on effective writing and comfort with open communication. The bulk of our work is written, from pull request discussion to long-form proposals and team chats. We do require that your normal workday has at least 4 hours overlap with the Chicago workday (currently UTC-5) without impinging on your personal/family life. Our team spans UTC+2, UTC-4, UTC-5, UTC-7. The company as a whole works works from 30+ cities across 9 countries.</p><p></p><strong>PAY AND BENEFITS</strong><p>We benchmark our pay to the 90th percentile of San Francisco rates. Same position, same pay, no matter where you live: between $145,000 and $179,000 USD, matched to&nbsp;.</p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbasecamp%2Fhandbook%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Ftitles-for-programmers.md' rel='nofollow'>your experience</a><p>Benefits at Basecamp are all about helping you lead a healthy life outside of work. We won’t treat your life as dead code to be optimized away with free dinners and dry cleaning. You won’t find lures to keep you coding ever longer. Quality time to focus on work starts with quality time to think, exercise, cook a meal, be with family and friends—time to yourself.</p><p>Work can wait. We offer fully-paid parental leave. We work 4-day weeks through the summer (northern hemisphere), enjoy a yearly paid vacation, and take a one-month sabbatical every three years. We subsidize coworking, home offices, and continuing education, whether professional or hobbyist. We look out for our well-being with monthly support for CSA (locally grown produce), fitness, and massage. We match your charitable contributions. All on a foundation of top-shelf health insurance and a retirement plan with a generous match.&nbsp;.</p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbasecamp%2Fhandbook%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fbenefits-and-perks.md' rel='nofollow'>See the full list</a><p></p><strong>HOW TO APPLY</strong><p>Please send an application that speaks directly to this position. There are no right answers or cookie-cutter expectations. Show us your role in Basecamp’s future and Basecamp’s role in yours. Address some of the work we do. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Give it a deep think and take this at your speed. We’re giving you our full attention.</p><p>We’re accepting applications until 2019-07-16 00:00:00 UTC. There’s no benefit to filing early or writing a novel. Keep it sharp, short, and get across what matters to you.</p><p>Next: We expect to take two weeks to review all applications. You’ll hear from us by July 31 about advancement to a written code review. You’ll submit some code you’re proud of, review it, and tell its story. Then on to an interview. Our interviews are one hour, all remote, with your future colleagues, on your schedule. We’ll talk through some of your code and some of ours. No gotchas, brainteasers, or whiteboard coding. We aim to make an offer by August 16 with a start date in early September.</p><p>We know this is a lot of work and there’s a lot on the line. It’s a significant career move to consider. We appreciate the generosity and courage that go into giving us that consideration. Our conversation starts with this post. We look forward to hearing from you.</p><div> <a href='https://basecamp.workable.com/j/FA8E58BE1B' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a></div>",

You'll be collaborating with our Head of Product (who is also our front-end developer), our Rails Developer, and our Head of Data to round out this small and nimble team. We build and maintain an internal Rails app called Handshake that is both a CRM and a suite of workflow tools which we use to deliver the services of our consumer-facing Rails app,  We also have an agent-facing Rails app called, creatively, Agent Pronto Login that real estate agents use to interact with our service.</p><p>We’ll be launching additional services over the next few years, along with the internal tooling needed to support them. In order to continue building, we’re looking to expand our team.</p><h2>Who You Are</h2><p>You’re a Rails developer with 3 or more years of professional experience who thrives in a flexible, self-directed environment. You love helping people, fixing bugs, and solving problems. You transcend the left-brained developer stereotype, have an eye for design, and incorporate UX understanding into the things you build. Additionally:</p><ul><li>You’re self-motivated to learn and incorporate new technologies and keep up with best practices.</li><li>You’re as comfortable writing code for the browser as you are code for the server.</li><li>You believe in the value of testing and rarely ship code without automated tests in place.</li><li>You love building big features, but you’re just as happy working on maintenance tasks to keep things running smoothly.</li><li>You have strong communication skills and are receptive to constructive feedback.</li><li>You have the ability to thoroughly, yet simply, explain features to everyday users.</li><li>You can clearly articulate your thoughts and feelings through writing.</li><li>You’re not afraid to ask for help.</li><li>You’re experienced and proficient with most of the following: Ruby on Rails, Testing tools (RSpec, Capybara), Data stores (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, Memcached), JavaScript frameworks and libraries (Vue, React, Lodash, etc), Webpacker, HTML/CSS, Git, Continuous Integration and deployment systems, Amazon Web Services, Integrating with a variety of APIs</li></ul><h2>How We Make</h2><p>We don’t separate “product” from “engineering.” Our dev team is the product team, and we’re responsible for prioritizing what’s important and helping our users be awesome. We value feedback at every level and encourage everyone on the team (devs or otherwise) to speak up and contribute with their ideas, thoughts, and concerns throughout the process.</p><p>We build our products with Heroku, GitHub, Travis CI, CloudFlare, Twilio, Google Maps, Mandrill, and more. Some of our team works remotely so we communicate often using Slack, Basecamp, and GitHub.</p><h2>Some Specifics</h2><p>We’re hiring immediately for a full-time, salaried position at a competitive market rate. Most of your work will be done from our office in Marietta, though several of us work from home at least one day per week. </p><p>Agent Pronto offers a variety of benefits to full-time employees, including health, dental, and vision insurance, 401k matching, a generous paid time off policy, and more. When working from the office, we provide a daily catered lunch and a dog-friendly space. You can learn more about our company and benefits </p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

We're accepting applications for the next two weeks with a start date in early September.</div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span><b>ABOUT THE JOB</b></span></div><div> <span>You'll pitch in on securing our Rails apps, scaling them to match their growth, keeping them fast, and ratcheting up their reliability &amp; robustness, end to end. You'll develop internal tooling and systems that help our Ops, Support, and Data teams run the business day to day. You'll groom a sweet, productive app-development experience that puts a premium on designer and programmer happiness. When someone pulls the</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fitrevolution.com%2Fkata%2F' rel='nofollow'>Andon Cord</a><span>, you'll help get to the very bottom of it—and identify &amp; address the systems issue that led it.</span> </div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This position is systems, security, tooling, deep-dive debugging, framework-level Rails development, web performance, and internal support, through and through. Its hallmark: getting to the bottom of it. The work draws on a broad, lumpy mix of app/security/privacy/reliability/debug engineering expertise. You can expect to grow in your strengths, versatility, and competence in this job. You can expect an inclusive, eager team who'll support you in it, rise to challenges with you, and grow together.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Our product count outnumbers our headcount. Developing low-footprint, reliable, securable, operable, supportable apps is the prevailing wind in our sails. You will put out some fires, including incident response and remediation, but your focus will be reliability and robustness. Less-flammable apps; fewer smoldering embers; automated fire suppression. No heroics. This job isn't about moving heaven and earth. Yes, we want to be proud of running top-flight, healthy products, but we also want to be kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. Especially in crisis.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Here are some real examples of the work we've done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what this job entails:</span></div><ul><li>Creating Rails' Active Storage framework and integrating it with our apps</li><li>Developing our GDPR privacy policy and rolling it out</li><li>Dealing with a credential stuffing attack from A to Z</li><li>Designing a live failover for cloud storage providers so we can tolerate catastrophic failure</li><li>Building an email tracing tool so our support team can help customers track down email delivery issues</li><li>Responding to a Rails security release by understanding the vulnerability, reproducing it, upgrading all apps, and backporting the fix to older versions of Rails</li><li>Figuring out why certain cache hit rates unexpectedly tanked after a deploy</li><li>Fielding a security researcher's report of a security vulnerability, from validation to fix and awarding bounty</li><li>Evolving our hybrid Docker-based development environment to improve ergonomics for designers &amp; developers</li><li>Addressing stale reads and deadlocks among concurrent web requests and background jobs</li><li>Addressing invitation spam and signup fraud with heuristics devised in concert with our Data team</li><li>Working with our Ops team to gracefully move petabytes of cloud storage from provider A to provider B, with full app and Active Storage support</li></ul><div><br></div><div>This is a snapshot of&nbsp;<em>our</em>&nbsp;experience running production-grade apps and a capable, supportive team for the long haul. Your experience and background will join ours! We have worlds to learn and we're eager to do it together. You can expect to teach us, coach us, and expect the same in return.</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>ABOUT YOU</b></span></div><div> <span>We're looking for an experienced candidate who's ready for a similar breadth and depth of work, but</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fm.signalvnoise.com%2Fnobody-hits-the-ground-running%2F' rel='nofollow'>nobody hits the ground running</a><span>. That's a lot of different areas of responsibility! You won’t be able to answer every question immediately or know how all the systems work on day one, and we don’t expect you to.

We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. We’re quick to trust. We see things through. We’re kind to each other, look up to each other, and support each other. We reach for responsibility and hold ourselves accountable. We show up for the work and for each other.</span> </div><div><span><br></span></div><div> <span>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree.

That comes with direct feedback, openness to each others' experience, and willingness to show up for each other as well as for the technical work at hand. We're in this for the long term.</span> </div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We want strong, diverse teams built from different backgrounds, experiences, and identities. We’re ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best work of your career. That starts with working no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis and getting 8+ hours of sleep a night. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>You can expect a mindful onboarding process with ramp-up and time to learn. You can expect a team that listens, and to be heard. You can expect to give and provide direct feedback. You can expect to be counted on. You can expect to do your best work and build a career here. We build our apps, our teams, and our company for the long haul, with a strong eye to other teams' effectiveness &amp; happiness, from design to support and operations. A healthy, resilient app starts with a healthy, resilient organization.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>You might have a CS degree. You might not. That's not what we're looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>This is a remote job. You're free to work where you work best, anywhere in the world: home office, coworking space, coffeeshops. While we currently have an office in Chicago, you should be comfortable working remotely—most of the company does! That hinges on effective writing and comfort with open communication. The bulk of our work is written, from pull request discussion to long-form proposals and team chats. We do require that your normal workday has at least 4 hours overlap with the Chicago workday (currently UTC-5) without impinging on your personal/family life. Our team spans UTC+1, UTC-4, UTC-5, UTC-7. The company as a whole works works from 30+ cities across 9 countries.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>PAY AND BENEFITS</b></span></div><div> <span>We benchmark our pay to the 90th percentile of San Francisco rates. Same position, same pay, no matter where you live: between $145,000 and $179,000 USD, matched to</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbasecamp%2Fhandbook%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Ftitles-for-programmers.md' rel='nofollow'>your experience</a><span>.</span> </div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Benefits at Basecamp are all about helping you lead a healthy life outside of work. We won't treat your life as dead code to be optimized away with free dinners and dry cleaning. You won't find lures to keep you coding ever longer. Quality time to focus on work starts with quality time to think, exercise, cook a meal, be with family and friends—time to yourself.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div> <span>Work can wait. We offer fully-paid parental leave. We work 4-day weeks through the summer (northern hemisphere), enjoy a yearly paid vacation, and take a one-month sabbatical every three years. We subsidize coworking, home offices, and continuing education, whether professional or hobbyist. We look out for our well-being with monthly support for CSA (locally grown produce), fitness, and massage. We match your charitable contributions. All on a foundation of top-shelf health insurance and a retirement plan with a generous match.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbasecamp%2Fhandbook%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fbenefits-and-perks.md' rel='nofollow'>See the full list</a><span>.</span> </div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>HOW TO APPLY</b></span></div><div><span>Please send an application that speaks directly to this position. There are no right answers or cookie-cutter expectations. Show us your role in Basecamp's future and Basecamp's role in yours. Address some of the work we do. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Give it a deep think and take this at your speed. We're giving you our full attention.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We're accepting applications until 2019-07-16 00:00:00 UTC. There's no benefit to filing early or writing a novel. Keep it sharp, short, and get across what matters to you.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Next: We expect to take two weeks to review all applications. You'll hear from us by July 31 about advancement to a written code review. You'll submit some code you're proud of, review it, and tell its story. Then on to an interview. Our interviews are one hour, all remote, with your future colleagues, on your schedule. We'll talk through some of your code and some of ours. No gotchas, brainteasers, or whiteboard coding. We aim to make an offer by August 16 with a start date in early September.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We know this is a lot of work and there's a lot on the line. It's a significant career move to consider. We appreciate the generosity and courage that go into giving us that consideration. Our conversation starts with this post. We look forward to hearing from you.</span></div><span>Apply now</span></div>",

    "content": "SimplePay | Ruby on Rails Developers | Cape Town, South Africa | REMOTE<p>The story (skip this paragraph if you don't like stories in your job posts): I founded and continue to run this startup. Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, a year ago I moved Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.</p><p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. More here: <a href='https://www.simplepay.co.za/about' rel='nofollow'>https://www.simplepay.co.za/about</a></p><p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.</p><p>The work will include: Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Doing direct integrations with banks that offer good APIs. Squashing bugs. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).</p><p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know some Ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.</p><p>Location: Most of the team is in GMT+2, and I'll be in GMT+8 going forward. So anything from GMT+0 to GMT+8 should be OK.</p><p>Please mail developers+hn@simplepay.cloud and include a direct link to an open source contribution you've made, or an issue you've logged, no matter how small. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.</p>",

Although we at Getaway leverage these tools like any other business does, our product seeks to physically take our customers away from these things in an effort to find the magic and relaxation they’ve so desperately been seeking. We’re putting tiny houses on camp sites in remote locations so our “users” can get away and set up a high-speed interface with their humanity. We create and maintain technology that, in some cases invisibly, enables a mystical experience for our guests and removes stress from their lives!</p><p>Getaway is a small but rapidly growing team that just raised a $22.5M Series B financing round. Our offices our located in Downtown Brooklyn but we are open to semi-remote candidates that can visit our offices at least twice a month.</p><p>The Back End Developer will focus on the following areas:- Building new features for and maintaining the current functionality of our website, written  with a Ruby on Rails back end and a React/SASS front end, in a semi-agile working environment- Brainstorming and iterating on existing features, with some projects in the next few months including a new accounts portal for our guests, a new financial data analysis software to be built, and ensuring our site can handle more traffic as we scale- Some minor developer operations tasks ensuring the website is serving our customers well and performing to our expectations - we’re hosted currently on Heroku- Supporting the cabin automation effort, working on software to make the guest experience seamless and magical, including work on our house door lock automation software and leak sensors, for instance. This is mostly written in Ruby and Groovy, soon moving to all Python and Ruby- Writing internal tools to support our Guest Experience team and make it extremely easy for guests to get the things they need to have a wonderful time on their Getaways- Continuing to find efficiencies and ways to leverage software to improve our team’s workflows and the way we do business- Occasionally writing code in front of a fire, if you so desire (for real!)</p><p>We’re looking for someone with around 2 years of experience but don’t want anyone to shy away from applying if they think they’re a real “rockstar/ninja/etc”. This is not a junior development role and those straight out of school or bootcamp need not apply, unfortunately we just don’t have the resources to support such a candidate at this time.</p><p>Interested developers should send a short cover letter and resume to jobs@getaway.house, subject line, “Back End Developer Role”.</p>",

We’ve shaped our team and our way of working around this. Our engineering team would not be the most transformative team at building a mobile operating system. We’d be quite bad at that. We’re exceptionally good at building the type of software that is necessary to invoke change in the insurance industry.</p><p>For more information on engineering at Root see <a href='https://eng.joinroot.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://eng.joinroot.com</a></p><p>Staff Engineers at Root are our most trusted technical experts. &nbsp;They work across multiple teams of engineers to set and coordinate technical direction. &nbsp;Staff Engineers facilitate the delivery of large project and features by helping design solutions, pair programming with other engineers, contributing to code review and by writing code themselves. They help strengthen the technical prowess of the entire engineering organization by mentoring and growing the engineers around them.</p><p>We divide the areas of responsibility for engineers into three major areas:</p><p><strong>Technical:&nbsp;</strong>The skills and knowledge that make up an engineer’s basic problem-solving toolbox.<br><strong>Planning and Execution:&nbsp;</strong>The ability to plan and execute assigned work beyond basic technical solutions.<br><strong>Working with Others:&nbsp;</strong>The ability to work effectively with other engineers and people in other functions.</p><p><strong>Scope of Impact:</strong> Multiple Teams, Large Initiatives, or Company</p><p><strong>What we look for in Staff Software Engineers</strong>:</p><ul><li>Technical Skills:</li><ul><li>Deep understanding of technologies used in our stack, client-server architecture, and web technologies</li><li>Ability to architect complex, high-scale web applications, and data solutions</li><li>Incorporates testing and thinks about reliability as a natural part of delivering working software</li><li>Experienced with several programming paradigms</li><li>Expert-level knowledge of databases, SQL, and version control tools</li><li>Thorough understanding of infrastructure and DevOps</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Planning and Execution:</li><ul><li>Plans and completes large and complex multi-person or multi-team projects</li><li>Foresees issues and requirements for large projects and features</li><li>Thinks critically about work to guarantee business functionality.

Other insurance companies don't know whether people are good drivers or bad drivers. They set insurance prices based on crude demographic factors like age and gender, resulting in bad drivers paying too little, and good drivers paying too much. At Root we are changing that. We've created a way to understand how people actually drive, so that we can give the best drivers the best insurance prices.&nbsp;We have an opportunity to collectively save people billions of dollars a year.</p><p>We received regulatory approval from the Ohio Department of Insurance in 2016 to become an officially licensed insurance carrier. This enabled us to launch and start selling policies.&nbsp;In 2019, we will be focused on adding top engineering talent to our current team of 70 engineers while also increasing the number of states we are licensed&nbsp;to sell in.</p><p>With $175M of funding, a stellar team, and&nbsp;our product on the market, it certainly is an exciting time to join our growing team!</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full medical, dental, and vision benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Open vacation policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Top salaries (we're looking for top talent)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equity</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Catered lunch (Monday - Friday)</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

They come to us looking for a team to provide dependable support and maintenance of their existing Ruby on Rails (and a handful of React) projects. We do this in the form of recurring retainers where we take care of small feature updates, bug fixes, performance improvements, chipping away at their technical debt, and helping them experiment as they navigate their forward as a business.</p><p>What we rarely do? Is spin up brand new web applications for them. We learned years ago that there is rarely a long-term client relationship with startups (as they tend to flop in 1-2 years). So, we stopped competing on those projects.</p><p>The tradeoff? We get to build lasting partnerships with our clients and have some influence on how they’re planning for their life of their web applications.</p><p>So…if you’re the type of developer that really enjoys shiny and new things (and/or pitching entire app rewrites)… this probably isn’t the position for you.</p><p>If you’re the type of developer that enjoys jumping into the deep end of complex projects, helping iterate and improve software, likes to take on responsibility and be given opportunities to help lead projects… then we should talk.</p><p><strong>Our Core Values</strong></p><ul><li>PROACTIVE – We actively seek opportunities to improve our client’s products, our processes, and our abilities.</li><li>CURIOUS – A natural curiosity for the undiscovered results in remarkable work for our clients – and stronger connections for our team. We ask questions, learn, and aren’t afraid to fail.</li><li>DEPENDABLE – We are invested in our work. We manage expectations. We support our clients and teammates. We hold ourselves, our teammates, and our clients accountable.</li><li>VERSATILE – We readily adapt to change and encourage innovation because our team and work are transparent and flexible.</li><li>DELIGHTFUL – We choose to set a mindful, positive tone that allows everyone to flourish.</li></ul><p>We are a small team and wear many hats. In addition to the list of responsibilities below we also expect all of our team members to participate in our marketing efforts, whether that’s you writing blog posts, offering to speak at a conference, or coming up with ideas for new initiatives.</p><p><strong>What you’ll typically be focused on…</strong></p><ul><li>Participating in short daily standups to outline what you completed yesterday and are aiming to accomplish today</li><li>Jumping between ~2-5 client projects/week (sometimes a few each day)</li><li>Keeping an eye out for your teammates. Perhaps you could lend them a hand to tackle a challenge and/or vice versa</li><li>Getting your head wrapped around a subset of our client projects and their business goals</li><li>Partnering up with your project manager to figure out how to best prioritize your work this coming week</li><li>Collaborating with your team members to help with these projects (from planning, estimating, coding, testing, and bug fixing)</li><li>Documenting the tricks and lessons you learn to share with the dev community on our blog</li><li>Asking clients for clarification on requirements that you aren’t sure that you understand</li><li>Being an advocate for the long-term health and maintainability of our client’s projects</li><li>Saying,&nbsp;<em>“I don’t know&nbsp;</em>(yet)<em>&nbsp;… but I’ll help figure it out!”</em>&nbsp;to clients and peers</li><li>Improving the overall test coverage of our client projects</li><li>Helping pick out music to play on the studio stereo system (unless you’re remote)</li><li>Performing code reviews on your teammate’s pull-requests</li><li>Googling weird error messages…a lot</li><li>Sharing praise when someone on the team does something amazing</li><li>Occassionally helping out with DevOps/sysadmin tasks</li><li>Sending your code for peer review</li><li>Stumbling across possible fixes in API docs, Stack Overflow, and Github issues</li><li><strong>Taking advantage of our flextime scheduling to swing by the gym, go for a run before the rain starts, or maybe sitting in the park with a book</strong></li><li>Rolling your eyes as you look at that code that wasn’t working and realizing the silly typo</li><li>Capturing your “lesson learned” to share with the team this next Monday morning</li><li>Communicating directly with clients to help define features/user stories, improvements to existing applications</li><li>Writing, refactoring, and improving our client’s web applications and APIs (…we have a few internal projects, too)</li><li>Sending clients a link to a staging environment so they can test out your changes before you deploy to production</li><li>Deploying code to staging/production environments</li><li>Petting the dog that swings by your desk to say hi (unless you’re remote…do you have your own dog to pet?)</li><li>Tracking time for our client work so that we can pay our bills</li><li>Appreciating when your teammates share their failures with you</li><li>Sitting down with interns/junior developers to hone your mentoring skills (or popping on a screen share if you’re remote)</li><li>Removing noise in the README files that we probably should have cleaned up a while ago</li><li>Thanking clients when they provide great requirements that helps you out</li><li>Sharing your hard lessons/failures with your peers</li><li>Noticing inefficiencies in our existing processes and taking note to raise it at our next team meeting</li><li>Adding useful information to the README files that will help your teammates</li><li>Carving out a little time each week to try out some new tools</li><li>Sharing useful links with your peers in Slack</li><li>Preparing a 5-to-10-minute talk on how to use said new tool for our next company workshop series</li><li>Helping us become a better version of ourselves than we were yesterday</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>3.141592653+ years of experience with Ruby on Rails</li><li>Ability to convey your thoughts/ideas verbally and written…with a delightful (and competent) tone</li><li>Experience collaborating with clients/stakeholders/decisionmakers/mimes. (bonus points if you can read their minds)</li><li>Some general concepts of how SQL database work and how to navigate them</li><li>Comfortable with a Apple Mac environment (maybe you even like to dabble with Linux?)</li><li>Know more than enough Git to be dangerous</li><li>Experience writing automated tests for Ruby on Rails apps</li><li>Using Capistrano, Git, etc to handle Rails deployments</li><li>Knowledge of HTML and understanding of CSS/Sass</li><li>Worked with JavaScript frameworks like React, Ember, Angular, and/or Backbone.</li><li>Knowledge of software design patterns and experience with implementation</li></ul><p><strong>NOTE: If you’re not in the Portland area — you might be our first full-time remote employee! We have much to learn about working in that way. We have some good ideas on how to make this work well — and will be mindful to take healthy steps together. It’ll not be perfect but we want to explore this with you.</strong></p><p>Responses from freelancers, design studios or recruiters offering their services will be ignored.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p>After three months of full-time employment, we provide:</p><ul><li>Medical &amp; dental insurance (PLANET ARGON pays 80% of premium);</li><li>SIMPLE IRA with 3% of employee salary match;</li><li>Paid vacation that increases with your length of employment; (15 days accrued the first year, 20 days after the first year, and 25 days after three years)</li><li>Five days of sick time each calendar year;</li><li>Six paid holidays yearly;</li><li>Periodic bonuses dependent upon company and employee performance; and</li><li>Participation in our flexible work time policies.</li></ul><p>We will perform background checks and request professional references from finalist candidates.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

    "content": "<h3>Humbly Confident Full Stack Developer</h3><div><p><strong><strong>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</strong></strong></p><p>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;, or read some of our&nbsp;, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in!&nbsp;We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;<em>click</em>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</p><p>But&nbsp;first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></strong></p><p>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.</p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s&nbsp;<em>external</em>&nbsp;competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.</p><p><strong><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named&nbsp;) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></strong></p><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></strong></p><p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done, a&nbsp;&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on&nbsp;. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong><strong>Up Your Game</strong></strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re International...</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;<em>and your family.</em>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;<em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;<em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>You will change lives.</em></p><p><strong><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</strong></strong></p><p>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).</p><p>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.</p><p>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).</p><p>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:</p><ul><li>“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”</li><li>“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd&nbsp;party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”</li><li>We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?</li><li>“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”</li></ul><p><strong><strong>You’re our person if you:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.</li><li>Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Integrating with 3rd&nbsp;party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.</li><li>Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.</li><li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.</li><li>Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.</li><li>Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.</li><li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.</li><li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.</li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p></p><ul><li>Apply below (<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>here</a>) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on&nbsp;<strong>June 30th, 2019</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Firm. It’s a real deadline.</li></ul><ul><li>First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:</li><li>You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</li><ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and&nbsp;<strong>why you would be a great fit for the position</strong>. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).</li><li>Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)</li><li>Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.</li><li>Includes answers to the following questions:</li><ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them?</li><li>Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position,&nbsp;what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>Complete this short coding test (<a href='https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb' rel='nofollow'>https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb</a>) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.</li></ul></ul></ul><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

They come to us looking for a team to provide dependable support and maintenance of their existing Ruby on Rails (and a handful of React) projects.

(But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;Google us, or read some of our&nbsp;reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.   <br>   <br>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.   <br>   <br>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our&nbsp;web app&nbsp;and&nbsp;API. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in!&nbsp;We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original&nbsp;Cultural Manifesto&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;click&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!   <br>   <br>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side&nbsp;really&nbsp;well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.   <br>   <br>But&nbsp;first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.   <br>   <br>Who you’d be working with:   <br>   <br>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.   <br>   <br>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s&nbsp;external&nbsp;competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.   <br>   <br>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.   <br>   <br>How You’ll Work at YNAB   <br>   <br>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named&nbsp;Fortune’s #2 Best Small Company to Work For) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:   <br>   <br>Live Where You Want   <br>   <br>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.   <br>   <br>No Crazy Hours   <br>   <br>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.   <br>   <br>Take Vacation (Seriously)   <br>   <br>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;minimum&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.   <br>   <br>The YNAB Retreat   <br>   <br>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done&nbsp;Costa Rica, a&nbsp;gigantic cabin&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on&nbsp;Laguna Beach. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.   <br>   <br>Up Your Game   <br>   <br>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.   <br>   <br>If You’re International...   <br>   <br>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.   <br>   <br>If You’re Stateside…   <br>   <br>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;and your family.&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)   <br>   <br>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;your retirement&nbsp;nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)   <br>   <br>Other Tidbits   <br>   <br>   <br>* Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)   <br>   <br>* The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.   <br>   <br>* We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.   <br>   <br>* We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;standing?) in front of a computer.   <br>   <br>* We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.   <br>   <br>* Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will change lives.   <br>   <br>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer   <br>   <br>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).   <br>   <br>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.   <br>   <br>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).   <br>   <br>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:   <br>   <br>   <br>* “How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”   <br>   <br>* “We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd&nbsp;party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”   <br>   <br>* We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?   <br>   <br>* “We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>You’re our person if you:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.   <br>   <br>* Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.   <br>   <br>* Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.   <br>   <br>* Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)   <br>   <br>* Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.   <br>   <br>* Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.   <br>   <br>* Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Integrating with 3rd&nbsp;party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.   <br>   <br>* Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.   <br>   <br>* Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.   <br>   <br>* Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.   <br>   <br>* Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.   <br>   <br>* Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.   <br>   <br>* Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for&nbsp;all&nbsp;employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.   <br>   <br>How to Apply   <br>   <br>   <br>* Apply below (here) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on&nbsp;June 30th, 2019.&nbsp;Firm. It’s a real deadline.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:   <br>   <br>* You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and&nbsp;why you would be a great fit for the position. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).   <br>   <br>* Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)   <br>   <br>* Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.   <br>   <br>* Includes answers to the following questions:   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them?   <br>   <br>* Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.   <br>   <br>* If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position,&nbsp;what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?   <br>   <br>* Complete this short coding test (https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We look forward to hearing from you!   <br>   <br>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!  </div> </div>",

(But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our&nbsp;<a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8' rel='nofollow'>reviews on the app store</a>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our&nbsp;<a href='https://app.youneedabudget.com/' rel='nofollow'>web app</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://api.youneedabudget.com/' rel='nofollow'>API</a>. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in!&nbsp;We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;Cultural Manifesto</a>&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;<em>click</em>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</p><p>But&nbsp;first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></strong></p><p>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.</p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s&nbsp;<em>external</em>&nbsp;competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.</p><p><strong><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named&nbsp;<a href='http://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune’s #2 Best Small Company to Work For</a>) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></strong></p><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></strong></p><p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;Costa Rica</a>, a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'>Laguna Beach</a>. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong><strong>Up Your Game</strong></strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re International...</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;<em>and your family.</em>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;<em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;<em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>You will change lives.</em></p><p><strong><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</strong></strong></p><p>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).</p><p>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.</p><p>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).</p><p>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:</p><ul><li>“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”</li><li>“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd&nbsp;party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”</li><li>We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?</li><li>“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”</li></ul><p><strong><strong>You’re our person if you:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.</li><li>Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Integrating with 3rd&nbsp;party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.</li><li>Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.</li><li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.</li><li>Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.</li><li>Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.</li><li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.</li><li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.</li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p><strong><strong>How to Apply</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Apply below (<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>here</a>) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on&nbsp;<strong>June 30th, 2019</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Firm. It’s a real deadline.</li></ul><ul><li>First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:</li><li>You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</li><ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and&nbsp;<strong>why you would be a great fit for the position</strong>. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).</li><li>Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects.

We currently have over 290 clients based throughout the UK and Ireland. These clients are a mixture of Theatres, Arts, Festivals and speciality offerings such as Ice Skating and Christmas attractions. We are a consistently profitable company with a healthy year on year growth. The new features and abilities we are adding to Ticketsolve put us in an excellent place to deliver strong growth in the coming years.   <br>   <br># Introduction   <br>We are currently going through an exciting evolution of our platform. We are moving from a traditional RoR architecture to a modern &quot;single page application&quot;, exposing our application as a set of API's consumed by Ember to provide a rich interactive experience.   <br>   <br>We have migrated our customer-facing ticket selling application to Ember and our ticket scanning application to Ember, with great success. We are currently working on rebuilding the backend of our platform with the immediate focus been on our &quot;Point of Sale&quot;. We are now looking to add to our team to accelerate the creation and rollout of this change across the remainder of our platform. This covers the CRM, reporting/analytics and configurations aspects of our backend.   <br>   <br>Over the last few months, we have grown the front end, Ember team. We are now looking to expand our server team with new people to cover Ruby and Ruby on Rails server development. Ideally, this person will have RoR experience. In terms of experience, we are open to both junior and experienced developers - the main requirement is talent and enthusiasm.   <br>   <br># How we work   <br>We run a lightweight process that focuses on feature-based delivery on a weekly basis. Our coordination and communication are mostly through daily 'catch-up meetings' and use of appropriate tools such as Trello for backlog management, Slack for communication and Git(GitHub) for source control and feature deployment through PRs and Milestones.   <br>   <br>From a coding perspective, we place a strong emphasis on clean, minimal, well-refactored code backed up by a robust suite of automated tests. We make use of peer review for all design and development work.   <br>   <br>In general, we strive for an approach that empowers and trusts individuals to 'do the right thing', and as a team, we try and keep each other true to this.   <br>   <br># Remote working   <br>Our development team works as a remote team with members in Berlin, Malmö, Barcelona, Singapore and Taiwan. Our wider organisation has people based in United Kingdom and Dublin. Dublin is our headquarters and main office space - with core Support team and Sales and Marketing team.   <br>   <br>Remote working has become part of our company DNA. We believe that it offers a lot of advantages to both Ticketsolve and employees. This means that you should be comfortable working as part of a remote team. If this is new to you, don't worry, it was for us at the beginning as well. We now have lots of experience helping people settle in - so keep an open mind and imagine a working day with no daily commute!   <br>   <br>Important to note that timezones are a consideration for us with remote working. Our experience is that European and Asian time zones are preferable, as it allows for collaboration at reasonable times.   <br>   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br># Skills &amp; Requirements   <br>- 2+ years experience developing web applications   <br>- Experience with programming Ruby/Rails required with the role focused on server development   <br>- Understanding of front-end technologies: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, SASS, Ember preferred, but not required   <br>- Experience with Chef and Terraform a bonus   <br>- Strong programming skills with a focus on clean design, well-refactored code and automated testing   <br>- Comfortable working as part of a remote team   <br>   <br># Technologies we use   <br>- Ruby on Rails is our primary server framework evolving towards pure API server   <br>- Ember is our primary front end development framework   <br>- JSONAPI::Resources, http://jsonapi-resources.com/, is how we are building our API's   <br>- MySQL / Redis / Elastic are our primary storage engines   <br>- All our servers are Ubuntu based managed through CHEF   <br>- Deployed on AWS using terraform for managing infrastructure   <br>- GitHub for source code management and process support   <br>- Travis for continuous integration   <br>   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- European and Asian time zones are preferable   <br>  </div> </div>",

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.   <br>   <br>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;build a business&nbsp;not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.   <br>   <br>See how our clients&nbsp;talk&nbsp;about&nbsp;our approach&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;recognition we've received&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;holiday gifts&nbsp;each year. Or, if you're a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;Seaworthy, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!   <br>   <br>A Day In The Life   <br>   <br>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;team&nbsp;week&nbsp;recaps&nbsp;and&nbsp;years in review&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!   <br>   <br>What Does Success Look Like?   <br>   <br>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.   <br>   <br>After this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;Welcome aboard!   <br>   <br>Ongoing Support   <br>   <br>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Individual quarterly goal progress   <br>   <br>* Project status / team issues / weekly retro   <br>   <br>* Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Quarterly and Annual Reviews   <br>   <br>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We're here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.   <br>   <br>Experience and Results At Every Level   <br>   <br>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019.

We need your help to take us to the next level!</p><p><strong><strong>A Day In The Life</strong></strong></p><p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin.

This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p><p>After this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<strong><em>Welcome aboard!</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing Support</strong></p><p>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful.

Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase.

We need your help to take us to the next level!</p><p><strong><strong>A Day In The Life</strong></strong></p><p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p><p><strong><strong>What Does Success Look Like?</strong></strong></p><p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p><p>After this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<strong><em>Welcome aboard!</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing Support</strong></p><p>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful.

Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase.

    "content": "<h3>Humbly Confident Full Stack Developer</h3><div><p><strong>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</strong></p><p>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. , or , and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </p><p>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our  and . All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in! We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original  has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! </p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side really well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</p><p>But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </p><p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p><p>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. </p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. </p><p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Live Where You Want</strong>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done , a  in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on . We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong>If You’re International...</strong>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. </p><p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. You will change lives. </p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</strong> </p><p>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).</p><p>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.</p><p>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).</p><p>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:</p><ul><li>“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”</li><li>“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”</li><li>We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?</li><li>“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”</li></ul><p><strong>You’re our person if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.</li><li>Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).</li></ul><p><strong>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:</strong></p><ul><li>Integrating with 3rd party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.</li><li>Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.</li><li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.</li><li>Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.</li><li>Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.</li><li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.</li><li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.</li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p> </p><ul><li>Apply <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>here</a> by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on <strong>June 30th, 2019</strong>. Firm. It’s a real deadline.</li><li>First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:</li><li>You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</li><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and <strong>why you would be a great fit for the position</strong>. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).</li><li>Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)</li><li>Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.</li><li>Includes answers to the following questions:</li><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them? </li><li>Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>Complete this short coding test (https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.</li></ul><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>P.S. If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

    "content": "**About Us and Why We’re Hiring**We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. [Google us](https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab), or [read some of our reviews on the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8), and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our [web app](https://app.youneedabudget.com/users/authentication) and [API](https://api.youneedabudget.com/). All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in! We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original [Cultural Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit) has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side really well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. **Who you’d be working with:**Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. **How You’ll Work at YNAB**We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:**Live Where You Want**We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.**No Crazy Hours**We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.**Take Vacation (Seriously)**We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.**The YNAB Retreat**We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done [Costa Rica](https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343), a [gigantic cabin](https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/) in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on [Laguna Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be). We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.**Up Your Game**We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.**If You’re International...**You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. **If You’re Stateside…**You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)**Other Tidbits**- Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) - The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. - We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.- We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.- We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.- Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.  You will change lives. **Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer** You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:- “How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”- “We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”- We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?- “We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”**You’re our person if you:**- Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.- Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.- Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.- Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)- Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.- Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.- Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).**Some things you might be working on at YNAB:**- Integrating with 3rd party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.- Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.- Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.- Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.- Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.- Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.- Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.**How to Apply** - Apply [here](https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on **June 30th, 2019**. Firm. It’s a real deadline.- First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:- You DO need a cover letter.

    "content": "<h2> Humbly Confident Full Stack Developer </h2><div><div><span><h2><span>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</span></h2></span></div><div><span>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a><span>, or read some of our </span><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8' rel='nofollow'><span>reviews on the app store</span></a><span>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our </span><a href='https://app.youneedabudget.com' rel='nofollow'><span>web app</span></a><span> and </span><a href='https://api.youneedabudget.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>API</span></a><span>. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in! </span><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original&nbsp;</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'><span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span>&nbsp;(</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit' rel='nofollow'>https://bit.ly/2DAv83H</a>) has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</div><div><br></div><div><span>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side </span><em>really</em><span> well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>But </span><span>first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h2>Who you'd be working with:</h2></div><div><span>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s </span><em>external</em><span> competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h2>How You'll Work at YNAB</h2></div><div><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Live Where You Want</span></h4></div><div><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h4></div><div><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h4></div><div><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span><em>minimum</em><span> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>The YNAB Retreat</span></h4></div><div><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a><span>, a </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a><span> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on </span><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'><span>Laguna Beach</span></a><span>. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Up Your Game</span></h4></div><div><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>If You’re International...</span></h4></div><div><span>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h4></div><div><span>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span><em>and your family.</em><span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span><em>your retirement</em><span></span><em>nest egg</em><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Other Tidbits</span></h4></div><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span><br></li><li><span>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span><br></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span><br></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span><br></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span><br></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</span><br><br></li></ul><div><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>You will change lives. </em></div><div><br></div><div><h2>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</h2></div><div><span>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites).

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that’s a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.</p><p>Because we’re more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;<em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.</p><p>See how our clients&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we’ve received</a>&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/holiday-collaboration-with-velodrome-coffee/' rel='nofollow'>holiday gifts</a>&nbsp;each year. Or, if you’re a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/seaworthy/' rel='nofollow'>Seaworthy</a>, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We’re excited about what we’ve achieved in the last few years, but we’re just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!</p><h3><span>A Day In The Life</span></h3><p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p><h3><span>What Does Success Look Like?</span></h3><p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you’ll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several “Headway 101” sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you’re new to one of our tech stacks, we’ll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p><p>You’ll have dedicated pairing time scheduled with various colleagues to cover different skills, and we’ll even participate in several mock client meetings so your first standup or sprint planning meeting doesn’t carry with it the weight of your first client interaction. After this training period, you’ll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You’ll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<span><em>Welcome aboard!</em></span></p><p><span>Ongoing Support</span></p><p>Each week, you’ll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:</p><ul><li>Individual quarterly goal progress</li><li>Project status / team issues / weekly retro</li><li>Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire</li></ul><p><span>Quarterly and Annual Reviews</span></p><p>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We’re here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.</p><h3><span>Experience and Results At Every Level</span></h3><p>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019. Our business is guided by&nbsp;<a href='https://www.eosworldwide.com/eos-model' rel='nofollow'>EOS</a>&nbsp;and we have strong processes, documentation, and people to support your growth and development.

    "content": "10flats is a search algorithm that seeks to disrupt the way people search for real estate. We all have rented apartments and know how frustrating and time-consuming it might be scrolling through hundreds of posts trying the find some real gems. The biggest problem is the listing portal itself. The way they monetize their business models involves tons of listings. The more posts there are, the more money they make. Easy. The problem, however, is that no user is interested in the endless scrolling of hundreds of places – (s)he is interested in finding THE place.<br /><br />This is where 10flats kicks in. A typical client normally visits about 10 properties before moving in. So what stops other listing portals from limiting search result to 10 at max? The answer is – their poor algorithms. The portals simply cannot capture the entire decision-making process, and thus they stick to what's simple and easy. They use the unit (apartment or house) as the key driver in search, i.e. size, bedrooms, bathrooms, furnished, home appliances, windows face south, etc. However, when a person moves in, (s)he surprisingly finds out that the nearest grocery store is 3 blocks away, the closest gym is 30 minutes bus distance, the only school in the neighborhood happens to be senior and not primary. These are the drivers of the ecosystem that create and support our lifestyle. They are never accounted for by search algorithms.<br /><br />10flats uses an extended search algorithm to find those missing bits of lifestyle. What is the benefit for the user? 10flat within 60 seconds can return 10 curated listings that match your living criteria 90% and more. No more times wasted scrolling, no more time wasted researching neighborhoods, no more visits to mismatched apartments. Stop scrolling, start living.<br /><br />10flats is looking for another team member, an enthusiasts web developer who would support the algorithm on the client side in our journey to disrupt the real estate search. This position is not salaried but with a substantial part of equity upon incorporation. Please also note that we are looking to start in DACH so the role better have a good command of German, besides English or Russian.",

Transportation technology is a hot market and we’re leading the charge, with raving fans and new customers signing up every day. We're looking for an experienced, driven, product-focused Senior Rails Engineer to help us deliver amazing features to our customers.   <br>   <br>   <br>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING   <br>   <br>Your work will be heavily focused toward high level, high impact areas. You’ll work closely with Product Managers and Designers to plan, design, and implement some of our more complex features. You’ll have a strong voice in the development and planning processes, so prior senior-level experience is key.   <br>   <br>We work in weekly sprints and use Pivotal Tracker to keep things organized. While we keep meetings to a minimum, our remote team is heavily collaborative and takes advantage of modern tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Zoom to stay in touch.   <br>   <br>Our stack includes Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Postgres and Heroku. We’re currently on Rails 5.1 and strive to keep our frameworks and libraries up to date.   <br>   <br>This is a position we consider essential to the company’s success. Be sure to mention coffee in your application so we know you actually read this.   <br>   <br>   <br>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU   <br>   <br>   <br>* Be a part of an incredible team of “A” players who go above and beyond to make Fleetio a successful company.

Crafting a delightful user experience is hard work, but we welcome the challenge and are looking for team members who share our ambition.   <br>   <br>We’re a startup that’s in “scale up” mode, meaning we’re past the days of just a couple of people in a small office, but we’re still very much a fast-paced, highly collaborative company.   <br>   <br>Our top goal as product engineers is adding value to our customers and we love to get changes out quickly. We've optimized our CI/CD to make it painless to run our test suite and get code into our production Heroku environments easily, resulting in an average of 40 deploys per week.   <br>   <br>We place great value on work/life balance and abhor the stereotypical 100 hours/week startup life. We have families and know you do, too.

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.</p><p>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;<em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.</p><p>See how our clients&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we've received</a>&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/holiday-collaboration-with-velodrome-coffee/' rel='nofollow'>holiday gifts</a>&nbsp;each year. Or, if you're a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/seaworthy/' rel='nofollow'>Seaworthy</a>, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!</p><p><strong><strong>A Day In The Life</strong></strong></p><p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p><p><strong><strong>What Does Success Look Like?</strong></strong></p><p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p><p>You'll have dedicated pairing time scheduled with various colleagues to cover different skills, and we'll even participate in several mock client meetings so your first standup or sprint planning meeting doesn't carry with it the weight of your first client interaction.

Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, a year ago I moved Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.</p><p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. To give you an idea, here's our South African website: <a href='https://www.simplepay.co.za' rel='nofollow'>https://www.simplepay.co.za</a></p><p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.</p><p>The work will include: Doing direct integrations with other systems (hopefully banks too, eventually). Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Improving security. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).</p><p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire senior developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.</p><p>Location: GMT+1 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)</p><p>Please mail <a href='mailto:developers+so@simplepay.cloud' rel='nofollow'>developers+so@simplepay.cloud</a> - don't use the built-in submission functionality here. Please include a link to a specific open source contribution or an issue you logged (no matter how tiny or long ago) in the body of your email. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/250148?reset=False&amp;ra=1lTiocr98JP2&amp;oqs=a%3D1lTiocr98JP2' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About SimplePay</h3>            <div><p>SimplePay is a developer owned company providing online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore.

    "content": "<h2> Rails Developer </h2><div><div>BookingSync is more than a vacation rental solution for hosts and agencies; it is a platform for hundreds of applications and developers. We need an excellent engineer to take on the challenges of developing integration with multiple APIs from our partners, beautifully designed micro/macro-services, modeling complex domain and doing all that following TDD and writing a code of excellent quality.</div><div><br></div><div>We are growing fast and so are our requirements for scalability and stability. We are no longer at a scale where adding X number of servers solves all the issues. Database sharding, replicating data via message queues/distributed streams, optimizing response times in APIs to the max, integration with multiple services coming from our own ecosystem and numerous third-party services, and very soon dealing with big data - those are the things you can surely expect to be challenged by.</div><div><br></div><div>We are also a fully-remote async/distributed company across the entire world without a physical office. If traveling is your passion and you highly value location-independence, BookingSync is the right place for you.</div><div><br></div><div><b>2200€ - 4500€ + VAT / month on B2B contract + equity (real shares, not stock options)</b></div><div><br></div><div><strong>You will need to have:</strong></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Strong experience with Ruby on Rails</li><li>Proficiency in backend development in general</li><li>Solid design and architecture skills</li><li>Ability to demonstrate that with the right approach Rails can scale easily</li><li>Ability to communicate effectively with both internal and external development teams</li><li>Experience with relational databases and SQL (we're on Postgres). Experience with other databases will be a plus</li><li>A strong commitment to quality</li><li>Excellent written and spoken English</li><li>Experience with remote work and/or a solid work ethic that makes it possible to thrive in a remote-only environment</li><li>Care for the greater good, BookingSync is not just a software company, we give back to humanitarian, solidarity, environmental &amp; ecological causes from 10% to 50% of our profit.</li></ul><div><strong>It would be great if you had experience with:</strong></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Messaging solutions (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)</li><li>DDD/CQRS/ES, Clean Architecture</li><li>Contributing to development community through code, documentation, mentoring, teaching, speaking and all other forms</li><li>Short terms rentals or travel industry</li></ul><div><strong>Sounds interesting? Contact us now!</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Want to increase your chances of standing out? Include your open source contributions, blog posts and other publications you wrote, links to conference talks. You could even tell us about one thing or two you created that you are particularly proud of or the most challenging features you've worked on.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>The hiring process consists of four steps:</strong></div><div><br></div><div>1. A small homework: Imagine that you don't want to or just don't have enough time to go through entire Twitter, LinkedIn or Youtube feeds manually every day and you just want to have a quick way of getting the content under a given hashtag. Implement a Rails application where you can provide a list of hashtags in the input and as the result, a feed aggregating the content from Twitter, LinkedIn and Youtube feeds under these hashtags will be displayed (including headlines, videos, descriptions and whatever else that could be useful). Make the design flexible enough that would make it easy to add more sources in the future. Treat it as a real-world application (not just a prototype or a proof of concept) and send us a link to the repo.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Technical interview with remote pair-programming session with CTO: the interview part shouldn't take too much time - we are mostly interested in ability to solve the actual problems and being able to figure out the best possible solution for that problem, not in knowing things can be easily googled and learned through experience, that's why the interview part will be focused mostly on open-ended questions about some non-trivial matters. The pair-programming session will take a bit longer, and it will involve some nice challenge in a Rails universe.</div><div><br></div><div>3. An interview with our CEO and/or COO that will be focused more on soft things, nothing technical this time.</div><div><br></div><div>4. An opportunity to have the conversation with the entire team you are going to work with. It is an excellent way for both sides to make sure we will be a perfect mutual match.</div><div><br></div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more Programming jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Retail Zipline</span><br><span>Senior Rails Backend Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>U.S.A or Canada</span></a></li><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>G2i Inc.</span><br><span>Remote Contract React Native Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Contract</span><span>/</span><span>North and South America</span></a></li><li><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>G2i inc</span><br><span>Remote Contract React Native Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Contract</span><span>/</span><span>North America</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

Transportation technology is a hot market and we’re leading the charge, with raving fans and new customers signing up every day. We're looking for an experienced, driven, product-focused Senior Rails Engineer to help us deliver amazing features to our customers.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><b>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Your work will be heavily focused toward high level, high impact areas. You’ll work closely with Product Managers and Designers to plan, design, and implement some of our more complex features. You’ll have a strong voice in the development and planning processes, so prior senior level experience is key.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We work in weekly sprints and use Pivotal Tracker to keep things organized. While we keep meetings to a minimum, our remote team is heavily collaborative and takes advantage of modern tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Zoom to stay in touch.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our stack includes Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Postgres and Heroku. We’re currently on Rails 5.1 and strive to keep our frameworks and libraries up to date.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>This is a position we consider essential to the company’s success. Be sure to mention coffee in your application so we know you actually read this.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><b>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU</b></div><div><br></div><div></div><ul><li><span></span>Be a part of an incredible team of “A” players who go above and beyond to make Fleetio a successful company.

Crafting a delightful user experience is hard work, but we welcome the challenge and are looking for team members who share our ambition.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We’re a startup that’s in “scale up” mode, meaning we’re past the days of just a couple of people in a small office, but we’re still very much a fast-paced, highly collaborative company.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>Our top goal as product engineers is adding value to our customers and we love to get changes out quickly. We've optimized our CI/CD to make it painless to run our test suite and get code into our production Heroku environments easily, resulting in an average of 40 deploys per week.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>We place great value on work/life balance and abhor the stereotypical 100 hour/week startup life.

That is why we talk about technology that matters. The key focus in this is not the technology, but the way in which it is used on a day-to-day basis. The distinctive aspect of the solutions of Nedap is that new technologies are processed in a creative and innovative way into elegant, user-friendly products.<br><br>In addition to detailed knowledge of technological developments, Nedap also has a deep insight into various market segments. Nedap has different business units, so called market groups, each of which focuses on its own market. Each market group is responsible not just for the development of its products, but also for their marketing and sales.<br><br>Because each business unit functions as an independent enterprise, this results in balanced combinations of technology, products and businesses targeted at a specific market. By making smart use of the knowledge and experience of other market groups, products are developed and launched on the market more quickly; this is a major reason for our competitive strength<br><br>Nedap offers its employees the opportunity to be entrepreneurs in technology that matters. Thanks to the horizontal organisation structure, it is not your place in the hierarchy that matters, but the quality of your arguments. Initiative, perseverance and personal entrepreneurship are crucial in this. At Nedap, personal entrepreneurship means taking responsibility and converting ideas into action.&nbsp;<br><br>The N.V.
