    "content": "<p>Loco2 is an online booking service for train travel throughout the UK and Europe. Our mission is to make booking trains anywhere in Europe as easy and affordable as possible, from epic international adventures to everyday local commutes. </p><p>We’ve been selling tickets since 2012 and having reached market leader status, we recently became part of the Voyages-sncf group. We remain operationally independent but this partnership has given us the resources to get to the next stage of our journey.</p><p><strong>About us</strong></p><p>We're a <a href='https://loco2.com/team' rel='nofollow'>close-knit, passionate and cosmopolitan team</a>, and care deeply about building an inclusive, open and supportive work environment. We have a flexible location-agnostic approach to hiring, which means we hire the best person for the job, regardless of geography. Our team is spread across eight countries and we’re growing fast! </p><p>Our success is built on trust, empathy and shared knowledge, with both customers and colleagues at the centre of what we do. <a href='https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/loco2.com' rel='nofollow'>We're proud to have an average rating of 9.3 out of 10 on Trustpilot</a> after over 30,000 reviews and a <a href='https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Overview/Working-at-Loco2-EI_IE1950853.11,16.htm' rel='nofollow'>4.9 out of 5-star rating</a> on Glassdoor! </p><p><em>Why join us?</em></p><ul><li>Freedom: base yourself in our bright, modern office in central London or take advantage of our remote-friendly culture by working from home.</li><li>We offer flexible hours: work around your schedule and when you’re most productive.</li><li>Our team enjoys a healthy work-life balance and don’t think caffeine-fuelled all-nighters are a good way to grow a company that’s built to last.</li><li>Team activities: Developer conferences, annual retreats and monthly Lunch &amp; Learns.</li><li>We have high coding standards, and follow best practices such as continuous testing and delivery.</li><li>We strive to learn and improve together in a supportive environment as the wider tech ecosystem evolves.</li><li>Our days are not full of meetings and distractions. Allowing others to achieve flow is a big part of supporting each other.</li><li>Everyone is encouraged to ask questions, think creatively and suggest new working practices. We have a small team so your voice will be heard.</li></ul><p>We believe that diversity of background and experience contributes to a broader collective perspective that will consistently lead to a better company and better products. We are working hard to increase the diversity of our team wherever we can and we actively encourage everyone to consider becoming a part of it.</p><p><strong>Role description and tech stack</strong></p><p>We’re hiring experienced Ruby engineers to join our existing team, where you'll help us maintain and improve our existing infrastructure, integrate new rail operator booking systems and scale effectively for our rapidly expanding user base.</p><p>Our software stack consists of a pure-Ruby backend library which we use to communicate with train booking APIs, a modern Rails application, a PostgreSQL database, and two native mobile applications (iOS and Android).</p><p>We’re integrated with multiple rail operator booking systems (with our current team we usually complete at least 1-2 major integrations each year), and we’re increasingly consuming other types of data too (e.g. timetable data for routing, real-time arrivals/departures etc).</p><p>We need to diligently manage technical complexity, as each external system works in a slightly different way, with its own features and quirks. SOAP is (unfortunately) used by many operator APIs, which is why we released our open source library, <a href='https://github.com/loco2/lolsoap' rel='nofollow'>LolSoap</a>.</p><p>Some of the most difficult challenges we face relate to routing and making sense of lots of data. Which routes are best to get from A to B? Which booking systems should be queried? How might we cache data without affecting the accuracy of results?</p><p>We’ve recently released mobile applications for iOS and Android. Further developing our mobile strategy is a key goal for the business.</p><p>Because Loco2 is the merchant of record for all transactions we are also responsible for fraud prevention, and handling currency and other finance-related issues.</p><p>We frequently release new features that drive rapid organic growth, and so it’s vital that we anticipate and address scaling challenges before they occur.</p><p><strong>About you</strong></p><p>An ideal candidate:</p><ul><li>Has 4+ years of professional programming experience</li><li>Has deep knowledge and experience of Ruby</li><li>Is fluent in English and confident communicating and sharing complex information and learnings with both technical and non-technical team members</li><li>Has a good working knowledge of modern devops technologies such as Docker</li><li>Is comfortable designing object oriented software from scratch, not just implementing CRUD Rails apps; a pragmatist who can see the trade-offs involved in the different approaches to solving a problem</li><li>Strives to discover and understand the root cause of problems, suggesting new and improved solutions, rather than treating the symptoms</li><li>Actively considers future maintainability when deciding how to implement something</li><li>Has a keen appetite for self-improvement and growth, but doesn't hesitate to ask for help when needed</li><li>Enjoys getting their teeth stuck into complicated problems, as well as being willing to pitch in on some of the more routine tasks which inevitably arise</li><li>Is willing to participate in an on-call rota to cover technical emergencies out of hours</li><li>Can work hours that have some overlap with London daytime</li><li>Is motivated by Loco2's mission</li></ul>",

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of the development team building our content management system(CMS) that powers our mobile and web applications. &nbsp;You will get to come to work everyday knowing you are helping educate millions of people all around the world.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned JavaScript developer and have a solid knowledge of modern JS frameworks.</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Vue.js, Postgres, Heroku and Rails.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and PTO.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p><p>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a web app, node package or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p><p><strong>Life at HLT</strong></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Remote working</li><li>Flexible hours</li><li>Large amounts of autonomy</li><li>Great pay, insurance, benefits</li></ul><p><strong>So Why HLT?</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in</p><ul><li>Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks</li><li>Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education</li><li>A fast paced and fun work environment</li><li>A career with a higher purpose</li></ul><p>Then we we would love to talk to you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/196220?reset=False&amp;ra=13NYEKqt7OyA&amp;oqs=a%3D13NYEKqt7OyA' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large amounts of autonomy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great pay, insurance, benfits</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

    "content": "_About SpeechKit_    <br /><br />SpeechKit is a fast-growing audio-as-a-service product for news publishers. We are building a complete toolkit to assist in the production, distribution and monetisation of audio content that will help digital news publishers reach new audiences and engage existing subscribers.<br /><br />Our business is reaching an inflection point and we are quickly onboarding new publishers by the day. This business is quickly evolving into an exciting new provider of a brand new format of news.<br /><br />We are a lean team in a phase of consolidation. This is an opportunity to join an early stage business in a high growth market providing the first of its kind service.<br /><br />_The Role_<br /><br />We are looking for a mid-level engineer with experience in leading a team in building B2B Saas products. Whilst the role is for the lead engineer in our team, we are looking for a candidate that not only has experience across our stack but also shows a willingness and enthusiasm to lead our product development through this exciting phase. <br /><br />The role will involve, but not be limited to, the following; <br /><br />* Helping define the product roadmap alongside CEO and COO.<br />* Ownership and responsibility for technical product development.<br />* Hands-on technical development across the stack.<br />* Leadership and management of the technical team.<br /><br />We currently rely heavily on contractual work for the majority of our development. It will be your job to transition from this model and lay the foundations for a team capable of sustaining our growth through the following years.<br /><br />_Core technology stack experience:_<br /><br />* Ruby on Rails 5.<br />* Python (RSS/URL text extraction).<br />* PHP (WordPress plugin development).<br />* Javascript, HTML, CSS.<br />* PostgreSQL.<br />* ELK (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana).<br />* AWS, DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, Heroku.<br /><br />_What would make you stand out;_<br /><br />* Experience and interest in machine learning and speech synthesis.<br />* Google NLP API expertise.<br />* Audio encoding know-how (ffmpeg and HLS).<br />* Background in statistics.<br />* Voice/sound design experience.<br />* Experience with media players and advertising standards e.g., VAAST and DAAST.<br />* Experience with smart speaker technology e.g., Alexa and Google Home.<br />* Mobile SDK development.<br />* React Native.<br /><br />_More about SpeechKit_<br /><br />We are a young team who have been chasing a vision for on-the-go audio news for the best part of a decade. The two founders have 10 years experience running startups between them and Speechkit is an evolution of two previous startups that has moulded a business we believe to have hit a sweet spot in an emerging market. <br /><br />We launched an MVP product in March this year and have experienced 30% growth month-on-month since that launch. We are now entering a phase of consolidation of the product, marketing and business process to ensure steady growth into the next phase of the business. <br /><br />We are well funded and ready to scale the team and business to mirror our growth prospects. Currently, we are working semi-remote and will be taking office space in mid-September. This role will be location flexible, meaning you will, for the most part, be able to manage your time working from the location of your choice or have a desk at the office. <br /><br />_Salary and Perks_<br /><br />This is an opportunity to join a dynamic and exciting business at its inception. We are looking to at a base salary for this role of £65,000 and will make judgements on an increase if expertise expands into relevant fields. Share options will also be negotiated after 3 months of the role. Holiday will start at 25 days, with flexible working location conditions. We will endeavour to meet any other suggestions you have for the role and its rewards.",

    "content": "We’re looking for an experienced Rails developer to work on the software platform that powers our conferences and meetups, and supports our growing community of software developers.<br /><br />*Who are you?*<br /><br />You’re a senior software developer with strong experience building and running Ruby/Rails applications, looking for a role that puts you right at the heart of the software community.<br /><br />You’ll play a key role in maintaining and improving our existing applications, and help to shape our technology strategy.<br /><br />We’re not looking for a rock star, we’re looking for somebody who wants to be part of a great team - pairing, mentoring, collaborating. <br /><br />When things break, we’ll fix them together. When we ship great stuff, we’ll celebrate together!<br /><br />*What’s our tech stack?*<br /><br />Our platform is Rails 4, PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch and Redis. The web frontend is Zurb Foundation, jQuery and CSS3.<br /><br />Code is in GitHub, our build pipeline runs on CircleCI and all our production systems run on Heroku, monitored using Logentries, Rollbar and NewRelic.<br /><br />Ideally, you know what all those things are and you’ve worked with most of them. Maybe you already have some ideas about how we could use them more effectively.<br /><br />We’ve also got standalone projects ranging from visualization tools built using React and Rails APIs, to a bespoke pipeline for deploying Go apps to Raspberry Pi touchscreen devices around our venue.<br /><br />*How we work*<br /><br />We aspire to be agile and test-driven - but we’re also pragmatists who try not to get too hung up on textbook definitions. <br /><br />On Monday mornings we review work in flight, pick up new stories, and decide what our focus for the week is going to be. We work on short-lived feature branches, we write unit and integration tests. We merge code as soon as it’s been reviewed and we deploy to production several times a day. On Friday afternoons, we review progress and share ideas for what we could do differently next time.<br /><br />*What’s it like working here?*<br /><br />With four developers and two product owners, we’re still a relatively small development team, but we’re part of a diverse, enthusiastic company of around fifty people (growing to 150 in the next 18 months) hailing from all over the world.<br /><br />You’ll be working at our office in Liverpool Street, London. Our core hours are 9am-6pm, Monday-Friday. We’re fine with occasional remote working, but one of the great advantages of working here at CodeNode is the opportunity to engage directly with our community and participate in our events, so we’d prefer developers to spend most of their working days on site.<br /><br />You will also get unrivalled access to some of the best tech events in the world. CodeNode regularly hosts world-class speakers and experts from across the entire technology spectrum, and we organise hundreds of free community meetups every year.<br /><br />*Why join our team?*<br /><br />●       Allotted significant personal training year budget for learning and development<br /><br />●       Weekly 4-hour continuous learning session about your area of interest.<br /><br />●       Flexible working hours, possible to combine work from office and from home<br /><br />●       22 days annual holiday, increasing by one day per year to a maximum of 27 days per year<br /><br />●       Contributory pension (up to 2.5%)<br /><br />●       Participate in the company private health scheme with subsidised gym membership<br /><br />●       Cycle to work scheme<br /><br />●       Smartphone allowance <br /><br />●       Childcare vouchers<br /><br /> <br />*Who are we?*<br /><br />We are a community of software craftsmen and women, with a passion for tackling complex engineering challenges, and for sharing our skills and experience with others. <br /><br />With 140,000+ passionate, experienced, and highly engaged members, we're one of Europe’s largest software developer communities.Skills Matter organise some of the largest technical conferences in the UK, including FullStack, DroidCon, ScalaX and many more.<br /><br />Every day, hundreds of us get together at our venue CodeNode which is the UK's largest venue designed for technology events. <br /><br />A buzzing hive of activity, CodeNode provides 23,000 sq. ft of community meet-up, conference, training and collaboration space with unrivalled technology capabilities and great transport links in the heart of Tech City and the financial district.<br /><br />At CodeNode, we run hundreds of training courses and meetups every year, and our website hosts over 7,000 hours of videos covering topics from software architecture and distributed systems to diversity and digital product management.<br /><br />*Our process*<br /><br />When it comes to our hiring process, we’re flexible. <br /><br />We collaborate using Slack, email, GitHub, video calls, and screen sharing as well as face-to-face conversations; we can use any of those as part of our hiring process, and we’re happy to do things at a time that suits you to accommodate work commitments or time zone differences.<br /><br />First, contact us, - tell us who you are, what you’ve done, and why you think you’d be a good fit. If you have got a CV, include it.<br /><br />If you’ve got them, include links to your GitHub profile, your open-source project, your blog, maybe even include links to conference or meetup talks that you’ve given.<br /><br />We’ll invite you to pair-program with one of our team for an hour or two, either here at CodeNode or via remote screen sharing. We’ll also want to meet you, introduce you to the team and show you around; we can combine this with a pair-programming session and a technical Q&A, or we can do those online first and then get together afterwards and chat about how it all went.<br /><br />If you’re the right person for us, we’ll do whatever we can to make this the right job for you, so get in touch and let’s chat.<br /><br /><br />*STRICTLY NO AGENCIES*<br /><br />You must be eligible to live and work in the UK to be considered for this role.<br /><br />We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, or disability status",

    "content": "This is a unique opportunity to become an influential member of a small engineering team located in Shepherd's Bush in West London. You will enjoy all of the benefits of working in a startup, the freedom to innovate, to explore new technologies and to use your experience and ideas to directly influence the business.<br /><br />*---- Why ClickMechanic ----*<br /><br />ClickMechanic is a marketplace for vehicle repairs. Our platform enables customers to acquire real-time industry-standard quotes for repairs (a first in Europe), services and diagnostics, and quickly book a vetted mechanic online. Our mission is to bring trust and transparency to car repair.<br /><br />Founded in 2012, the company has grown quickly to offer nationwide coverage and is backed by such institutional investors as 500 Startups and Forward Partners, and angel investors including the former CEO of JustEat and Chairman of Treatwell.<br /><br />Vehicle repair is a huge market, ripe for technology disruption. There are millions of consumers, tera- or even peta-bytes of potentially underused data, with an exceptional logistics infrastructure (parts distribution).<br /><br />*---- The Role ----*<br /><br />As a full-stack developer in a small team, you will work across all aspects of the product from architecture and DevOps to code reviews and tech support. Working alongside our CTO & Head of Engineering, you will deliver new features and continually improve our existing code.<br /><br />Technology underpins our entire business. We’ve built an industry-leading quote engine and mobile Mechanic App. We consume millions of rows of third-party automotive data and have implemented machine learning to improve the accuracy of our quotes.<br /><br />*---- Responsibilities ----*<br /><br />* Writing well-tested production code in Ruby and JavaScript.<br />* Refactoring and rearchitecting legacy code where appropriate to ensure you always leave it better than you found it.<br />* Reviewing code fairly and honestly; and receiving code reviews openly on each of your pull requests.<br />* Collaboration with business stakeholders to develop requirements and expectations.<br />* Collaboration with technical stakeholders to discuss constraints and opportunities.<br />* Monitoring our production systems and providing technical support to the business.<br />* Maintaining our development pipeline and toolchain.<br />* Innovation and self-led learning.<br /><br />*---- Our Technology ----*<br /><br />As a startup, we prefer open-source technologies. Our main app is built with Ruby (on Rails) and is hosted on Heroku and AWS. We use both PostgreSQL and SQL Server relational databases and also MongoDB and Elasticsearch NoSQL databases.<br /><br />Our mobile Mechanic App is built on JQuery mobile and we are planning to rearchitect this system onto a more modern framework (e.g. React) soon.<br /><br />Our development pipeline utilises Jira, Git, GitHub, Docker, Webpack, Grunt and CircleCI.<br /><br />*---- Requirements ----*<br /><br />Your potential is much more important to us than a list of characteristics. Nevertheless, here is a list of characteristics that we hope already apply to you, or that you’re very keen to develop:<br />* You consider yourself fairly expert in at least one OO programming language (not necessarily Ruby).<br />* You have built a production web application using an MVC (or equivalent) framework (e.g. Ruby on Rails).<br />* The terms OOP, SOLID and TDD make you feel warm inside.<br />* You can write complicated SQL statements directly in the console without a query designer.<br />* Unix, Linux, Heroku, GitHub and NoSQL are not just made-up words to you.<br />* You can describe JavaScript as a functional, prototypal language and know what that means.<br />* You have strong Git-fu and can perform interactive rebases from the command line.<br />* You’re not afraid to get stuck into DevOps and have a go at, say, implementing Docker in a CI pipeline.<br />* You write your best code when pair-programming with another developer regardless of their experience.<br />* You wouldn't write a line of production code without writing a failing test first, because that’s how it’s done, right?<br />* You read about programming and technology because it’s a passion, not just a profession.<br />* You see legacy code as an exciting opportunity to innovate and make things better.<br /><br />*---- Benefits ----*<br /><br />* Working with leading open-source technologies in an agile team.<br />* A culture that embraces flexibility, and rewards growth and innovation.<br />* The opportunity to directly contribute to the success of the business every day.<br />* A competitive package including company pension and share options.<br />* MacBook Pro as standard.<br />* 10% innovation time.<br />* Manage your own training budget.<br />* Tea, coffee, fruit, snacks and Friday beers provided!<br />* Bringing trust and transparency to an industry which is widely recognised for high levels customer dissatisfaction.",
