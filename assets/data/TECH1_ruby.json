Introduce yourself to us as a colleague. Show us your future here! We value great writers, so be yourself, be creative. Stock cover letters won’t do. Tell us why you want this job.

Each of our apps has a dedicated team of designers and developers who are committed to refining and expanding their specific app in response to real customer needs. Our customers include over 90 of the 100 largest churches in the country, but also tens of thousands of small community and neighborhood churches, and we strive to make day-to-day operations easier for all of them.</p><p>We’re a development driven company — over half our staff are either developers or designers who code, and even our founder spends much of his time programming — and we’re seeking another developer with expertise in Ruby, Rails, and React to help make our software even better.</p><p><strong>Developers at Planning Center are:</strong></p><ul><li>Invested. We care about the products we create and the people we create them for, and we all contribute to the vision and direction of our apps. Every one of our developers is critical to their team.</li><li>Curious. We aren’t afraid to ask questions, experiment, and iterate. We also love playing with fun new technologies, and we have Free Weeks every few months for exploring projects that spark our interest.</li></ul><ul><li>Humble. We are always looking for opportunities to grow and learn from one another.</li></ul><p>We believe the strongest teams are made up of people with diverse backgrounds and experiences, and we are committed to cultivating that diversity here at Planning Center. We are ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do your best work.</p><p><strong>In your daily life at Planning Center, you could expect to:</strong></p><ul><li>Take ownership of your projects and have a voice in how to best complete them</li><li>Collaborate with your product manager, front-end designer, and fellow app team developers</li><li>Engage in an agile development process</li><li>Make coffee eight different ways in our rad coffee bar</li><li>…or, if you’re remote, drink coffee in a hip co-working space that we help pay for</li><li>Do work you’re proud of alongside a team of smart, thoughtful, like-minded developers</li></ul><p><strong>What to Expect If You Apply</strong></p><p>There’s no reason for this process to be an adventure full of unknown surprises! Here’s what you’re getting yourself into:</p><ol><li>Submit your resume.</li><li>We’ll have a quick and casual phone call (10-15 minutes) to introduce ourselves and to double check that this position is the type of position that you are interested in and could be a good fit for.</li><li>You’ll be sent a programming exercise covering the basics of the tech stack that we use at Planning Center (Ruby, Rails, and React). This is an opportunity for you to see a glimpse of the kind of work you’d be doing here, and for us to begin evaluating technical skills.</li><li>A live pair programming exercise with our team. There’s no whiteboards, and no typing! Someone from our team will type as the two of you work through a pair programming exercise together. You’ll get to meet another potential future co-worker, and we’ll get a glimpse into how you work as we make some tests pass together.</li><li>Pack your bags, you’re coming to San Diego! The final step is a day in our San Diego office where you’ll get to meet our leadership team and members of your potential new product team. It will be a full day of interviews with different people where we’ll both have lots of chances to find out if we’re a good fit for each other.</li><li>It’s offer time! Throughout all the previous steps, your expertise and experience have been assessed against our well defined developer levels and the salary amount of the offer will be decided solely based on that assessment. At Planning Center, every developer of the same skill level makes the same amount (plus a small bonus for seniority). We aim to pay at the 90th percentile for each level based on research from Payscale.</li></ol><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ol><li>Eligible to work in the United States.</li><li><strong>If remote, must be willing to travel to the office four times each year to connect with the rest of the team in person.</strong></li><li>Proven experience as a full stack developer (or similar role) using Ruby, Rails, and React.</li></ol><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p>We love our people and want this to be the best place for them to work. In addition to&nbsp;<strong>a competitive salary (starting between $100,000 – $150,000 depending on expertise),</strong>&nbsp;we offer:</p><ul><li>Full health, dental, and vision coverage</li><li>Company contribution to a 401(k)</li><li>Mobile phone allowance</li><li>Co-working stipend</li><li>Health stipend for counseling or a gym membership</li><li>Charitable giving match</li><li>Paid parental leave</li><li>Vacation and paid holidays</li><li>Paid Fridays off in the summer</li><li>Continual education allowance for books, videos, or conferences</li><li>Free weeks every several months to work on a project of your choosing</li></ul><p><strong>Gear</strong></p><p>The things you need to get your job done – laptop, monitor, standing desk, chair – all on us!</p><p><strong>Work from Anywhere in the USA</strong></p><p><strong>We are dedicated to hiring the best talent available; part of working at Planning Center is the option to work remote! We fly our remote team into the office once every quarter, so you can enjoy the nice California weather and connect with the rest of the team (75% of which is remote).</strong></p><p>If you’ve applied in the past, feel free to apply again!</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://pco.workable.com/j/F788093D08?viewed=true' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Each of our apps has a dedicated team of designers and developers who are committed to refining and expanding their specific app in response to real customer needs. Our customers include over 90 of the 100 largest churches in the country, but also tens of thousands of small community and neighborhood churches, and we strive to make day-to-day operations easier for all of them.\\n\\nWe’re a development driven company — over half our staff are either developers or designers who code, and even our founder spends much of his time programming — and we’re seeking another developer with expertise in Ruby, Rails, and React to help make our software even better.\\n\\n\\n### Developers at Planning Center are:\\n\\n**Invested.**&nbsp;We care about the products we create and the people we create them for, and we all contribute to the vision and direction of our apps. Every one of our developers is critical to their team. \\n\\n**Curious.**&nbsp;We aren’t afraid to ask questions, experiment, and iterate. We also love playing with fun new technologies, and we have Free Weeks every few months for exploring projects that spark our interest. \\n\\n**Humble.**&nbsp;We are always looking for opportunities to grow and learn from one another.\\n\\nWe believe the strongest teams are made up of people with diverse backgrounds and experiences, and we are committed to cultivating that diversity here at Planning Center. We are ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do your best work.\\n\\n### In your daily life at Planning Center, you could expect to:\\n\\n* Take ownership of your projects and have a voice in how to best complete them\\n* Collaborate with your product manager, front-end designer, and fellow app team developers\\n* Engage in an agile development process\\n* Make coffee eight different ways in our rad coffee bar\\n* ...or, if you’re remote, drink coffee in a hip co-working space that we help pay for\\n* Do work you’re proud of alongside a team of smart, thoughtful, like-minded developers\\n\\n### What to Expect If You Apply\\n\\nThere's no reason for this process to be an adventure full of unknown surprises! Here's what you're getting yourself into:\\n\\n1. Submit your resume.\\n2. We'll have a quick and casual phone call (10-15 minutes) to introduce ourselves and to double check that this position is the type of position that you are interested in and could be a good fit for.\\n3. You'll be sent a programming exercise covering the basics of the tech stack that we use at Planning Center (Ruby, Rails, and React). This is an opportunity for you to see a glimpse of the kind of work you'd be doing here, and for us to begin evaluating technical skills.\\n4. A live pair programming exercise with our team. There's no whiteboards, and no typing! Someone from our team will type as the two of you work through a pair programming exercise together. You'll get to meet another potential future co-worker, and we'll get a glimpse into how you work as we make some tests pass together.\\n5. Pack your bags, you're coming to San Diego! The final step is a day in our San Diego office where you'll get to meet our leadership team and members of your potential new product team. It will be a full day of interviews with different people where we'll both have lots of chances to find out if we're a good fit for each other.\\n6. It's offer time! Throughout all the previous steps, your expertise and experience have been assessed against our [well defined developer levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHCkuuwvTvFhr9N0eAQg9O4OUVAcCaejYqDe8eEnQyY) and the salary amount of the offer will be decided solely based on that assessment. At Planning Center, every developer of the same skill level makes the same amount (plus a small bonus for seniority). We aim to pay at the 90th percentile for each level based on research from [Payscale](https://payscale.com).\\n\\n\\n### Requirements\\n\\n1. Eligible to work in the United States.\\n2. If remote, must be willing to travel to the office four times each year to connect with the rest of the team in person.\\n3. Proven experience as a full stack developer (or similar role) using Ruby, Rails, and React.\\n\\n\\n### Benefits\\n\\nWe love our people and want this to be the best place for them to work. In addition to a competitive salary (starting between&nbsp;**$100,000 - $150,000**&nbsp;depending on expertise), we offer:\\n\\n* Full health, dental, and vision coverage\\n* Company contribution to a 401(k)\\n* Mobile phone allowance\\n* Co-working stipend\\n* Health stipend for counseling or a gym membership\\n* Charitable giving match\\n* Paid parental leave\\n* Vacation and paid holidays\\n* Paid Fridays off in the summer\\n* Continual education allowance for books, videos, or conferences\\n* Free weeks every several months to work on a project of your choosing\\n\\n### Gear\\n\\nThe things you need to get your job done - laptop, monitor, standing desk, chair - all on us!\\n\\n### Work from Anywhere in the USA\\n\\nWe are dedicated to hiring the best talent available; part of working at Planning Center is the option to work remote! We fly our remote team into the office once every quarter, so you can enjoy the nice California weather and connect with the rest of the team (75% of which is remote).\\n\\nIf you've applied in the past, feel free to apply again!  </div> </div>",

    "content": "At Planning Center, we build powerful, beautiful applications specifically for churches. Each of our apps has a dedicated team of designers and developers who are committed to refining and expanding their specific app in response to real customer needs. Our customers include over 90 of the 100 largest churches in the country, but also tens of thousands of small community and neighborhood churches, and we strive to make day-to-day operations easier for all of them.We’re a development driven company — over half our staff are either developers or designers who code, and even our founder spends much of his time programming — and we’re seeking another developer with expertise in Ruby, Rails, and React to help make our software even better.### Developers at Planning Center are:**Invested.** We care about the products we create and the people we create them for, and we all contribute to the vision and direction of our apps. Every one of our developers is critical to their team.  **Curious.** We aren’t afraid to ask questions, experiment, and iterate. We also love playing with fun new technologies, and we have Free Weeks every few months for exploring projects that spark our interest.  **Humble.** We are always looking for opportunities to grow and learn from one another.We believe the strongest teams are made up of people with diverse backgrounds and experiences, and we are committed to cultivating that diversity here at Planning Center. We are ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do your best work.### In your daily life at Planning Center, you could expect to:* Take ownership of your projects and have a voice in how to best complete them* Collaborate with your product manager, front-end designer, and fellow app team developers* Engage in an agile development process* Make coffee eight different ways in our rad coffee bar* ...or, if you’re remote, drink coffee in a hip co-working space that we help pay for* Do work you’re proud of alongside a team of smart, thoughtful, like-minded developers### What to Expect If You ApplyThere's no reason for this process to be an adventure full of unknown surprises! Here's what you're getting yourself into:1. Submit your resume.2. We'll have a quick and casual phone call (10-15 minutes) to introduce ourselves and to double check that this position is the type of position that you are interested in and could be a good fit for.3. You'll be sent a programming exercise covering the basics of the tech stack that we use at Planning Center (Ruby, Rails, and React). This is an opportunity for you to see a glimpse of the kind of work you'd be doing here, and for us to begin evaluating technical skills.4. A live pair programming exercise with our team. There's no whiteboards, and no typing! Someone from our team will type as the two of you work through a pair programming exercise together. You'll get to meet another potential future co-worker, and we'll get a glimpse into how you work as we make some tests pass together.5. Pack your bags, you're coming to San Diego! The final step is a day in our San Diego office where you'll get to meet our leadership team and members of your potential new product team. It will be a full day of interviews with different people where we'll both have lots of chances to find out if we're a good fit for each other.6. It's offer time! Throughout all the previous steps, your expertise and experience have been assessed against our [well defined developer levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHCkuuwvTvFhr9N0eAQg9O4OUVAcCaejYqDe8eEnQyY) and the salary amount of the offer will be decided solely based on that assessment. At Planning Center, every developer of the same skill level makes the same amount (plus a small bonus for seniority). We aim to pay at the 90th percentile for each level based on research from [Payscale](https://payscale.com).### Requirements1. Eligible to work in the United States.2. If remote, must be willing to travel to the office four times each year to connect with the rest of the team in person.3. Proven experience as a full stack developer (or similar role) using Ruby, Rails, and React.### BenefitsWe love our people and want this to be the best place for them to work. In addition to a competitive salary (starting between **$100,000 - $150,000** depending on expertise), we offer:* Full health, dental, and vision coverage* Company contribution to a 401(k)* Mobile phone allowance* Co-working stipend* Health stipend for counseling or a gym membership* Charitable giving match* Paid parental leave* Vacation and paid holidays* Paid Fridays off in the summer* Continual education allowance for books, videos, or conferences* Free weeks every several months to work on a project of your choosing### GearThe things you need to get your job done - laptop, monitor, standing desk, chair - all on us!### Work from Anywhere in the USAWe are dedicated to hiring the best talent available; part of working at Planning Center is the option to work remote! We fly our remote team into the office once every quarter, so you can enjoy the nice California weather and connect with the rest of the team (75% of which is remote).If you've applied in the past, feel free to apply again!",

You will coach them toward their growth goals or learn amazing things from them depending on the day and the technology you’re working with, work with them and the rest of the Bellroy team to understand (and contribute to) the businesses needs and, in our agile environment, help the team ship all of the things!</p><p>You will have plenty of time to write code, but (in this role) we’re looking for someone who gets at least as excited about growing and developing their people, their team’s practices &amp; processes, and in making sure that the things your team ships are&nbsp;<em>actually useful</em>&nbsp;(rather than technically what the story description said) as we are in someone who can write excellent code on their own. We also have technical leads who focus on technical reviews, code quality and our enterprise architecture strategy – and you’re welcome to jump in on those things too. We need enough technical leaders to build an innovative yet stable platform. And enough people leaders to help the team learn and grow. We make a clear distinction between these two streams because if you’re a great developer, managing people should not be your only path to career progression.</p><p>The majority of our current codebases are in pure Ruby or Ruby on Rails, so you must have at least a working understanding of those technologies. We use React and Elm in the front-end, and we’re starting to move more toward the latter. We’re working toward a headless e-commerce model and re-assessing our technical stack. You will have opportunities to learn and master new programming languages and frameworks (we’re leaning towards Haskell, and have deployed our first production system in it).</p><p>A quick note: We’re currently advertising a number of roles, so if this one doesn’t quite tick all of your boxes, check out our Senior Technical Lead position, and if the job you really wish we were advertising is some combination of these advertised roles, apply anyway. As part of your application tell us what you’re really looking for.</p><p><strong>YOU COULD BE THE ONE, IF YOU…</strong></p><ul><li>Have a solid technical background in a web application stack like Ruby on Rails</li><li>Get excited about great books and the ideas you can steal from them – technical and non-technical books alike</li><li>Understand and can argue the pros and cons of different software methodologies</li><li>Have experience leading and enjoy empowering other developers</li><li>Think a workplace with dogs, coffee, breakout spaces and casual dresscode sounds like a great place to be</li><li>Want to work for a company that cares about doing good things for the world</li></ul><p><strong>YOU PROBABLY AREN’T THE ONE, IF YOU…</strong></p><ul><li>Prefer working on your own, and staying away from face-to-face conversations (in that case consider applying for this Tech Lead role)</li><li>Care more about tabs vs spaces than Scrum vs Kanban</li><li>Are looking for a key role in technology selection and architecture (Tech Lead role)</li><li>Work just to pay the bills, no matter who is paying you or what you’re working on</li></ul><p><strong>WHY WORK FOR BELLROY?</strong></p><p>We have carefully built our culture on radical effectiveness. Our credo is “smart people with good intentions who get shit done” (yes, really). We have an awesome workplace in the heart of Fitzroy with free snacks and coffee (and a smaller workspace in Bells Beach).</p><p>Bellroy’s mission is to inspire better ways to carry; use business as a force for good; and help the world – and our crew – flourish. We make great carry products that delight people in their everyday lives. We help our staff love their work and grow as people. We donate a portion of our revenue to some of the world’s most effective charities. We are constantly looking for better ways to do… well, everything.

In order to build a cohesive and efficient product experience across the whole journey, we recently created a Growth team, as a sub-team of the larger Marketplace organization, to optimize the whole funnel from registration to lease.

There are so many interesting problems to solve around building and maintaining trust, creating efficiencies for different kinds of small, local businesses, creating transparency in the market – the list goes on and on.</span><br> </li><li> <span>Collaborating with our designers to understand our users and guide product decisions. Ultimately, every one of our users will interact with code you’ve written, so we hope you care deeply about their experience.</span><br> </li><li> <span>Improving our codebase.

We strive to be good at both giving and receiving code review.</span><br> </li><li><span>Helping to keep big projects on track without a lot of day-to-day intervention from managers. We’re looking for engineers who take a holistic view of what they’re working on and are more than just ticket-takers.</span></li><li> <span>We're currently piloting a workflow modeled on Basecamp's <i>Shape Up</i>&nbsp;book, and while we may not follow it to the letter once the pilot is over, we're looking for folks who would be excited to work in a system like that.</span><br> </li></ul><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span><b>Requirements</b></span></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><ul><li> <span>You’re an experienced developer who is comfortable working across the full stack of a modern, well-tested Ruby on Rails application.

We are trying to find ways to describe groups of people mathematically. Some groups with well defined structures are easy, such as a company, government or an army. Others are hard: such as a village, academia or an online community interested in bitcoin. We are interested in the latter.</p>  <p>We believe this project can open the doors to solving the fundamental problems in decentralized systems design.</p>  <p><strong>These will be your tasks</strong></p>  <p>As a backend developer you’ll be responsible for managing things like scheduling background tasks, building API routes for our clients, and collecting and storing data from other APIs for use in our algorithms, all the while logging and fixing errors along the way. If you like working with MVC’s transforming and moving data in creative and efficient ways, this if for you.</p>  <p>We are also constantly finding new scaling challenges as we collect more data and users and need to readjust deployment on our servers. We need to manage communication between services, backups, testing, as well as resource management such as memory.</p>  <p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Intermediate Python</li>   <li>A history of using MVC’s like Django or Rails</li>   <li>Basic MySQL</li>   <li>Docker</li>   <li>Be the type of person who is language independent and enjoys using new tech</li>   <li>Git</li>   <li>Basic crontab</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>AWS</li>   <li>NGINX</li>   <li>Kubernetes</li>   <li>Github and its services</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>We’re offering these benefits</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Work on hard &amp; fundamental problems</li>   <li>Equity options</li>   <li>Work from home or office or a cafe (whatever you prefer!)</li>   <li>Work visa sponsorship to Germany (if you wish to relocate)</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>How we work</strong></p>  <p>We are mostly a distributed team of 5 and growing. Most of the team members are located in Europe.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Choose your location:</strong> It would be ideal for you to work with the team in Berlin and we are happy to sponsor a German Work Visa for you. If it is not possible for you to work from Berlin we can also offer that you work remotely.</li>   <li><strong>Regular off-sites:</strong> At least every quarter we make a point for the team to meet in person and work together for a couple of days. We typically rent a big house where we live and work for several days.</li>   <li><strong>Communication:</strong> We use the following tools at work: Slack for instant messaging Asana for task management Standup Alice (Slack bot) for weekly stand-ups 1:1 calls on per need basis</li>   <li><strong>Working time:</strong> We currently do not track your hours worked (eg. Mon-Fri 9-5) however we do expect you deliver results on tasks. We do expect that you will be available on Slack in the afternoon, Central European Time (GMT+1).</li>   <li><strong>Office:</strong> Most of us currently work remotely from home, cafés etc. and you are welcome to do the same. If you work with us in Berlin you can join us in our coworking space to get more of an “office culture”.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Culture of Critical Thinking</strong></p>  <p>One of the biggest risks we face is that we can fool ourselves into believing that we got something to work when we in fact did not. This is because verifying accuracy of our algorithm’s outputs takes a long time and significant infrastructure. This means that an experiment that was not well-thought through enough can lead us to wasting months of work. We cannot afford that. For this reason, it is essential that we build a culture around critical thinking and closely follow the scientific method.</p>  <p>If you are not familiar with Critical Thinking &amp; the Scientific Method, we encourage you to watch the following videos before having a chat with us:</p>  <p>Critical Thinking Course</p>  <p>Richard Feynman discussing the Scientific Method</p>  <p><strong>Big no-no’s</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Calls to authority (“I’ve been doing this for 20 years and you’re just an intern, we’ll do it my way”; “world’s top experts agree that…”)</li>   <li>Discrediting ideas based on their public perception (“If you think that you are a X, Y, Z”)</li>  </ul>  <p>Please include your GitHub account or some kind of portfolio of works within your CV/resume.</p> </div><a href='https://hive.join.com/jobs/292604-backend-developer?pid=98c1261599ca17c51388&amp;utm_source=berlinstartupjobs&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=singlepostingstandard&amp;utm_content=backenddeveloper' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this position</a>",

You can when you work with us.</p><p>We are looking for a talented person to come onboard with our engineering department<strong>&nbsp;to work from home in the position of a Ruby on Rails Engineer.</strong>&nbsp;You’ll take on the challenge of improving the customer experience and overall efficiency of Empire Flippers, working alongside the VP of Engineering James Andrews, the CEO Joe Magnotti and the rest of the engineering team.</p><p>This is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth—and there is no sign of it slowing down. In order to keep hitting our goals, including our 2019 goal of $42 million-worth of businesses sold, we need to expand our horizons and improve our customer experience to a point that makes us the de-facto standard for buying and selling online businesses. Your work will help propel the industry forward to new levels not seen before and you’ll be gracefully rewarded for doing so.</p><p><strong>Being a location-independent full time position is one of the many benefits – you’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best, be it the beaches in Thailand, which does have superb 4G connectivity and cheaper cost of living, or in a mountain resort in the Swiss alps – the choice is yours.</strong></p><p><strong>Compensation for this position is US$70-90k per annum depending on experience, plus medical insurance and unlimited vacation time.</strong></p><p>If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position!</p><p><strong>What’s Our Story?</strong></p><p>Empire Flippers started in 2011. Back then, we were known as the AdSense Flippers, and we were all about building our own niche sites. We would monetize those sites via Google AdSense. Once the sites were making a little money, we would sell them on Flippa for 20x their net monthly profit.</p><p>We recorded our entire journey by blogging all about it.</p><p>It was a nice little business and soon we built quite a following of people who loved what we were up to. It got to the point where people asked us if we would use our Flippa account to sell their sites. They told us it would sell easier since we had the audience, and they would pay us a percentage of the sale.</p><p>So… we said yes.</p><p>It wasn’t long before we were selling way more of other people’s sites than our own.</p><p>We realized there was something here. Something big.</p><p>In 2012, we rebranded to Empire Flippers and became an online business brokerage in our own right. We launched our marketplace and became the “go-to” solution for people wanting to sell their online businesses.</p><p>Fast forward to today, we now have the largest brokerage team in the industry. We have staff that is siloed for each part of the selling and buying process — everyone from marketing and sales team members, to vetting and migration experts.</p><p>Now, we’re inviting you to become part of our story.</p><p><strong>What’s the Opportunity?</strong></p><p>Becoming a Rails Engineer makes you a critical part of Empire Flippers. You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world.</p><p>We’ll teach you the ins and outs of the online business brokerage industry, coming from years of experience. You’ll work on improving the customer journey, which should be flawless, pain free and easy to navigate. For many of our customers it is the first time either buying or selling an online business, which can be an incredibly anxious and confusing moment in their lives. You’ll be helping them directly by providing them with an easy to use interface that just makes sense.</p><p>This is a full time position – our company is growing at a fast rate, which means excellent opportunities for personal and career growth.&nbsp;<strong>We may ask you to attend conferences too,</strong>which can help you network with industry leaders.</p><p><strong>What’s the Rails Engineer Position Like?</strong></p><p>What’s the Position Like?</p><p>The Ruby on Rails Engineer position is vital to the success of our company.</p><p>You’ll use your initiative in implementing API’s and integrations to address our business needs along with the rest of the engineering team. Both our clients and staff will be using the software you write. Our small and close knit engineering team currently consists of a UX specialist, 2 frontend engineers, one backend engineer, one WordPress engineer and several QA specialists. You’ll work closely with the team to implement solutions for all departments within Empire Flippers, be it compliance, customer support, sales and migrations. You’ll work closely with the frontend and WordPress engineers to ensure features are implemented correctly to the highest standard, and you’ll work closely with one more backend engineer to ensure scalability, speed, code cleanliness and readability.</p><p>The feature set will have already been decided on – it’s your responsibility to plough ahead with the implementation and to ensure the user experience is elevated to unprecedented levels and ultimately, close more deals.</p><p><strong>What Skills Do I Need?</strong></p><p>We believe in hiring people that are a good fit for us culturally.</p><p>A good fit is actually more important to us than the skill set since we will teach you everything you need to know.</p><ul><li>You should have at least 5 good years of experience under your belt, having implemented some complex, data driven applications. Your portfolio speaks louder than your words.</li><li>You should be a ninja with every component of our tech stack. You must have a complete working knowledge of RoR in API mode, SQL, Postgres, Sidekiq, Rspec, Git, Redis.</li><li>Experience working with a wide range of 3rd party integrations. Our platform talks to many 3rd party applications, you should have experience building and maintaining such integrations in a test driven fashion.</li><li>Dev-ops/sysadmin skills. Experience with managing servers, maintaining hosting environments, being responsible for uptime and responsiveness, addressing bottlenecks, ensuring backups are kept safe and sound.</li><li>You need to have immaculate attention to detail. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if something doesn’t quite look or feel right, to the nearest code change and to the nearest hexadecimal color, to the point you become annoying to us. At times other developers may edit your code, you’ll be watching to ensure the code base remains readable, scalable and fast.</li><li>Be a good communicator. It sounds very cliché, but you’ll immerse yourself in almost every department, you’ll be learning problems and presenting solutions, and also overseeing the implementation of those solutions too.</li><li>A self-starter. We need to see some evidence that you’re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you’ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won’t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day to day basis, you’ll be working in almost full autonomy, we’ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. We don’t believe in micro-management.</li></ul><p><strong>The following skills/experience would be a bonus, but not required:</strong></p><ul><li>React. Our client code is written in React. Being able to navigate the front-end code and patch things up would be a huge bonus.</li><li>PHP/WordPress. We will be interfacing with WordPress significantly, being able to speak the same language would be great.</li><li>Databases. A comprehensive experience working with various types of SQL and noSQL databases would be very useful. MySQL, Postgres, DynamoDB, Cassandra, to name a few.</li><li>Caching. The software we’re building needs to be fast and to remain fast as we scale, both in terms of traffic and database size. Having experience with Memcached, Redis, Varnish or experience with complicated CDN setups with many rules would be a plus.</li></ul><p><strong>What’s the Lifestyle Like?</strong></p><p><strong>Our company is built on the foundation of travel, remote work, and living life on your own terms.</strong></p><p>We’re not looking to put you in a cubicle and waste your time in traffic. You’ll be working hard, playing hard, and learning all about our company and what we stand for during this time.</p><p>Apart from meeting us in person every now and then, you’re free to work and live anywhere you’d like and join the new class of digital nomads – we’re homeless but have a passport, debit card and a laptop.</p><p>You’ll become friends with people who will be able to give you massive insights into how digital businesses work, how they scale, and, of course, how to invest in them or sell them.</p><p><strong>Love It. What’s the Catch?</strong></p><p>This isn’t a gap year experience. This is not a temporary contract.</p><p>If you’re applying just because you want something to fund your travels before you start seeking out a “serious” job, then you probably shouldn’t apply.</p><p>We’re looking for career-minded people who share our vision and see where we’re going. We want you to be part of that vision and help us get there over the long haul.</p><p>And while we play hard and sometimes really do work next to the pool all day, we work even harder. Sometimes you will be putting in a 10-12 hour day as business demands arise. You’ll be working weird hours to match other team members time zones, and you’ll sometimes have to face some critical feedback. And if there’s a bug in your code that’s blocking a multi-million dollar deal, expect a phone call at 3am.</p><p>You will be expected to perform to our expectations and really help us grow our business to the next level. We’re counting on you.</p><p>If you can see yourself growing into a profitable and meaningful career with us and love what we do, we want you to be part of our team.</p><p><strong>Details to Keep in Mind</strong></p><p>We’re going to start you off slow. You’ll first learn about our company and what each department does; then you will be given some low-level tasks to ease you into the position.</p><ul><li>For the first six months your role will be probationary, during which time your training and performance will be evaluated. Over time, your skills will grow and you’ll be making a lot of decisions on your own. However, you will always have our support and knowledge to lean on. We aren’t going to throw you to the wolves — you’ll be part of a high-functioning team that is here to help wherever we can.</li><li>Joe Magnotti and James Andrews will be reviewing every application. If we think you’re a good fit, we will reach out to you to do a video call interview. After the first interviews are done, our final candidates will be brought back for a final second interview before we make our decision.</li><li><strong>A background check is required before employment</strong></li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://empireflippers.com/career/ruby-on-rails-engineer/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

But we're always looking for ways to improve. People rarely work more than 40 hrs/wk and we spend&nbsp;0% of our time fighting fires.</p><p>There's no babysitting. You're in charge of yourself. That means you work where and when you want.</p><p>Culture is really important to us. But building culture in a remote team can be difficult. We do a lot of things to try to remedy that. Chief among them are our annual retreats. Last year our retreat was in Lisbon, Portugal. We had a hackathon, broke out of escape rooms, and ate lots of good food.</p><p>There's always something challenging to work and great people to spend your days with building things at Hubstaff.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible schedule</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote / Work from home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Job security / Long term</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Recognized for its consistent cooperation and collaboration with cities, Spin partners closely with transportation planners, elected officials, community groups, and university administrators to bring stationless mobility options to streets in a responsible and carefully orchestrated manner.</p>\n <p>Based in San Francisco, Spin is a diverse team of engineers, designers, urban planners, policymakers, lawyers and operators with experience from Y Combinator, Lyft, Uber, local and federal government, and the transportation advocacy world. Spin was known for launching the first stationless mobility program in Seattle, and has since expanded to become the exclusive electric scooter partner in mid-sized cities like Coral Gables, Florida and Lexington, Kentucky, and one of a few permitted scooter operators in large cities like Denver, Detroit, and Washington, D.C. The team embeds in cities and neighborhoods to understand their specific transportation needs, and hires locally from the community.</p>\n <p>Spin is expanding quickly and looking for top-tier talent to help us bring affordable and accessible transportation options to cities and define what future safe streets will look like.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>\n <p>We need backend engineers with proven experience in Rails.

While we’re all polyglots, we have a long love affair with Rails. We own our and deploy our code. We’re concerned about code clarity and communication, as we feel it’s the best measure of quality.</p>\n <p>We promote being a more well rounded engineer by working on different parts of the engineering stack. We also work in small groups to keep processes and overhead low, so we have a lot of trust and accountability to perform the work required to build the best product. We’re still working out the best processes for our team to thrive.</p>\n <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Collaborate with other teams to build and support server-side logic and interfaces that power our product and features</li>\n  <li>Write backend services and APIs</li>\n  <li>Build for scale, availability, performance and security across the stack</li>\n  <li>Extend our public API so developers and partners can take advantage of our platform</li>\n  <li>Deliver quality software through comprehensive code reviews and automated testing</li>\n  <li>Push your team forward onto the latest and greatest, be it engineering practices, libraries, tools or products</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Minimum of 3 years of relevant experience in backend development (Ruby on Rails, Go)</li>\n  <li>You have worked with a team of people to build an entire product end-to-end</li>\n  <li>You understand relational database systems and schema design</li>\n  <li>You have created and supported APIs</li>\n  <li>You have experience with how systems work at scale</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Benefits &amp; Perks</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Opportunity to join a fast-growing startup and help shape and establish the company’s industry leadership</li>\n  <li>Competitive health benefits</li>\n  <li>Unlimited PTO for salaried roles</li>\n  <li>Monthly commuter stipend plus pre-tax benefits</li>\n  <li>Monthly cell phone bill stipend</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/spin/456da83e-5958-451f-abdc-f94194e1f726' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

In the last few years, we’ve been to Austin, Orlando, New Orleans, San Diego, Las Vegas, and New York City.</p>\n <p>We think that these in-person meetings are vital to the success of a remote team.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Role</strong></p>\n <p>As a Serverside Developer at Files.com, you will take the lead on helping build cutting edge features into the Files.com product that drive value for the 1,700 business that use our platform for collaboration.</p>\n <p>Our API receives hundreds of requests per second and is used by both internal and external developers.</p>\n <p>Here are some examples of projects that our Serverside Developers will be tackling in the next 6-12 months:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Implementing Single-Sign-On via OAuth, SAML, and SCIM.</li>\n  <li>Implementing in-file search using Elasticsearch with custom input filters to index a plethora of document types.</li>\n  <li>Building a scalable engine that can convert nearly any type of files to PDF for in-browser previews (like the former Crocodoc service).</li>\n  <li>Upgrading our API documentation to be automatically generated using the OpenAPI standard, and the creation of automatically-generated SDKs.</li>\n  <li>Building our Universal Sync engine, which is a tool that allows Files.com users to synchronize their files to other cloud services such as S3, Azure, and Rackspace.</li>\n  <li>Building a file versioning tool that uses Git behind the scenes to give customers easy tracking of file versions.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Additionally, you’ll contribute to our ongoing projects for improving security, monitoring, and performance.</p>\n <p><strong>Minimum Qualifications:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>5+ years of directly applicable experience.</li>\n  <li>Strong Computer Science background and understanding of algorithms and data structures.</li>\n  <li>History developing and supporting actual applications that have seen production usage with a large userbase.</li>\n  <li>Complete understanding of how to write secure code and an awareness of common web application security vulnerabilities.</li>\n  <li>Experience with Ruby and Rails.</li>\n  <li>Appreciation for testing and the ability to write specs using RSpec.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Preferred Qualifications:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Participation in open source Ruby gem projects, including ideally being the maintainer for a Gem that sees large usage in the community.</li>\n  <li>Strong experience working at scale.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Our Core Beliefs</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Here are just some of our Core Beliefs:</strong></p>\n <p>We believe that the best Engineers tend to be polyglots with a wide variety of programming language experience.We don’t hire for specific programming language skills, but rather look for engineers who are fluent in several programming languages. We want our staff to be adaptable and ready to evolve to what’s next.</p>\n <p>We believe in using the right tool for the job. Our core applications are built in Ruby, JavaScript, Java, C++, and PHP. We use Rails, React, Chef, Qt, Jenkins, Github, Honeybadger, CircleCI, Maven, AWS, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, Haml, Sass, and many other exciting open source systems. We don’t want to get stuck in the trap of using a language or a tool just because “that’s how it’s done around here.”</p>\n <p>We believe that open-source only works if companies give back. If you work on any open-source projects during the course of your work at Files.com, you are encouraged to submit your improvements as a pull request back to the upstream project. And if you build something from scratch while working here that’s generic and not related to our core products, we want you to release that on GitHub too. We’ll also pay your travel costs to any conference where you can get a speaking gig.</p>\n <p>We believe in building products that we actually use ourselves. We are our own toughest critics and we put all of our products through their paces every day.</p>\n <p><strong>Salary, Pay, and Benefits</strong></p>\n <p>Files.com offers industry-leading salaries based on experience combined with unparalleled flexibility and other benefits to secure top talent.</p>\n <p>You’ll take off 11 company-wide holidays per year as well as 20 days of PTO for vacations. Go have fun. Don’t work all the time.</p>\n <p>We will provide you a $2,500 signing bonus to purchase a new computer, desk, or anything else that would help build or refresh your home office.</p>\n <p>We’ll update your salary annually based on your performance, as reviewed by your peers.</p>\n <p>We fully pay base plan health insurance premiums (exact plan details depend on your state of residence), and we’ll pick up the tab for 75% of your spouse or dependents if they wish to join your chosen plan. We want your family to be healthy.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://www.files.com/job-ads/ruby-developer' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications. \n  <br> \n  <br>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list. \n  <br> \n  <br>What You Will Be Doing \n  <br> \n  <br>You will be part of the development team building our web application platform. &nbsp;You will be&nbsp;&nbsp;helping educate millions of people all around the world. \n  <br> \n  <br>Who We Are Looking For \n  <br> \n  <br>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone&nbsp;bright&nbsp;with a proven track record in developing software for high&nbsp;quality,&nbsp;scalable&nbsp;applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward. \n  <br> \n  <br>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms \n  <br> \n  <br>* You are a seasoned JavaScript developer and have a solid knowledge of modern JS frameworks. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You work with a spirit of collaboration, especially with other teams, like design and marketing. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Other things that are helpful to know are Vue.js, Postgres, Heroku and Rails. \n  <br> \n  <br>How We Work \n  <br> \n  <br>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf. \n  <br> \n  <br>What We Pay \n  <br> \n  <br>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. \n  <br> \n  <br>Benefits \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Remote working \n  <br> \n  <br>* Flexible hours \n  <br> \n  <br>* Large amounts of autonomy \n  <br> \n  <br>* Great pay, insurance, benefits \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>So Why HLT? \n  <br> \n  <br>If you’re interested in \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks \n  <br> \n  <br>* Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education \n  <br> \n  <br>* A fast paced and fun work environment \n  <br> \n  <br>* A career with a higher purpose \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Then we we would love to talk to you! \n </div> \n</div>",

We’re convinced that we are able to solve the issues with duplicated listings, fake agents, and unqualified tenants/buyers. We are learning, and trying constantly to add value for our users and the agents wherever we can through different touchpoints, enabling them to make the right choice while maintaining the best user experience.\n<p>--JD--We're looking for Full Stack Developers who are familiar with Ruby on Rails, HTML and Javascript.If you've had experience with AWS, it will be a good bonus.</p>\n<p>We currently only accept applicants who are either currently residing in Malaysia or who are Malaysian citizens.

Noise</p>\n <p>Basecamp is hiring a Senior Programmer on our Security · Infrastructure · Performance team to help keep our products safe, reliable, and fast until the end of the Internet. <strong>We’re accepting applications for the next two weeks with a start date in early September.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>ABOUT THE JOB</strong></p>\n <p>You’ll pitch in on securing our Rails apps, scaling them to match their growth, keeping them fast, and ratcheting up their reliability &amp; robustness, end to end. You’ll develop internal tooling and systems that help our Ops, Support, and Data teams run the business day to day. You’ll groom a sweet, productive app-development experience that puts a premium on designer and programmer happiness. When someone pulls the Andon Cord, you’ll help get to the very bottom of it—and identify &amp; address the systems issue that led it.</p>\n <p>This position is systems, security, tooling, deep-dive debugging, framework-level Rails development, web performance, and internal support, through and through. Its hallmark: getting to the bottom of it. The work draws on a broad, lumpy mix of app/security/privacy/reliability/debug engineering expertise. You can expect to grow in your strengths, versatility, and competence in this job. You can expect an inclusive, eager team who’ll support you in it, rise to challenges with you, and grow together.</p>\n <p>Our product count outnumbers our headcount. Developing low-footprint, reliable, securable, operable, supportable apps is the prevailing wind in our sails. You will put out some fires, including incident response and remediation, but your focus will be reliability and robustness. Less-flammable apps; fewer smoldering embers; automated fire suppression. No heroics. This job isn’t about moving heaven and earth. Yes, we want to be proud of running top-flight, healthy products, but we also want to be kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. Especially in crisis.</p>\n <p><strong>Here are some real examples of the work we’ve done lately that might help you to get a better idea of what this job entails:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Creating Rails’ Active Storage framework and integrating it with our apps</li>\n  <li>Developing our GDPR privacy policy and rolling it out</li>\n  <li>Dealing with a credential stuffing attack from A to Z</li>\n  <li>Designing a live failover for cloud storage providers so we can tolerate catastrophic failure</li>\n  <li>Building an email tracing tool so our support team can help customers track down email delivery issues</li>\n  <li>Responding to a Rails security release by understanding the vulnerability, reproducing it, upgrading all apps, and backporting the fix to older versions of Rails</li>\n  <li>Figuring out why certain cache hit rates unexpectedly tanked after a deploy</li>\n  <li>Fielding a security researcher’s report of a security vulnerability, from validation to fix and awarding bounty</li>\n  <li>Evolving our hybrid Docker-based development environment to improve ergonomics for designers &amp; developers</li>\n  <li>Addressing stale reads and deadlocks among concurrent web requests and background jobs</li>\n  <li>Addressing invitation spam and signup fraud with heuristics devised in concert with our Data team</li>\n  <li>Working with our Ops team to gracefully move petabytes of cloud storage from provider A to provider B, with full app and Active Storage support</li>\n </ul>\n <p>This is a snapshot of <em>our</em> experience running production-grade apps and a capable, supportive team for the long haul. Your experience and background will join ours! We have worlds to learn and we’re eager to do it together. You can expect to teach us, coach us, and expect the same in return.</p>\n <p><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></p>\n <p>We’re looking for an experienced candidate who’s ready for a similar breadth and depth of work, but nobody hits the ground running. That’s a lot of different areas of responsibility! You won’t be able to answer every question immediately or know how all the systems work on day one, and we don’t expect you to. Solid fundamentals with software development, systems, troubleshooting, and teamwork pave the way.</p>\n <p>In broad strokes, Managers of One thrive at Basecamp. We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. We’re quick to trust. We see things through. We’re kind to each other, look up to each other, and support each other. We reach for responsibility and hold ourselves accountable. We show up for the work and for each other.</p>\n <p>We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. And understand the value in others being heard. We subject ideas to rigorous consideration and challenge each other, but all remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work. That comes with direct feedback, openness to each others’ experience, and willingness to show up for each other as well as for the technical work at hand. We’re in this for the long term.</p>\n <p>We want strong, diverse teams built from different backgrounds, experiences, and identities. We’re ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best work of your career. That starts with working no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis and getting 8+ hours of sleep a night. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.</p>\n <p>You can expect a mindful onboarding process with ramp-up and time to learn. You can expect a team that listens, and to be heard. You can expect to give and provide direct feedback. You can expect to be counted on. You can expect to do your best work and build a career here. We build our apps, our teams, and our company for the long haul, with a strong eye to other teams’ effectiveness &amp; happiness, from design to support and operations. A healthy, resilient app starts with a healthy, resilient organization.</p>\n <p>You might have a CS degree. You might not. That’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.</p>\n <p><strong>This is a remote job. You’re free to work where you work best, anywhere in the world: home office, coworking space, coffeeshops. </strong>While we currently have an office in Chicago, you should be comfortable working remotely—most of the company does! That hinges on effective writing and comfort with open communication. The bulk of our work is written, from pull request discussion to long-form proposals and team chats. <strong>We do require that your normal workday has at least 4 hours overlap with the Chicago workday (currently UTC-5) without impinging on your personal/family life. </strong>Our team spans UTC+2, UTC-4, UTC-5, UTC-7. The company as a whole works works from 30+ cities across 9 countries.</p>\n <p><strong>PAY AND BENEFITS</strong></p>\n <p>We benchmark our pay to the 90th percentile of San Francisco rates. Same position, same pay, no matter where you live: between $145,000 and $179,000, matched to your experience.</p>\n <p>Benefits at Basecamp are all about helping you lead a healthy life outside of work. We won’t treat your life as dead code to be optimized away with free dinners and dry cleaning. You won’t find lures to keep you coding ever longer. Quality time to focus on work starts with quality time to think, exercise, cook a meal, be with family and friends—time to yourself.</p>\n <p>Work can wait. We offer fully-paid parental leave. We work 4-day weeks through the summer (northern hemisphere), enjoy a yearly paid vacation, and take a one-month sabbatical every three years. We subsidize coworking, home offices, and continuing education, whether professional or hobbyist. We look out for our well-being with monthly support for CSA (locally grown produce), fitness, and massage. We match your charitable contributions. All on a foundation of top-shelf health insurance and a retirement plan with a generous match.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-is-hiring-a-senior-programmer/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",
