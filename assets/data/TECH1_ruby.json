We&rsquo;re a small team of 2 - a designer and a business/product/many-hats person - and a few contractors.</p><br /><p>Our goal is to build a pleasant work environment and a sustainable business. We are not looking to raise external funding for at least the next couple of years.</p><br /><p>Our focus right now is on Pixie (<a href='https://www.usepixie.com/'>https://www.usepixie.com</a>), a Basecamp-style SaaS for accountancy firms. We see a path to expand to other professional services down the line, like legal, etc. but currently this is the market segment we can understand better. Pixie&rsquo;s just launched and off to a great start, feedback is positive and encouraging.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re looking to bring in someone to work together with us (not for us) and lead the software engineering side.</p><br /><p>This is a hands-on, software engineering, with salary up to &pound;40,000-&pound;45,000p.a. which we are looking to increase in the first year as the business grows. We are also offering an equity stake. As part of the founding team, you&rsquo;ll have shared control of our products and roadmaps, get a direct line to customers, and exposure to as many aspects of the business as you want. And as we grow, we hope to work together in building a small engineering team around you.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><h1>About you</h1><br /><p>We need you to have demonstrable experience with these technologies:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Ruby on Rails 5, Omniauth + Devise, RSpec, Capybara, Apartment</li><br /><li>AWS infrastructure: EC2, IAM, RDS, S3, Elasticache, etc.</li><br /><li>PostgreSQL 10+, Redis</li><br /><li>Git, Gitlab (optional)</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>It'd be brilliant if you already have some Vue.js experience, but if you've done things in React that's just as well.</p><br /><p>On the non-technical side, you feel comfortable with the idea of working on a distributed team, being self-driven and asking questions.</p><br /><p>Ideally you have some interest in owning a small software company, but our main ask is for agreement towards our values:&nbsp;<a href='https://medium.com/pomarhq/pomars-guiding-principles-ca00356174ce'>https://medium.com/pomarhq/pomars-guiding-principles-ca00356174ce</a>.</p>",

Our software does job tracking, marketing, invoicing, integrates tons of online tools -- and is awesome. We are open to taking risks with technology, we use ember/react/kubernetes in production, and are generally open to exciting fun new stuff! We're building a company that has fun inventing. We go fast, and our customers love us. Thousands of repair shops and IT Professionals all over the world rely on our platform for their entire business operations. We are different - we really do care, the founders are writing this ad and looking at the resumes - not a recruiter or HR department. We are using heroku with 50+ dynos, our platform consists of a number of rails apps and integrations to other platforms. We hook into Google Cloud Print, we're building a huge inventory system to rival any out there, we've built a &quot;remote machine management&quot; platform with an open API, we're doing it all... If this sounds like the kind of team you want to be part of, we want to hear from you. Do you play around with new stuff for fun?Have any cool side projects to test out a new technology?Do you hear about a problem and just obsessed building a web app to solve it?If this sounds like your kind of play - we might be a great fit. :) HIGHLIGHTS: -Salaried position designed to grow with the company (seriously, try us).-We want this to be your dream job - but we need your help (tell us how).-We will advance your career like nobody else -- stay with us for the long haul and we'll keep you challenged, learning, passionate, and growing.-Results-oriented: Keep having fun and shipping code and you can design your day.-We are currently a dispersed team working from home and a few regional offices (Seattle, Bellevue, Bay Area). (WeWork - super cool space ) WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING: -Lots of building and inventing.-Helping discover and flesh out new product ideas. (Roadmap has like 1000 new features we're anxious to get to!)-Keeping us up to date with what you are learning in your spare time.-Bringing in new technology you discover that might solve a problem.-Coming up with improvements to many areas that are still sort of minimum viable state. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR: -A few years of building applications, designing interfaces, etc.-5+ years of Ruby on Rails -No specific education necessary. (really)-Excellent communication skills - verbal, written and electronic.-You care -- which means sometimes putting yourself out there for a customer experiencing pain.-Ability to multi-task in a fast paced environment.-You're kind and wily (in a good way). HOW TO GET HIRED BY US: Write us about a recent time or two that you caused a production outage, what the root cause was, and what you learned from it. For example; Troy our Founder shipped a typo in a class name a bit ago and those are annoying because they might be easily missed in Development environment but then production blows up. This led to a more robust CI+Staging step than we had prior. Just demonstrate that you are an individual, you have a personality, you enjoy life, and you enjoy good work. And please include a resume. :) SyncroMSP is an equal opportunity employer. Pay: DOE. Let's Talk.</div>",

You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world and provide skills that will enhance our business intelligence system to help us make better decisions.\\n\\nWe’ll teach you the ins and outs of the online business brokerage industry, coming from years of experience. You’ll work on improving the customer journey, which should be flawless, pain free and easy to navigate. For many of our customers it is the first time either buying or selling an online business, which can be an incredibly anxious and confusing moment in their lives. You’ll be helping them directly by providing them with an easy to use interface that just makes sense.\\nThe Senior Full Stack Engineer position is vital to the success of our company, partnering with all departments to align technology strategy with the company’s objectives.\\n\\nOur small and close knit engineering team currently consists of a UX specialist, 2 frontend engineers, one backend engineer, one WordPress engineer and several QA specialists. You’ll work closely with the team to implement solutions for all departments within Empire Flippers, be it compliance, customer support, sales and migrations. Additional responsibilities could lead to supervising our engineering team.\\n\\nThis is a full time position – our company is growing at a fast rate, which means excellent opportunities for personal and career growth. We may ask you to attend conferences too, which can help you network with industry leaders.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n You’ll take on the challenge of improving the overall efficiency of Empire Flippers by developing fully fledged platforms, ensuring both the user experience and functionality are elevated to unprecedented levels. You’ll be responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment building high quality, architecturally sound systems. You will use your initiative to design and implement client-side and server-side architecture, as well as implement API’s and integrations that address our business needs. Both our clients and staff will be using the software you write and you’ll be responsible for monitoring system performance and configuring new software and hardware. \\n\\n# Requirements\\nYou must have a passion for travel, ideally with long periods of digital nomad experience with travel outside your home country.\\n\\nYou should have at least 5 good years of full stack experience under your belt, having implemented some complex, data driven applications. Your portfolio speaks louder than your words.\\n\\nYou should have team-lead or management experience with a remote team.\\n\\nAn in-depth understanding of database management systems, both relational and non-relational databases.\\n\\nHands on experience in IT, computer systems engineering, or systems engineering and analysis is necessary.\\n\\nYou should have an ability to conduct technological analyses and research, with a solid understanding of technological trends to build strategy.\\n\\nYou should be a ninja with every component of our tech stack. You must have a complete working knowledge of Ruby on Rails, SQL, Postgres, Sidekiq, Rspec, Git, Redis.\\n\\nExperience working with a wide range of 3rd party integrations. Our platform talks to many 3rd party applications, you should have experience building and maintaining such integrations in a test driven fashion.\\n\\nDev-ops/sysadmin skills, particularly AWS. Experience with managing servers, maintaining hosting environments, being responsible for uptime and responsiveness, addressing bottlenecks, ensuring backups are kept safe and sound.\\n\\nYou need to have immaculate attention to detail. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if something doesn’t quite look or feel right, to the nearest code change and to the nearest hexadecimal color, to the point you become annoying to us. At times other developers may edit your code, you’ll be watching to ensure the code base remains readable, scalable and fast.\\n\\nBe a good communicator. It sounds very cliché, but you’ll immerse yourself in almost every department, you’ll be learning problems and presenting solutions, and also overseeing the implementation of those solutions too.\\n\\nA self-starter. We need to see some evidence that you’re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you’ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won’t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day to day basis, you’ll be working in almost full autonomy, we’ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. We don’t believe in micro-management.\\n\\nA complete working knowledge in React. Our client code is written in React. Being able to navigate the front-end code and patch things up is needed.\\n\\nThe following skills/experience would be a bonus, but not required:\\n\\nPHP/WordPress. We will be interfacing with WordPress significantly, being able to speak the same language would be great.\\n\\nDatabases. A comprehensive experience working with various types of SQL and noSQL databases would be very useful. MySQL, Postgres, DynamoDB, Cassandra, to name a few.\\n\\nCaching. The software we’re building needs to be fast and to remain fast as we scale, both in terms of traffic and database size. Having experience with Memcached, Varnish or experience with complicated CDN setups with many rules would be a plus. \\n\\n#Salary\\n$120,000\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

    "content": "<div>Syncro is a small team crafting applications helping small business be more successful. Our software does job tracking, marketing, invoicing, integrates tons of online tools -- and is awesome. We are open to taking risks with technology, we use ember/react/kubernetes in production, and are generally open to exciting fun new stuff! We're building a company that has fun inventing. We go fast, and our customers love us. Thousands of repair shops and IT Professionals all over the world rely on our platform for their entire business operations. We are different - we really do care, the founders are writing this ad and looking at the resumes - not a recruiter or HR department. We are using heroku with 50+ dynos, our platform consists of a number of rails apps and integrations to other platforms. We hook into Google Cloud Print, we're building a huge inventory system to rival any out there, we've built a &quot;remote machine management&quot; platform with an open API, we're doing it all... If this sounds like the kind of team you want to be part of, we want to hear from you. Do you play around with new stuff for fun?Have any cool side projects to test out a new technology?Do you hear about a problem and just obsessed building a web app to solve it?If this sounds like your kind of play - we might be a great fit. :) HIGHLIGHTS: -Salaried position designed to grow with the company (seriously, try us).-We want this to be your dream job - but we need your help (tell us how).-We will advance your career like nobody else -- stay with us for the long haul and we'll keep you challenged, learning, passionate, and growing.-Results-oriented: Keep having fun and shipping code and you can design your day.-We are currently a dispersed team working from home and a few regional offices (Seattle, Bellevue, Bay Area). (WeWork - super cool space ) WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING: -Lots of building and inventing.-Helping discover and flesh out new product ideas. (Roadmap has like 1000 new features we're anxious to get to!)-Keeping us up to date with what you are learning in your spare time.-Bringing in new technology you discover that might solve a problem.-Coming up with improvements to many areas that are still sort of minimum viable state. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR: -A few years of building applications, designing interfaces, etc.-5+ years of Ruby on Rails -No specific education necessary. (really)-Excellent communication skills - verbal, written and electronic.-You care -- which means sometimes putting yourself out there for a customer experiencing pain.-Ability to multi-task in a fast paced environment.-You're kind and wily (in a good way). HOW TO GET HIRED BY US: Write us about a recent time or two that you caused a production outage, what the root cause was, and what you learned from it. For example; Troy our Founder shipped a typo in a class name a bit ago and those are annoying because they might be easily missed in Development environment but then production blows up. This led to a more robust CI+Staging step than we had prior. Just demonstrate that you are an individual, you have a personality, you enjoy life, and you enjoy good work. And please include a resume. :) SyncroMSP is an equal opportunity employer. Pay: DOE. Let's Talk.</div>",

    "content": "<div><br /><h2>The role</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><p>We are looking for a talented senior engineer to join our small-but-growing company at an exciting time for the tech team.</p><br /><p>Started in 2012, CV Partner was initially built by the founder using all the coolest technology for that time: Rails, CoffeeScript and Mongo. A couple of years later a React frontend was added and this stack enabled us to remain agile while we discovered our clients' needs and quickly build the functionality they were seeking. We ended up creating a tool that they enjoy using and has a measurable improvement in their productivity and ability to win bids.</p><br /><p>Now, 7 years on, with a bigger team, many features added, larger clients signed and much more data being processed we're finding the limitations of the current architecture. Some tech debt has accumulated and it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult to keep the ever-expanding Rails app up to date with the latest versions and add new features in a timely manner. Also, we're slightly embarrassed to still be using CoffeeScript in 2019.</p><br /><p>So, we've started to put in place some infrastructure that will help us transition to building microservices. We've begun work on an event-source based architecture with plans to utilise the CQRS pattern. We&rsquo;ve already built some of the main building blocks in Rust and are starting to flesh out how some of the trickier aspects will work (e.g. auth, shared frontend components etc).</p><br /><p>The team is currently comprised of all senior-level people, including two software engineers, a DevOps and a UX designer. The founder also still codes occasionally as we haven't built up the courage to revoke his git access yet.</p><br /><p>You'll help put in place the foundations of the technology and engineering practices that can provide a platform for the company to meet the needs of our clients over the coming years. That means deciding on programming languages, tools and services to help build robust, fast and secure software. We're looking at things such as TypeScript, Vue and GraphQL/AppSync but nothing is set in stone and we value using the best tool for the job.</p><br /><p>The next phase of growth will be to start bringing mid-level or junior engineers into the team, so you should be happy mentoring those with less experience and when the time comes, we'd value your input into the hiring process.</p><br /><p>We're pretty laid-back when it comes to flexible working so you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to spend some time working from home or a co-working space close to home if you have a long commute. As a company, we are distributed across three countries already so most comms are through slack or video call. However, we do value face-to-face communication as not even the best video-conferencing tools can replace a good huddle around a whiteboard. But as said, we're pretty chilled about it, so if you're the right person for us, we'll figure something out.</p><br /></div><br /><h2>Responsibilities</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><ul><br /><li>Develop features for the existing CV Partner application</li><br /><li>Develop the event-sourcing system and platform tools</li><br /><li>Help design and build services on the new platform</li><br /><li>Work closely with DevOps to maintain and enhance the security of CV Partner&rsquo;s systems</li><br /><li>Build internal tools to support business processes</li><br /><li>In the future: Mentor junior or mid-level developers and potentially lead a small team</li><br /></ul><br /></div><br /></div><br /><div><br /><h2>Future challenges</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><ul><br /><li>Break up the current application into smaller services</li><br /><li>Refactor the front-end code, improving the engineering principles around code organisation and testing</li><br /><li>Multi-region production deployments</li><br /><li>Design an effective interview process for junior and mid-level hires</li><br /><li>Automate parsing of CVs and Case Studies - potential for machine learning</li><br /></ul><br /></div><br /></div><br /><div><br /><h2>What we are looking for</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><ul><br /><li>Knowledge in some of the following (Ruby, JavaScript, Clojure, Rust, ElasticSearch, Redis)</li><br /><li>Knowledge of CoffeeScript is not required (we know you won&rsquo;t admit to it anyway)</li><br /><li>Experience in designing microservice architectures</li><br /><li>Enthusiasm to learn new tools and technologies</li><br /><li>Someone with good generalist knowledge: front-end; web development; databases (SQL or otherwise), DevOps; system architecture</li><br /><li>Linux, git, Github knowledge</li><br /><li>Bonus: Event-sourcing/CQRS experience</li><br /><li>Bonus: Front-end expertise</li><br /></ul><br /></div><br /></div><br /><div><br /><h2>Benefits /&nbsp;package</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><p>Location: London, Oslo or Stockholm</p><br /><p>Flexible working / part-remote (with close-to-home co-working)</p><br /><p>Pension contribution</p><br /><p>25 days holiday</p><br /><p>Competitive salary</p><br /><p>Weekly team lunch</p><br /></div><br /></div>",

Gathering around the dinner table, eating with those you care about and enjoying a nutritious meal is paramount to our mission. Therefore, we create software to further empower individuals to bring back family dinner time without sacrificing the little spare time they have available—giving our users time for what matters most.</p><p>OAMM began as a blog in 2009 with a deep, rich, invested community. Over the last six years it has emerged as a SaaS product fueled by the passions and membership of the community. The technology side of our product is exciting and challenging to build but unlike many other SaaS products, it isn’t the technology that drives the product. The driving force is our community/membership. We believe strongly that these two things, technology and community, have to be in balance and we are looking for a software developer that can respect, appreciate and aspire to help us grow both. OAMM is also committed to steady growth through self-funding as we evolve our product.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>Once A Month Meals is looking to add to its technology team an experienced Lead Ruby Software Developer. As part of the OAMM technology team, you’ll work with freezer cooking, “cooking math,” user accounts, ecommerce, and more. You’ll need to be comfortable with databases like MySQL and Postgres, and either understand (or be able to come up to speed quickly on) Solr. Experience designing, building, and supporting REST APIs with authentication is important, because we leverage a number of third party APIs for crucial aspects of our systems.</p><p>It will be important to have the experience and ability to do some long-term, big-picture architecture thinking but have the skills and desire enough to implement this architecture through solid, tested code.&nbsp;</p><p>Your coding abilities are just one piece of the puzzle though. In addition to being able to write great code, this position requires a unique skill set. The following are vital to the success of this position:</p><ol><li><strong>Ruby on Rails Depth of Knowledge</strong> - It isn’t enough to simply have used Ruby here and there, a deep understanding and application of it in your previous work is essential.</li><li><strong>Experience in the Kitchen</strong> - it doesn’t have to be freezer or batch cooking, although experience with those is a plus. Experience in the kitchen cooking, preparing recipes and/or meal planning is important to the role and to understanding the software’s main functions.</li><li><strong>A Love for Math</strong> - fractions, ceilings, scaling recipes and mathematical algorithms are a regular part of coding life in this role. If you told your high school math teacher you would never use algebra again, this probably isn’t the role for you. :)</li><li><strong>Organizational Leadership</strong> - the ability to be self directed, write scopes, document processes and communicate those to a team is imperative. This is a small team (front end developer, project manager and yourself) right now, which means that there is an expectation that you will be able to lead yourself and eventually others. Strong communication and decision making within the context of the greater team mission is important.</li><li><strong>Experience Working on a LIVE Product</strong> - proven experience designing, planning, and building web applications to scale is imperative. There are thousands of active users on this system requiring that the code needs to be incrementally built, tested and released to ensure zero disruptions to the user experience.</li></ol><p><em>Your job duties will include:</em></p><ul><li>Maintaining two Rails apps</li><ul><li>Keeping the Ruby gems updated on staging and production environments</li></ul><li>Watching and improving performance (speed and analytics) of APIs</li><li>Build, maintain and test new features</li><li>Develop automated, incremental, deployments and tests</li><li>Assistance in setting technical direction for the OAMM products</li></ul><p><strong>Skills/Tools/Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Ruby</li><li>Rails</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Postgres</li><li>Git</li><li>Automated deployments (Capistrano, etc.)</li><li>Stripe API</li></ul><p>Because we are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, we all play multiple roles. As we grow, we want to continue to build a product design and development team. This position will be a key-player on that team with opportunity to impact the technical architecture and the future development team.</p><p><strong>The ideal candidate is:</strong></p><ul><li>a self-starter—they seek out opportunities to learn new methods or technologies</li><li>a problem-solver—they figure out how to get things done</li><li>comfortable with task runners like gulp and grunt</li><li>competent with git and github</li><li>mindful of performance and interested in implementing tools like performance budgets</li><li>unashamed in their support of accessibility best practices as well as progressive enhancement and responsive design</li><li>able to communicate effectively in writing and in-person</li><li>willing to balance all constraints of a problem: user needs, timeline, budget, product vision</li><li>A meal planner - they see the benefits and are willing to plan meals for themselves on a regular basis</li><li>collaborative—nothing gets done in a vacuum around here, we need folks who recognize they’ll be better if they work <em>with</em> others</li></ul><p><strong>Experience with deeper software development best-practices (or strong desire to grow into them) is a plus:</strong></p><ul><li>work with other members of the product team to build modular, maintainable and reusable code</li><li>work with internal and external resources to implement fixes and features to the stack currently in place (WordPress, Sass, Rails)</li><li>recommend and implement best-practices around developer productivity, source-control, automated testing, API design, security, performance and share our learnings with the greater tech community</li></ul><p><strong>Additional experience in the following strongly desired:</strong></p><ul><li>Javascript frameworks such as React, Ember, or Angular, or Vue</li><li>Solr</li><li>CircleCI</li><li>Docker</li><li>PHP</li></ul><p><strong>The Culture</strong></p><p>OAMM strives to create an environment where individuals are encouraged to work independently but enabled to work collaboratively. We spend a lot of time on Slack and in video calls interacting daily. We also get together in person at least twice a year for a retreat, usually to a warm climate.  We value spending time with one another when we are at work, and caring for each person, while recognizing and encouraging a work-life family balance.</p><p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive Salary</li><li>Personal Days: Two weeks (plus one week holiday shutdown and minimal standard US holidays due to peak sales periods matching those holidays—so we try to make up for it during the year)</li><li>Flexible Schedule: Work when you want, just provide us with some Eastern Time Zone overlap for meetings</li><li>All the hardware and software needed to do your job</li><li>Opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of families</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/294499?reset=False&amp;ra=1ALtQVkF1YjK&amp;oqs=a%3D1ALtQVkF1YjK%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About Once A Month Meals</h4>            <div><p>We are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, so&nbsp;most of us&nbsp;play multiple roles. The product team includes 3 of our 11 staff members. When fully staffed, we have a full-time front-end developer, a full-time back end developer (that's the position we are hiring now) and a full-time project manager who also serves as a data analyst and QA Tester. Given the small nature of the team you will be both leading and writing code.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology team serves the larger organization in a vital way. The technology powers the membership manager system and the recipe/menu database.&nbsp;The rest of the team is working with the end user directly. We take it very seriously that the technology team is an integrated part of the bigger team. They participate in staff meetings, retreats, conversations about features needed for the end-user and much more.&nbsp;To see more about our culture, values and mission check out -&nbsp;<a href='https://onceamonthmeals.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>https://onceamonthmeals.com/about/</a>.</p><p>Though small now, we want to continue to build a product design and development team as we build the membership base.&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Schedule: Work when you want with some EDT overlap.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Family-Friendly Work Environment w/true work/life balance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical/Dental Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Ample time off including a whole company shut down at the holidays.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>All the hardware and software needed to do your job</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Most of the team works from our office in South Africa. However, a year ago I moved Singapore for work / personal reasons. I used to be quite averse to the idea of remote workers, but seeing as just about everyone will now be remote from my perspective, I decided it's a good time to start focusing on hiring for remote work.</p><p>SimplePay is online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore and Hong Kong. Our software lets thousands of small business owners (and their accountants) run their payrolls without headaches, so they can focus on the challenge of building their businesses. To give you an idea, here's our South African website: <a href='https://www.simplepay.co.za' rel='nofollow'>https://www.simplepay.co.za</a></p><p>Do you believe most SPAs are a pile of steaming crap, but wouldn't mind digging into Vue.js for pages that will benefit from the increased interactivity? Do you laugh when people give up the power of PostgreSQL in favour of data stores that don't offer any benefits for their use case? If so, you may fit in well with our mindset.</p><p>The work will include: Doing direct integrations with other systems (hopefully banks too, eventually). Expanding our API for other systems to integrate with us. Adding new features. Optimising for performance. Integrating with government systems. Squashing bugs. Improving security. Eventually, the opportunity to do some mobile development (probably using Flutter).</p><p>Experience: Due to our full pipeline, we can only hire senior developers who have a few years of Rails experience at this time, or highly experienced polyglots who at least know ruby. Previous experience with remote work would be a bonus - we need people who understand the challenges and can share what they've learnt.</p><p>Location: GMT+4 to GMT+8. (Currently we have developers in South Africa, India, Lebanon and myself Singapore)</p><p>Please mail <a href='mailto:developers+so@simplepay.cloud' rel='nofollow'>developers+so@simplepay.cloud</a> - don't use the built-in submission functionality here. Please include a link to a specific open source contribution or an issue you logged (no matter how tiny or long ago) in the body of your email. I look forward to transforming the company to being more remote-friendly.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/250148?reset=False&amp;ra=1lTiocr98JP2&amp;oqs=a%3D1lTiocr98JP2%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About SimplePay</h4>            <div><p>SimplePay is a developer owned company providing online payroll software for South Africa, Ireland, Singapore.

Gathering around the dinner table, eating with those you care about and enjoying a nutritious meal is paramount to our mission. Therefore, we create software to further empower individuals to bring back family dinner time without sacrificing the little spare time they have available—giving our users time for what matters most.</p><p>OAMM began as a blog in 2009 with a deep, rich, invested community. Over the last six years it has emerged as a SaaS product fueled by the passions and membership of the community. The technology side of our product is exciting and challenging to build but unlike many other SaaS products, it isn’t the technology that drives the product. The driving force is our community/membership. We believe strongly that these two things, technology and community, have to be in balance and we are looking for a software developer that can respect, appreciate and aspire to help us grow both. OAMM is also committed to steady growth through self-funding as we evolve our product.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>Once A Month Meals is looking to add to its technology team an experienced Lead Ruby Software Developer. As part of the OAMM technology team, you’ll work with freezer cooking, “cooking math,” user accounts, ecommerce, and more. You’ll need to be comfortable with databases like MySQL and Postgres, and either understand (or be able to come up to speed quickly on) Solr. Experience designing, building, and supporting REST APIs with authentication is important, because we leverage a number of third party APIs for crucial aspects of our systems.</p><p>It will be important to have the experience and ability to do some long-term, big-picture architecture thinking but have the skills and desire enough to implement this architecture through solid, tested code.&nbsp;</p><p>Your coding abilities are just one piece of the puzzle though. In addition to being able to write great code, this position requires a unique skill set. The following are vital to the success of this position:</p><ol><li><strong>Ruby on Rails Depth of Knowledge</strong> - It isn’t enough to simply have used Ruby here and there, a deep understanding and application of it in your previous work is essential.</li><li><strong>Experience in the Kitchen</strong> - it doesn’t have to be freezer or batch cooking, although experience with those is a plus. Experience in the kitchen cooking, preparing recipes and/or meal planning is important to the role and to understanding the software’s main functions.</li><li><strong>A Love for Math</strong> - fractions, ceilings, scaling recipes and mathematical algorithms are a regular part of coding life in this role. If you told your high school math teacher you would never use algebra again, this probably isn’t the role for you. :)</li><li><strong>Organizational Leadership</strong> - the ability to be self directed, write scopes, document processes and communicate those to a team is imperative. This is a small team (front end developer, project manager and yourself) right now, which means that there is an expectation that you will be able to lead yourself and eventually others. Strong communication and decision making within the context of the greater team mission is important.</li><li><strong>Experience Working on a LIVE Product</strong> - proven experience designing, planning, and building web applications to scale is imperative. There are thousands of active users on this system requiring that the code needs to be incrementally built, tested and released to ensure zero disruptions to the user experience.</li></ol><p><em>Your job duties will include:</em></p><ul><li>Maintaining two Rails apps</li><ul><li>Keeping the Ruby gems updated on staging and production environments</li></ul><li>Watching and improving performance (speed and analytics) of APIs</li><li>Build, maintain and test new features</li><li>Develop automated, incremental, deployments and tests</li><li>Assistance in setting technical direction for the OAMM products</li></ul><p><strong>Skills/Tools/Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Ruby</li><li>Rails</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Postgres</li><li>Git</li><li>Automated deployments (Capistrano, etc.)</li><li>Stripe API</li></ul><p>Because we are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, we all play multiple roles. As we grow, we want to continue to build a product design and development team. This position will be a key-player on that team with opportunity to impact the technical architecture and the future development team.</p><p><strong>The ideal candidate is:</strong></p><ul><li>a self-starter—they seek out opportunities to learn new methods or technologies</li><li>a problem-solver—they figure out how to get things done</li><li>comfortable with task runners like gulp and grunt</li><li>competent with git and github</li><li>mindful of performance and interested in implementing tools like performance budgets</li><li>unashamed in their support of accessibility best practices as well as progressive enhancement and responsive design</li><li>able to communicate effectively in writing and in-person</li><li>willing to balance all constraints of a problem: user needs, timeline, budget, product vision</li><li>A meal planner - they see the benefits and are willing to plan meals for themselves on a regular basis</li><li>collaborative—nothing gets done in a vacuum around here, we need folks who recognize they’ll be better if they work <em>with</em> others</li></ul><p><strong>Experience with deeper software development best-practices (or strong desire to grow into them) is a plus:</strong></p><ul><li>work with other members of the product team to build modular, maintainable and reusable code</li><li>work with internal and external resources to implement fixes and features to the stack currently in place (WordPress, Sass, Rails)</li><li>recommend and implement best-practices around developer productivity, source-control, automated testing, API design, security, performance and share our learnings with the greater tech community</li></ul><p><strong>Additional experience in the following strongly desired:</strong></p><ul><li>Javascript frameworks such as React, Ember, or Angular, or Vue</li><li>Solr</li><li>CircleCI</li><li>Docker</li><li>PHP</li></ul><p><strong>The Culture</strong></p><p>OAMM strives to create an environment where individuals are encouraged to work independently but enabled to work collaboratively. We spend a lot of time on Slack and in video calls interacting daily. We also get together in person at least twice a year for a retreat, usually to a warm climate.  We value spending time with one another when we are at work, and caring for each person, while recognizing and encouraging a work-life family balance.</p><p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive Salary</li><li>Personal Days: Two weeks (plus one week holiday shutdown and minimal standard US holidays due to peak sales periods matching those holidays—so we try to make up for it during the year)</li><li>Flexible Schedule: Work when you want, just provide us with some Eastern Time Zone overlap for meetings</li><li>All the hardware and software needed to do your job</li><li>Opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of families</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/294499?reset=False&amp;ra=1ALtQVkF1YjK&amp;oqs=a%3D1ALtQVkF1YjK' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About Once A Month Meals</h4>            <div><p>We are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, so&nbsp;most of us&nbsp;play multiple roles. The product team includes 3 of our 11 staff members. When fully staffed, we have a full-time front-end developer, a full-time back end developer (that's the position we are hiring now) and a full-time project manager who also serves as a data analyst and QA Tester. Given the small nature of the team you will be both leading and writing code.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology team serves the larger organization in a vital way. The technology powers the membership manager system and the recipe/menu database.&nbsp;The rest of the team is working with the end user directly. We take it very seriously that the technology team is an integrated part of the bigger team. They participate in staff meetings, retreats, conversations about features needed for the end-user and much more.&nbsp;To see more about our culture, values and mission check out -&nbsp;<a href='https://onceamonthmeals.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>https://onceamonthmeals.com/about/</a>.</p><p>Though small now, we want to continue to build a product design and development team as we build the membership base.&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Schedule: Work when you want with some EDT overlap.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Family-Friendly Work Environment w/true work/life balance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical/Dental Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Ample time off including a whole company shut down at the holidays.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>All the hardware and software needed to do your job</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Our software does job tracking, marketing, invoicing, integrates tons of online tools -- and is awesome. We are open to taking risks with technology, we use ember/react/kubernetes in production, and are generally open to exciting fun new stuff! We're building a company that has fun inventing. We go fast, and our customers love us. Thousands of repair shops and IT Professionals all over the world rely on our platform for their entire business operations. We are different - we really do care, the founders are writing this ad and looking at the resumes - not a recruiter or HR department. We are using heroku with 50+ dynos, our platform consists of a number of rails apps and integrations to other platforms. We hook into Google Cloud Print, we're building a huge inventory system to rival any out there, we've built a &quot;remote machine management&quot; platform with an open API, we're doing it all... If this sounds like the kind of team you want to be part of, we want to hear from you. Do you play around with new stuff for fun?Have any cool side projects to test out a new technology?Do you hear about a problem and just obsessed building a web app to solve it?If this sounds like your kind of play - we might be a great fit. :) HIGHLIGHTS: -Salaried position designed to grow with the company (seriously, try us).-We want this to be your dream job - but we need your help (tell us how).-We will advance your career like nobody else -- stay with us for the long haul and we'll keep you challenged, learning, passionate, and growing.-Results-oriented: Keep having fun and shipping code and you can design your day.-We are currently a dispersed team working from home and a few regional offices (Seattle, Bellevue, Bay Area). (WeWork - super cool space ) WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING: -Lots of building and inventing.-Helping discover and flesh out new product ideas. (Roadmap has like 1000 new features we're anxious to get to!)-Keeping us up to date with what you are learning in your spare time.-Bringing in new technology you discover that might solve a problem.-Coming up with improvements to many areas that are still sort of minimum viable state. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR: -A few years of building applications, designing interfaces, etc.-5+ years of Ruby on Rails -No specific education necessary. (really)-Excellent communication skills - verbal, written and electronic.-You care -- which means sometimes putting yourself out there for a customer experiencing pain.-Ability to multi-task in a fast paced environment.-You're kind and wily (in a good way). HOW TO GET HIRED BY US: Write us about a recent time or two that you caused a production outage, what the root cause was, and what you learned from it. For example; Troy our Founder shipped a typo in a class name a bit ago and those are annoying because they might be easily missed in Development environment but then production blows up. This led to a more robust CI+Staging step than we had prior. Just demonstrate that you are an individual, you have a personality, you enjoy life, and you enjoy good work. And please include a resume. :) SyncroMSP is an equal opportunity employer. Pay: DOE. Let's Talk.</div>",

Gathering around the dinner table, eating with those you care about and enjoying a nutritious meal is paramount to our mission. Therefore, we create software to further empower individuals to bring back family dinner time without sacrificing the little spare time they have available—giving our users time for what matters most.</p><p>OAMM began as a blog in 2009 with a deep, rich, invested community. Over the last six years it has emerged as a SaaS product fueled by the passions and membership of the community. The technology side of our product is exciting and challenging to build but unlike many other SaaS products, it isn’t the technology that drives the product. The driving force is our community/membership. We believe strongly that these two things, technology and community, have to be in balance and we are looking for a software developer that can respect, appreciate and aspire to help us grow both. OAMM is also committed to steady growth through self-funding as we evolve our product.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>Once A Month Meals is looking to add to its technology team an experienced Lead Ruby Software Developer. As part of the OAMM technology team, you’ll work with freezer cooking, “cooking math,” user accounts, ecommerce, and more. You’ll need to be comfortable with databases like MySQL and Postgres, and either understand (or be able to come up to speed quickly on) Solr. Experience designing, building, and supporting REST APIs with authentication is important, because we leverage a number of third party APIs for crucial aspects of our systems.</p><p>It will be important to have the experience and ability to do some long-term, big-picture architecture thinking but have the skills and desire enough to implement this architecture through solid, tested code.&nbsp;</p><p>Your coding abilities are just one piece of the puzzle though. In addition to being able to write great code, this position requires a unique skill set. The following are vital to the success of this position:</p><ol><li><strong>Ruby on Rails Depth of Knowledge</strong> - It isn’t enough to simply have used Ruby here and there, a deep understanding and application of it in your previous work is essential.</li><li><strong>Experience in the Kitchen</strong> - it doesn’t have to be freezer or batch cooking, although experience with those is a plus. Experience in the kitchen cooking, preparing recipes and/or meal planning is important to the role and to understanding the software’s main functions.</li><li><strong>A Love for Math</strong> - fractions, ceilings, scaling recipes and mathematical algorithms are a regular part of coding life in this role. If you told your high school math teacher you would never use algebra again, this probably isn’t the role for you. :)</li><li><strong>Organizational Leadership</strong> - the ability to be self directed, write scopes, document processes and communicate those to a team is imperative. This is a small team (front end developer, project manager and yourself) right now, which means that there is an expectation that you will be able to lead yourself and eventually others. Strong communication and decision making within the context of the greater team mission is important.</li><li><strong>Experience Working on a LIVE Product</strong> - proven experience designing, planning, and building web applications to scale is imperative. There are thousands of active users on this system requiring that the code needs to be incrementally built, tested and released to ensure zero disruptions to the user experience.</li></ol><p><em>Your job duties will include:</em></p><ul><li>Maintaining two Rails apps</li><ul><li>Keeping the Ruby gems updated on staging and production environments</li></ul><li>Watching and improving performance (speed and analytics) of APIs</li><li>Build, maintain and test new features</li><li>Develop automated, incremental, deployments and tests</li><li>Assistance in setting technical direction for the OAMM products</li></ul><p><strong>Skills/Tools/Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Ruby</li><li>Rails</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Postgres</li><li>Git</li><li>Automated deployments (Capistrano, etc.)</li><li>Stripe API</li></ul><p>Because we are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, we all play multiple roles. As we grow, we want to continue to build a product design and development team. This position will be a key-player on that team with opportunity to impact the technical architecture and the future development team.</p><p><strong>The ideal candidate is:</strong></p><ul><li>a self-starter—they seek out opportunities to learn new methods or technologies</li><li>a problem-solver—they figure out how to get things done</li><li>comfortable with task runners like gulp and grunt</li><li>competent with git and github</li><li>mindful of performance and interested in implementing tools like performance budgets</li><li>unashamed in their support of accessibility best practices as well as progressive enhancement and responsive design</li><li>able to communicate effectively in writing and in-person</li><li>willing to balance all constraints of a problem: user needs, timeline, budget, product vision</li><li>A meal planner - they see the benefits and are willing to plan meals for themselves on a regular basis</li><li>collaborative—nothing gets done in a vacuum around here, we need folks who recognize they’ll be better if they work <em>with</em> others</li></ul><p><strong>Experience with deeper software development best-practices (or strong desire to grow into them) is a plus:</strong></p><ul><li>work with other members of the product team to build modular, maintainable and reusable code</li><li>work with internal and external resources to implement fixes and features to the stack currently in place (WordPress, Sass, Rails)</li><li>recommend and implement best-practices around developer productivity, source-control, automated testing, API design, security, performance and share our learnings with the greater tech community</li></ul><p><strong>Additional experience in the following strongly desired:</strong></p><ul><li>Javascript frameworks such as React, Ember, or Angular, or Vue</li><li>Solr</li><li>CircleCI</li><li>Docker</li><li>PHP</li></ul><p><strong>The Culture</strong></p><p>OAMM strives to create an environment where individuals are encouraged to work independently but enabled to work collaboratively. We spend a lot of time on Slack and in video calls interacting daily. We also get together in person at least twice a year for a retreat, usually to a warm climate.  We value spending time with one another when we are at work, and caring for each person, while recognizing and encouraging a work-life family balance.</p><p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive Salary</li><li>Personal Days: Two weeks (plus one week holiday shutdown and minimal standard US holidays due to peak sales periods matching those holidays—so we try to make up for it during the year)</li><li>Flexible Schedule: Work when you want, just provide us with some Eastern Time Zone overlap for meetings</li><li>All the hardware and software needed to do your job</li><li>Opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of families</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/294499?reset=False&amp;ra=1ALtQVkF1YjK&amp;oqs=a%3D1ALtQVkF1YjK' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About Once A Month Meals</h4>            <div><p>We are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, so&nbsp;most of us&nbsp;play multiple roles. The product team includes 3 of our 11 staff members. When fully staffed, we have a full-time front-end developer, a full-time back end developer (that's the position we are hiring now) and a full-time project manager who also serves as a data analyst and QA Tester. Given the small nature of the team you will be both leading and writing code.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology team serves the larger organization in a vital way.

The ideal candidate should have mid-level experience, but they won’t be placed in some hierarchical structure.

First and foremost, we value honesty from all employees within our firm. We strongly encourage a work environment centered on open communication and conscientiousness. Working remotely gives our employees the ability to better maintain a work-life balance, but we expect that productivity and job performance will not be sacrificed.\\n\\nWe are a fully remote team so you will need to be flexible to work with staff in different time zones when necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n\\n\\n* Improve and maintain deployment environment and tools\\n\\n* Design and build efficient, reusable, and reliable Ruby code\\n\\n* Integration of data storage solutions Postgresql and Redis\\n\\n* Expand and improve test coverage\\n\\n* Identify bottlenecks and bugs then devise solutions to these problems\\n\\n* Help maintain code quality, organization, and automation\\n\\n* Integrations with external APIs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkills\\n\\n\\n* Experience setting up and maintaining deployment environments using Linux and Nginx\\n\\n* Knowledge of best practices and IT operations in an always-up, always-available service\\n\\n* Experience with automation/configuration management using either Puppet, Chef, or an equivalent\\n\\n* Ability to use a wide variety of open source technologies and cloud services\\n\\n* Strong experience with SQL and PostgreSQL\\n\\n* Advanced understanding of object-oriented programming\\n\\n* Experience with Ruby on Rails, along with common libraries such as Sidekiq\\n\\n* Intermediate understanding of the syntax of Ruby and its nuances\\n\\n* Intermediate understanding of Javascript and Jquery\\n\\n* Familiarity with front end frameworks such as Vue, React or Angular\\n\\n* Familiarity with concepts of MVC, ORM, and RESTful design patterns\\n\\n* A knack for writing clean, readable Ruby code\\n\\n* Ability to integrate multiple data sources and databases into one system\\n\\n* Understanding of fundamental design principles behind a scalable application\\n\\n* Able to create database schemas that represent and support business processes\\n\\n* Able to implement automated testing platforms and unit tests\\n\\n* Proficient understanding of code versioning tools such as Git\\n\\n* Familiarity with development aiding tools such as Bower, Bundler, Rake, etc.\\n\\n* Familiarity with continuous integration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompensation: Salary commensurate with knowledge, experience, and qualifications.\\n\\nPolitech is an Equal Opportunity Employer that greatly values diversity at our company.

Introduce yourself to us as a colleague. Show us your future here! We value great writers, so be yourself, be creative. Stock cover letters won’t do. Tell us why you want this job. Let us know why you want to work at Politech and not somewhere else.\\n\\nYou should be able to show samples of your previous work upon request.  </div> </div>",

Each of our apps has a dedicated team of designers and developers who are committed to refining and expanding their specific app in response to real customer needs. Our customers include over 90 of the 100 largest churches in the country, but also tens of thousands of small community and neighborhood churches, and we strive to make day-to-day operations easier for all of them.</p><p>We’re a development driven company — over half our staff are either developers or designers who code, and even our founder spends much of his time programming — and we’re seeking another developer with expertise in Ruby, Rails, and React to help make our software even better.</p><p><strong>Developers at Planning Center are:</strong></p><ul><li>Invested. We care about the products we create and the people we create them for, and we all contribute to the vision and direction of our apps. Every one of our developers is critical to their team.</li><li>Curious. We aren’t afraid to ask questions, experiment, and iterate. We also love playing with fun new technologies, and we have Free Weeks every few months for exploring projects that spark our interest.</li></ul><ul><li>Humble. We are always looking for opportunities to grow and learn from one another.</li></ul><p>We believe the strongest teams are made up of people with diverse backgrounds and experiences, and we are committed to cultivating that diversity here at Planning Center. We are ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do your best work.</p><p><strong>In your daily life at Planning Center, you could expect to:</strong></p><ul><li>Take ownership of your projects and have a voice in how to best complete them</li><li>Collaborate with your product manager, front-end designer, and fellow app team developers</li><li>Engage in an agile development process</li><li>Make coffee eight different ways in our rad coffee bar</li><li>…or, if you’re remote, drink coffee in a hip co-working space that we help pay for</li><li>Do work you’re proud of alongside a team of smart, thoughtful, like-minded developers</li></ul><p><strong>What to Expect If You Apply</strong></p><p>There’s no reason for this process to be an adventure full of unknown surprises! Here’s what you’re getting yourself into:</p><ol><li>Submit your resume.</li><li>We’ll have a quick and casual phone call (10-15 minutes) to introduce ourselves and to double check that this position is the type of position that you are interested in and could be a good fit for.</li><li>You’ll be sent a programming exercise covering the basics of the tech stack that we use at Planning Center (Ruby, Rails, and React). This is an opportunity for you to see a glimpse of the kind of work you’d be doing here, and for us to begin evaluating technical skills.</li><li>A live pair programming exercise with our team. There’s no whiteboards, and no typing! Someone from our team will type as the two of you work through a pair programming exercise together. You’ll get to meet another potential future co-worker, and we’ll get a glimpse into how you work as we make some tests pass together.</li><li>Pack your bags, you’re coming to San Diego! The final step is a day in our San Diego office where you’ll get to meet our leadership team and members of your potential new product team. It will be a full day of interviews with different people where we’ll both have lots of chances to find out if we’re a good fit for each other.</li><li>It’s offer time! Throughout all the previous steps, your expertise and experience have been assessed against our well defined developer levels and the salary amount of the offer will be decided solely based on that assessment. At Planning Center, every developer of the same skill level makes the same amount (plus a small bonus for seniority). We aim to pay at the 90th percentile for each level based on research from Payscale.</li></ol><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ol><li>Eligible to work in the United States.</li><li><strong>If remote, must be willing to travel to the office four times each year to connect with the rest of the team in person.</strong></li><li>Proven experience as a full stack developer (or similar role) using Ruby, Rails, and React.</li></ol><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p>We love our people and want this to be the best place for them to work. In addition to&nbsp;<strong>a competitive salary (starting between $100,000 – $150,000 depending on expertise),</strong>&nbsp;we offer:</p><ul><li>Full health, dental, and vision coverage</li><li>Company contribution to a 401(k)</li><li>Mobile phone allowance</li><li>Co-working stipend</li><li>Health stipend for counseling or a gym membership</li><li>Charitable giving match</li><li>Paid parental leave</li><li>Vacation and paid holidays</li><li>Paid Fridays off in the summer</li><li>Continual education allowance for books, videos, or conferences</li><li>Free weeks every several months to work on a project of your choosing</li></ul><p><strong>Gear</strong></p><p>The things you need to get your job done – laptop, monitor, standing desk, chair – all on us!</p><p><strong>Work from Anywhere in the USA</strong></p><p><strong>We are dedicated to hiring the best talent available; part of working at Planning Center is the option to work remote! We fly our remote team into the office once every quarter, so you can enjoy the nice California weather and connect with the rest of the team (75% of which is remote).</strong></p><p>If you’ve applied in the past, feel free to apply again!</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://pco.workable.com/j/F788093D08?viewed=true' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Each of our apps has a dedicated team of designers and developers who are committed to refining and expanding their specific app in response to real customer needs. Our customers include over 90 of the 100 largest churches in the country, but also tens of thousands of small community and neighborhood churches, and we strive to make day-to-day operations easier for all of them.\\n\\nWe’re a development driven company — over half our staff are either developers or designers who code, and even our founder spends much of his time programming — and we’re seeking another developer with expertise in Ruby, Rails, and React to help make our software even better.\\n\\n\\n### Developers at Planning Center are:\\n\\n**Invested.**&nbsp;We care about the products we create and the people we create them for, and we all contribute to the vision and direction of our apps. Every one of our developers is critical to their team. \\n\\n**Curious.**&nbsp;We aren’t afraid to ask questions, experiment, and iterate. We also love playing with fun new technologies, and we have Free Weeks every few months for exploring projects that spark our interest. \\n\\n**Humble.**&nbsp;We are always looking for opportunities to grow and learn from one another.\\n\\nWe believe the strongest teams are made up of people with diverse backgrounds and experiences, and we are committed to cultivating that diversity here at Planning Center. We are ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do your best work.\\n\\n### In your daily life at Planning Center, you could expect to:\\n\\n* Take ownership of your projects and have a voice in how to best complete them\\n* Collaborate with your product manager, front-end designer, and fellow app team developers\\n* Engage in an agile development process\\n* Make coffee eight different ways in our rad coffee bar\\n* ...or, if you’re remote, drink coffee in a hip co-working space that we help pay for\\n* Do work you’re proud of alongside a team of smart, thoughtful, like-minded developers\\n\\n### What to Expect If You Apply\\n\\nThere's no reason for this process to be an adventure full of unknown surprises! Here's what you're getting yourself into:\\n\\n1. Submit your resume.\\n2. We'll have a quick and casual phone call (10-15 minutes) to introduce ourselves and to double check that this position is the type of position that you are interested in and could be a good fit for.\\n3. You'll be sent a programming exercise covering the basics of the tech stack that we use at Planning Center (Ruby, Rails, and React). This is an opportunity for you to see a glimpse of the kind of work you'd be doing here, and for us to begin evaluating technical skills.\\n4. A live pair programming exercise with our team. There's no whiteboards, and no typing! Someone from our team will type as the two of you work through a pair programming exercise together. You'll get to meet another potential future co-worker, and we'll get a glimpse into how you work as we make some tests pass together.\\n5. Pack your bags, you're coming to San Diego! The final step is a day in our San Diego office where you'll get to meet our leadership team and members of your potential new product team. It will be a full day of interviews with different people where we'll both have lots of chances to find out if we're a good fit for each other.\\n6. It's offer time! Throughout all the previous steps, your expertise and experience have been assessed against our [well defined developer levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHCkuuwvTvFhr9N0eAQg9O4OUVAcCaejYqDe8eEnQyY) and the salary amount of the offer will be decided solely based on that assessment. At Planning Center, every developer of the same skill level makes the same amount (plus a small bonus for seniority). We aim to pay at the 90th percentile for each level based on research from [Payscale](https://payscale.com).\\n\\n\\n### Requirements\\n\\n1. Eligible to work in the United States.\\n2. If remote, must be willing to travel to the office four times each year to connect with the rest of the team in person.\\n3. Proven experience as a full stack developer (or similar role) using Ruby, Rails, and React.\\n\\n\\n### Benefits\\n\\nWe love our people and want this to be the best place for them to work. In addition to a competitive salary (starting between&nbsp;**$100,000 - $150,000**&nbsp;depending on expertise), we offer:\\n\\n* Full health, dental, and vision coverage\\n* Company contribution to a 401(k)\\n* Mobile phone allowance\\n* Co-working stipend\\n* Health stipend for counseling or a gym membership\\n* Charitable giving match\\n* Paid parental leave\\n* Vacation and paid holidays\\n* Paid Fridays off in the summer\\n* Continual education allowance for books, videos, or conferences\\n* Free weeks every several months to work on a project of your choosing\\n\\n### Gear\\n\\nThe things you need to get your job done - laptop, monitor, standing desk, chair - all on us!\\n\\n### Work from Anywhere in the USA\\n\\nWe are dedicated to hiring the best talent available; part of working at Planning Center is the option to work remote! We fly our remote team into the office once every quarter, so you can enjoy the nice California weather and connect with the rest of the team (75% of which is remote).\\n\\nIf you've applied in the past, feel free to apply again!  </div> </div>",

    "content": "At Planning Center, we build powerful, beautiful applications specifically for churches. Each of our apps has a dedicated team of designers and developers who are committed to refining and expanding their specific app in response to real customer needs. Our customers include over 90 of the 100 largest churches in the country, but also tens of thousands of small community and neighborhood churches, and we strive to make day-to-day operations easier for all of them.We’re a development driven company — over half our staff are either developers or designers who code, and even our founder spends much of his time programming — and we’re seeking another developer with expertise in Ruby, Rails, and React to help make our software even better.### Developers at Planning Center are:**Invested.** We care about the products we create and the people we create them for, and we all contribute to the vision and direction of our apps. Every one of our developers is critical to their team.  **Curious.** We aren’t afraid to ask questions, experiment, and iterate. We also love playing with fun new technologies, and we have Free Weeks every few months for exploring projects that spark our interest.  **Humble.** We are always looking for opportunities to grow and learn from one another.We believe the strongest teams are made up of people with diverse backgrounds and experiences, and we are committed to cultivating that diversity here at Planning Center. We are ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do your best work.### In your daily life at Planning Center, you could expect to:* Take ownership of your projects and have a voice in how to best complete them* Collaborate with your product manager, front-end designer, and fellow app team developers* Engage in an agile development process* Make coffee eight different ways in our rad coffee bar* ...or, if you’re remote, drink coffee in a hip co-working space that we help pay for* Do work you’re proud of alongside a team of smart, thoughtful, like-minded developers### What to Expect If You ApplyThere's no reason for this process to be an adventure full of unknown surprises! Here's what you're getting yourself into:1. Submit your resume.2. We'll have a quick and casual phone call (10-15 minutes) to introduce ourselves and to double check that this position is the type of position that you are interested in and could be a good fit for.3. You'll be sent a programming exercise covering the basics of the tech stack that we use at Planning Center (Ruby, Rails, and React). This is an opportunity for you to see a glimpse of the kind of work you'd be doing here, and for us to begin evaluating technical skills.4. A live pair programming exercise with our team. There's no whiteboards, and no typing! Someone from our team will type as the two of you work through a pair programming exercise together. You'll get to meet another potential future co-worker, and we'll get a glimpse into how you work as we make some tests pass together.5. Pack your bags, you're coming to San Diego! The final step is a day in our San Diego office where you'll get to meet our leadership team and members of your potential new product team. It will be a full day of interviews with different people where we'll both have lots of chances to find out if we're a good fit for each other.6. It's offer time! Throughout all the previous steps, your expertise and experience have been assessed against our [well defined developer levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KHCkuuwvTvFhr9N0eAQg9O4OUVAcCaejYqDe8eEnQyY) and the salary amount of the offer will be decided solely based on that assessment. At Planning Center, every developer of the same skill level makes the same amount (plus a small bonus for seniority). We aim to pay at the 90th percentile for each level based on research from [Payscale](https://payscale.com).### Requirements1. Eligible to work in the United States.2. If remote, must be willing to travel to the office four times each year to connect with the rest of the team in person.3. Proven experience as a full stack developer (or similar role) using Ruby, Rails, and React.### BenefitsWe love our people and want this to be the best place for them to work. In addition to a competitive salary (starting between **$100,000 - $150,000** depending on expertise), we offer:* Full health, dental, and vision coverage* Company contribution to a 401(k)* Mobile phone allowance* Co-working stipend* Health stipend for counseling or a gym membership* Charitable giving match* Paid parental leave* Vacation and paid holidays* Paid Fridays off in the summer* Continual education allowance for books, videos, or conferences* Free weeks every several months to work on a project of your choosing### GearThe things you need to get your job done - laptop, monitor, standing desk, chair - all on us!### Work from Anywhere in the USAWe are dedicated to hiring the best talent available; part of working at Planning Center is the option to work remote! We fly our remote team into the office once every quarter, so you can enjoy the nice California weather and connect with the rest of the team (75% of which is remote).If you've applied in the past, feel free to apply again!",

You will coach them toward their growth goals or learn amazing things from them depending on the day and the technology you’re working with, work with them and the rest of the Bellroy team to understand (and contribute to) the businesses needs and, in our agile environment, help the team ship all of the things!</p><p>You will have plenty of time to write code, but (in this role) we’re looking for someone who gets at least as excited about growing and developing their people, their team’s practices &amp; processes, and in making sure that the things your team ships are&nbsp;<em>actually useful</em>&nbsp;(rather than technically what the story description said) as we are in someone who can write excellent code on their own. We also have technical leads who focus on technical reviews, code quality and our enterprise architecture strategy – and you’re welcome to jump in on those things too. We need enough technical leaders to build an innovative yet stable platform. And enough people leaders to help the team learn and grow. We make a clear distinction between these two streams because if you’re a great developer, managing people should not be your only path to career progression.</p><p>The majority of our current codebases are in pure Ruby or Ruby on Rails, so you must have at least a working understanding of those technologies. We use React and Elm in the front-end, and we’re starting to move more toward the latter. We’re working toward a headless e-commerce model and re-assessing our technical stack. You will have opportunities to learn and master new programming languages and frameworks (we’re leaning towards Haskell, and have deployed our first production system in it).</p><p>A quick note: We’re currently advertising a number of roles, so if this one doesn’t quite tick all of your boxes, check out our Senior Technical Lead position, and if the job you really wish we were advertising is some combination of these advertised roles, apply anyway. As part of your application tell us what you’re really looking for.</p><p><strong>YOU COULD BE THE ONE, IF YOU…</strong></p><ul><li>Have a solid technical background in a web application stack like Ruby on Rails</li><li>Get excited about great books and the ideas you can steal from them – technical and non-technical books alike</li><li>Understand and can argue the pros and cons of different software methodologies</li><li>Have experience leading and enjoy empowering other developers</li><li>Think a workplace with dogs, coffee, breakout spaces and casual dresscode sounds like a great place to be</li><li>Want to work for a company that cares about doing good things for the world</li></ul><p><strong>YOU PROBABLY AREN’T THE ONE, IF YOU…</strong></p><ul><li>Prefer working on your own, and staying away from face-to-face conversations (in that case consider applying for this Tech Lead role)</li><li>Care more about tabs vs spaces than Scrum vs Kanban</li><li>Are looking for a key role in technology selection and architecture (Tech Lead role)</li><li>Work just to pay the bills, no matter who is paying you or what you’re working on</li></ul><p><strong>WHY WORK FOR BELLROY?</strong></p><p>We have carefully built our culture on radical effectiveness. Our credo is “smart people with good intentions who get shit done” (yes, really). We have an awesome workplace in the heart of Fitzroy with free snacks and coffee (and a smaller workspace in Bells Beach).</p><p>Bellroy’s mission is to inspire better ways to carry; use business as a force for good; and help the world – and our crew – flourish. We make great carry products that delight people in their everyday lives. We help our staff love their work and grow as people. We donate a portion of our revenue to some of the world’s most effective charities. We are constantly looking for better ways to do… well, everything.

In order to build a cohesive and efficient product experience across the whole journey, we recently created a Growth team, as a sub-team of the larger Marketplace organization, to optimize the whole funnel from registration to lease.

There are so many interesting problems to solve around building and maintaining trust, creating efficiencies for different kinds of small, local businesses, creating transparency in the market – the list goes on and on.</span><br> </li><li> <span>Collaborating with our designers to understand our users and guide product decisions. Ultimately, every one of our users will interact with code you’ve written, so we hope you care deeply about their experience.</span><br> </li><li> <span>Improving our codebase.

We strive to be good at both giving and receiving code review.</span><br> </li><li><span>Helping to keep big projects on track without a lot of day-to-day intervention from managers. We’re looking for engineers who take a holistic view of what they’re working on and are more than just ticket-takers.</span></li><li> <span>We're currently piloting a workflow modeled on Basecamp's <i>Shape Up</i>&nbsp;book, and while we may not follow it to the letter once the pilot is over, we're looking for folks who would be excited to work in a system like that.</span><br> </li></ul><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span><b>Requirements</b></span></div><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><ul><li> <span>You’re an experienced developer who is comfortable working across the full stack of a modern, well-tested Ruby on Rails application.
