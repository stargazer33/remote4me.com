We want to democratize capital by making money more accessible for those who need to borrow it and by making investments with strong returns available to those who would like a better financial future.</p><p>We want to help people grow a nest egg even if they think they can’t… and to do it while supporting Main Street, not Wall Street!</p><p>Our first product is a free micro-investment app that helps you save &amp; grow your money – a dollar at a time. It monitors your everyday spending and rounds up each transaction to a whole dollar. It then automatically invests every $10 into a 5% interest earning Worthy Bond, which in turn supports small creditworthy businesses across the U.S., helping to strengthen our local communities.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with offices in sunny Boca Raton, Florida. We avoid the noise of Slack, but we use Twist, Keybase and Confluence to keep in sync. We're on Gitlab to take advantage of their integrated CI/CD pipeline (we love continuous stuff!) and issue tracker.</p><h5>Who you are</h5><p>You’re an experienced backend web developer who has worked for 5+ years on a few production web apps and APIs at scale. Experience working on financial or accounting applications preferred.</p><p>You use Python on a daily basis for various tasks, from APIs to scheduled tasks and maintenance scripts.</p><p>You can design and implement an API and future-proof it. You have a strong opinion on whether APIs should be versioned in the URI or in a response header, and can defend that opinion. You know how to upgrade an API while keeping it backwards-compatible for older clients.</p><p>You’re aware of which data fits best in a relational database and which in a document-oriented one. You can use a framework-provided ORM, but can also jump in and fine-tune SQL queries when needed. You know enough database management to create and maintain an efficient schema in PostgreSQL, indexes and all.</p><p>You’re experienced enough to avoid most bugs and programming errors, but you use tools such as linters and write unit &amp; integration tests to catch all the others.</p><p>You can secure both internal and public-facing APIs using different methods, including one-time passwords (TOTP) for two-factor authentication. You consider security and privacy when designing any new features or reviewing existing code.</p><p>Most importantly, you can communicate clearly and efficiently in writing, as well as in online video/audio calls. You can handle the async (over)communication requirements of a remote-first environment and can manage your own time and productivity.</p><p>For everyone’s sake, you develop on either OS X or a Linux flavor. We don’t do windows.</p><p>You are eligible to legally work in the U.S. as a full-time employee. Given the role's responsibilities, this is a hard requirement, even though we will have other positions where we can hire more liberally. Note that this doesn't require actual presence in the U.S. (expats welcome!).</p><h5>What you’ll do</h5><p>We’ve build a solid, stable serverless API using Zappa on AWS Lambda. Our infrastructure is mostly managed via Terraform and our deployments are one-click, thanks to Gitlab’s CI/CD pipelines. While we rely on third parties for some key features, we’ve never had any downtime caused by anything we wrote.</p><p>Concretely, you’ll help build new business features as we grow our offerings. You will help us trim our backlog and keep technical debt in check. Since we already have robust test coverage, you will help maintain that by writing unit and integration tests for all new features and any bugs fixed.</p><p>You will also perform light devOps duties via Terraform and (rarely) manually, such as Gitlab instance upgrades or bastion security checks and updates. You’ll participate in planning &amp; prioritization meetings to help estimate complexity and think of creative solutions to business and growth problems.</p><p>You are required to have at least basic experience with our existing stack, but more importantly, you need to have the ability and desire to learn and adapt.</p><h5>What you’ll get</h5><p>You can work remote from anywhere or from our office in Boca Raton, FL</p><ul><li>you’ll set your own work schedule, as long as you can deliver and be productive (we prefer two 3-hour focused, uninterrupted work sessions, with morning, lunch and evening communication breaks to stay in sync)</li><li>competitive salary for a remote position</li><li>health insurance &amp; stock options</li><li>more benefits as we continue growing</li></ul><p></p>                      <h4>Desired Skills</h4>            <ul>                              <li><span>Amazon Web Services</span></li>                              <li><span>Celery</span></li>                              <li><span>Flask</span></li>                              <li><span>PostgreSQL</span></li>                              <li><span>Terraform</span></li>                          </ul>                                <h4>How to Apply</h4>            <p></p><p>We don’t do resumes. They only prove who signed your previous paychecks.</p><p>Send us your Git(hub/lab/bucket) profile, places where we can &quot;see&quot; your backend code in production, along with a short email explaining what kinds of problems you solved in the past, and how you did it.</p><p>In essence, please convince us we’re a good fit for each other with any arguments you’d like.</p><p>We’ll contact you by phone or email for a quick chat, then we’ll set up a video call with the CEO and CTO.</p><p>There will be no gimmicky interview quizzes or whiteboard tests. Instead, we’ll ask you to show us some code, either from a previous job or, if NDAs prevent that, we’ll write some together. This is not to test you under pressure, but to filter out the inevitable applicants who are trying to fake it till they make it.</p><p>We’ll ask you to try out something new and talk us through it, whether it’s a new framework, concept (GraphQL instead of REST?) or an AWS service neither of us used before. We do this to see if you’re willing and able to learn new things and how you handle bumping into small obstacles on the way to delivering something that works, however trivial.</p><p></p>                                <h4>Contact Info</h4>            <ul>                                          <li><strong>Company Website:</strong> <a href='https://worthybonds.com' rel='nofollow'>https://worthybonds.com</a></li>            </ul>                  </div><a href='https://worthy-financial.breezy.hr/p/41fc2b92488301-senior-python-backend-developer' rel='nofollow'>Apply</a>",

We pride ourselves on understanding the lower levels of a networked application while at the same time realizing how incredibly important UX is. In 2009 we took the step and launched loadimpact.com, becoming a product company rather than a consulting company, and we have never looked back.</p><p>Recruiting is ongoing.

Each team member is respected equally and acts as a valuable contributor.<br><br></div><div><br>How to Apply<br><br></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Please state in the subject the job position you are applying for</li><li>Please mention your city and country of residence in your application</li><li>English applications only - a professional speaking and writing command of English is required for this role</li><li>Due to time zone difficulties, we’re currently only accepting applicants in European timezones</li></ul><div><br></div><div>For more information about us and to see our work, please check out <a href='https://www.cvedia.com/' rel='nofollow'>cvedia.com<br></a><br></div></div>",

We match the content from different sources to cross-check the information and obtain a more complete picture of each place we've found.</p><p>We organise it all into a coherent hierarchy and rank everything from a traveller's perspective, including taking into account different personas. Along the way we apply smart algorithms and data mining techniques to analyse the data and extract even more information about places.</p><p>Finally, it goes into a database that powers our API and apps.</p><p>Sound like your cup of tea? Come join us! You'll get to shape the future direction of the pipeline and the travel API, working on adding new features and more smart analysis.</p><p>Our pipeline is implemented in python, using a mapreduce framework. The API is implemented using Django, deployed to AWS using Docker containers and serving data out of a postgres database.</p><p><strong>The role</strong></p><p>This is not an ordinary development job. Candidates must be comfortable designing, implementing and maintaining complex algorithms.&nbsp;We're looking for smart, talented developers who are willing to learn whatever it takes to get the job done. These things are more important to us than experience with any particular technologies, so if that's you, then don't worry if you don't tick all the other boxes.</p><p>Because we are a distributed international team, there is the possibility to work either remotely or&nbsp;in our office in Milan. When working remotely, an EMEA timezone is strongly preferred and you will be expected to travel occasionally to meet up face-to-face.</p><p><strong>What you will do</strong></p><ul><li>You won’t just be writing code all day, you’ll play an active part in shaping our product</li><li>You'll spend time on innovation on a regular basis</li><li>You'll be part of an excellent independent team&nbsp;working in a dynamic environment</li></ul><p><strong>Desired experience</strong></p><ul><li>experience with Linux or similar environment recommended</li><li>experience with Python recommended</li><li>experience with mapreduce and similar techniques for data processing an advantage</li><li>experience with machine learning an advantage</li><li>experience with natural language processing an advantage</li><li>experience with Django, AWS and/or Docker a bonus</li></ul><p><strong>About you</strong></p><ul><li>good communication skills</li><li>written and spoken English (level B2 or higher)</li><li>affinity with travel a plus</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Every Friday is a Tech Friday, where you can study and/or test new technologies</li><li>Tickets for tech conferences</li><li>Freedom to choose your dev tools (hardware and software)</li></ul><p>If working&nbsp;in the Milan office:</p><ul><li>Free fruit</li><li>Free Espresso and breakfast</li><li>Free beer (only on Friday)</li><li>Meal tickets</li></ul>Musement is a certified Great Place To Work® and among the Top 20 Best Workplaces in Italy&nbsp;<a href='http://www.greatplacetowork.it/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.greatplacetowork.it/</a>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://musement.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk03xs2?pjb_hash=mnCvd505&amp;apply_now=true' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Musement</h4>            <div><p><strong>MUSEMENT&nbsp;</strong>helps travelers enjoy in-destination experiences to the fullest, sourcing local knowledge and recommendations to make the best use of time. Whether it’s activities, tours, tickets or just ideas for a great night out, we make all bookings easy and secure with&nbsp;<strong><a href='http://musement.com/' rel='nofollow'>Musement.com</a></strong>&nbsp;and our app (iOS and Android). This is the new travel: bookings on the go, the best selections, immediate skip-the-line access to venues and events, bespoke experiences and local knowledge – the right tools delivering useful information in the simplest way. We launched in Milan in 2013 and have since taken root in 70 different countries. Right now, our offer extends to 450 cities, thousands of potential things to do and see, and availability in eight languages – making us a leading guide for international travel activities. Our traveler-friendly technology has been featured in such international publications as Wired, TechCrunch, Daily Telegraph, Bloomberg, Corriere della Sera and Times of India. We’ve been selected by Apple as ‘Best of 2014’ in European App Stores and again in 2016 as one of its ‘Best Apps to Start 2016.’ In October 2017 we acquired the travel content platform Triposo, bringing together more than 12 million travelers across both platforms and offering them hyper-personalized travel content and booking options. In December 2017 we were awarded with the Great Place To Work Italia Certification. We were successfully ranked in the Top 20 Best Workplaces in Italy (Medium size companies category).</p>            </div>        ",

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. Diversity drives our vibe. We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>About The Role</strong></strong></p><p>You will be responsible for technical design and work in the Billing area of Elastic’s Cloud product. This area is responsible for services that power Elastic’s SaaS subscription billing platform. This role is very impactful to Elastic -- you will collaborate with partners from Finance, Sales Operations, and IT teams to provide end-to-end billing and invoicing capabilities for our users. You will lead by example and should participate in coding, debugging complex failure scenarios, and triaging bugs. You’ll analyze the current system, participate in roadmap and project planning efforts, and will have ownership for delivering it. You’ll be participating in project management efforts as the teams execute on plans, and you’ll have a role in communicating progress and status to partners.</p><p><strong><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed components and APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is very transparent in our organization. We feel that anyone needs to be in a position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong><strong>Some of the things you'll work on</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Provide technical leadership for the Billing area of Cloud. This includes working on the parts of codebase that brings in monthly subscription revenue from thousands of Elasticsearch Service users.</li><li>Lead the team to help build scalable solutions to deliver the best payments experience for the Elasticsearch Service.</li><li>Own, curate, and execute your area's product roadmap, partnering with product managers, engineering managers, and other peers across Cloud and Elastic teams.</li><li>Understand our company strategy and help to translate it into technical deliverables and guide Cloud’s product direction to realize it.</li><li>Create technical designs and build POCs for new efforts, validating a wild idea works before committing to it.</li><li>Be a contact point in Cloud for other teams within Elastic. Examples include helping Support with difficult cases or consulting with the Sales Operations and IT teams to improve our end to end billing and reporting flow.</li><li>Be hands-on with the codebase. Review work done by the team, and provide constructive feedback.</li><li>Help the team define coding practices and standards.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>What you will bring along&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Proven experience as a software engineer, with a track record of delivering high-quality code.</li><li>Experience with Python as a programming language.</li><li>Comfortable working and communicating with teams from several functions – finance, data analytics, IT, etc.</li><li>Previous experience working with a SaaS platform or product.</li><li>Previous experience providing technical leadership for a team of software engineers.</li><li>Previous experience in an ownership role for roadmap curation and execution.</li><li>Experience gathering or analyzing usage data from hosting providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) is a huge plus.</li><li>Experience working on a SaaS subscription billing platform such as Stripe, Zoura, Recurly is a huge plus.</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><ul><li>Deeply competitive pay and benefits</li><li>Equity compensation</li><li>Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices</li><li>An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life</li><li>Passionate people building phenomenal products</li></ul><p>Elastic is an Equal Employment employer committed to the principles of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action for all applicants and employees.

It is one of our two main products. Over the last year, we’ve been experiencing strong growth and we are now looking for an excellent generalist to join our team.\\nYou will be the technical lead for Draftable API and oversee much of web infrastructure. You will be working with our Product Lead and other team members to prioritize and build features. \\nYou will also be involved with developing our document comparison viewer, which is written in Javascript and used in all our products.\\nYou will spend at least 80% of your time thinking about how to implement things and writing code.\\n\\n# About you\\n* You have 5+ years of experience with Python (Django, Django REST Framework).\\n* You have 3+ years of experience with front-end development (Javascript, CSS, HTML).\\n* You have at least a year of experience with React.\\n* You are independent and self-reliant. You are happy working on a task by yourself but you will take initiative to involve other team members when necessary.\\n* You have a strong awareness of efficiency and computer science fundamentals (but you don’t need to know this stuff cold like a grad).\\n* You appreciate the importance of clear communication, especially in a remote role.\\n\\n# Work/life balance\\nWe understand you have a life outside work and we will respect your non-working and family time. We expect engineers to work a full-time load of 40 hours per week (and no more) and to be very productive during that time.\\nOur team is mostly remote (5 in Melbourne, 2 in Poland, and a few travelling the world). And we prefer working with remote engineers, but we’re also open to welcoming you into our Melbourne office. \\nYou will have flexibility to schedule your work around your other obligations but you will usually work at a fixed time. If your work hours don’t have much overlap with Australian business hours, you will need to be flexible with scheduling meetings late at night or early in the morning.\\nOur service is very stable and we haven’t had any critical incidents that required urgent attention over the last year.\\n\\n# About our culture\\nWe’re easy-going and easy to work with. We’re developer-led and have a flat structure. We are collaborative, and we expect you to take an active role in evolving our engineering culture. We like writing things down. We love Slack.\\nWe launch things as soon as they’re ready. We do things right the first time, even if it takes a little longer. We don’t have much technical debt. From time to time we promise a feature to customer, but we otherwise don’t have many external deadlines.\\n\\n# Some things you might be doing in your first few months\\n* Adding a new end-point to Draftable API\\n* Build an admin interface for internal staff\\n* Get our integration tests running inside docker\\n* Build a marketing sign-up page for our website that pipes form data through to Salesforce\\n* Work with our product lead to add a feature to our comparison viewer\\n\\n\\n# About our technical stack\\nWe have a fairly standard tech stack: Python (Django, Celery, SaltStack), React, PostgreSQL, Redis and RabbitMQ. Our frontend is JS, react, CSS, HTML.\\nOur core algorithms and products are written in .NET (mostly C# with some F# and some C++). In this role, it’s not intended that you will contribute to the core technology. \\n \\n\\n#Salary\\nUS$70000 to US$110000\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

see your&nbsp;kids school plays and games, you can run errands when there's no traffic and so on. &nbsp;So if you are someone who can manage flexibility and still get your stuff done then we are a

and staff. &nbsp;We avoid clients who are not nice people. &nbsp;It's better that way. &nbsp;We are also fairly diverse.

One of the main catalysts for this paradox is that the variety of data that represents a provider is not straight forward nor in one place. The time spent by patients combing through that information on their own can lead to added time in finding the right care.</p><p>On the KyruusOne team, we work hard to minimize mistakes when it comes to getting the data you need. This all starts with rich data sets of provider information that need to be canonicalized, normalized, and transformed into a warehouse that is accessible to all our applications. The team is a collaborative group of software engineers that tackle: provider data models, scalable APIs, intuitive workflows in the UI while tying together the different aspects of data management like bulk editing, canonicalization, and large datasets.</p><p>Join this team to work on the most central part of our applications. Be involved in cross-team discussions as we grow and scale our applications and help design the future of healthcare.</p><p>Here’s what that would mean for you in the Principal Software Engineer role on the Search Team.</p><p><strong><strong>Caring </strong></strong></p><p>You’ll design and write code (lots!) spanning several components to make progress toward assigned tasks on product roadmap and/or planned customer commitments.</p><p><strong><strong>Ownership</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Your typical day will include writing code (lots!) and reviewing others’ code.

We’ve been around since 1991, and we’re still going strong.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.</span></p><p><span>Since we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so.</span></p><p><span>We work remotely all over the United States and Canada. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won’t have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other.</span></p><p><span>Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.</span></p><p><span>Here’s an example of some projects we’ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:</span></p><ul><li><span>Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login</span></li><li><span>Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)</span></li><li><span>Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display</span></li></ul><p><strong>What we want from you: (aka: skills)</strong></p><p><span>We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p>However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.</p><p><strong>Relationship Details:</strong></p><p><span>We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.</span></p><p><span>We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don’t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren’t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project.&nbsp;</span></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/artandlogiccom/view/P_AAAAAAHAAD5CG4WieprX2o?trackingTag=stackOverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Art &amp; Logic, Inc.</h4>            <div><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://artandlogic.com/careers</a></li><li>Visit our Twitter @artandlogic</li></ul></ul>            </div>        ",

We are trying to find ways to describe groups of people mathematically. Some groups with well defined structures are easy, such as a company, government or an army. Others are hard: such as a village, academia or an online community interested in bitcoin. We are interested in the latter.</p>  <p>We believe this project can open the doors to solving the fundamental problems in decentralized systems design.</p>  <p><strong>These will be your tasks</strong></p>  <p>As a backend developer you’ll be responsible for managing things like scheduling background tasks, building API routes for our clients, and collecting and storing data from other APIs for use in our algorithms, all the while logging and fixing errors along the way. If you like working with MVC’s transforming and moving data in creative and efficient ways, this if for you.</p>  <p>We are also constantly finding new scaling challenges as we collect more data and users and need to readjust deployment on our servers. We need to manage communication between services, backups, testing, as well as resource management such as memory.</p>  <p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Intermediate Python</li>   <li>A history of using MVC’s like Django or Rails</li>   <li>Basic MySQL</li>   <li>Docker</li>   <li>Be the type of person who is language independent and enjoys using new tech</li>   <li>Git</li>   <li>Basic crontab</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>AWS</li>   <li>NGINX</li>   <li>Kubernetes</li>   <li>Github and its services</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>We’re offering these benefits</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Work on hard &amp; fundamental problems</li>   <li>Equity options</li>   <li>Work from home or office or a cafe (whatever you prefer!)</li>   <li>Work visa sponsorship to Germany (if you wish to relocate)</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>How we work</strong></p>  <p>We are mostly a distributed team of 5 and growing. Most of the team members are located in Europe.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Choose your location:</strong> It would be ideal for you to work with the team in Berlin and we are happy to sponsor a German Work Visa for you. If it is not possible for you to work from Berlin we can also offer that you work remotely.</li>   <li><strong>Regular off-sites:</strong> At least every quarter we make a point for the team to meet in person and work together for a couple of days. We typically rent a big house where we live and work for several days.</li>   <li><strong>Communication:</strong> We use the following tools at work: Slack for instant messaging Asana for task management Standup Alice (Slack bot) for weekly stand-ups 1:1 calls on per need basis</li>   <li><strong>Working time:</strong> We currently do not track your hours worked (eg. Mon-Fri 9-5) however we do expect you deliver results on tasks. We do expect that you will be available on Slack in the afternoon, Central European Time (GMT+1).</li>   <li><strong>Office:</strong> Most of us currently work remotely from home, cafés etc. and you are welcome to do the same. If you work with us in Berlin you can join us in our coworking space to get more of an “office culture”.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Culture of Critical Thinking</strong></p>  <p>One of the biggest risks we face is that we can fool ourselves into believing that we got something to work when we in fact did not. This is because verifying accuracy of our algorithm’s outputs takes a long time and significant infrastructure. This means that an experiment that was not well-thought through enough can lead us to wasting months of work. We cannot afford that. For this reason, it is essential that we build a culture around critical thinking and closely follow the scientific method.</p>  <p>If you are not familiar with Critical Thinking &amp; the Scientific Method, we encourage you to watch the following videos before having a chat with us:</p>  <p>Critical Thinking Course</p>  <p>Richard Feynman discussing the Scientific Method</p>  <p><strong>Big no-no’s</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Calls to authority (“I’ve been doing this for 20 years and you’re just an intern, we’ll do it my way”; “world’s top experts agree that…”)</li>   <li>Discrediting ideas based on their public perception (“If you think that you are a X, Y, Z”)</li>  </ul>  <p>Please include your GitHub account or some kind of portfolio of works within your CV/resume.</p> </div><a href='https://hive.join.com/jobs/292604-backend-developer?pid=98c1261599ca17c51388&amp;utm_source=berlinstartupjobs&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=singlepostingstandard&amp;utm_content=backenddeveloper' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this position</a>",

Home care is supported by some of the most powerful macro factors affecting the global economy: (1) the largest demographic shift in human history; (2) a shift in the $3 trillion dollar healthcare industry from fee-for-service to value-based care, which has expanded reimbursement for home care services; and (3) advancements in telehealth which enable the shift of healthcare from traditional clinical environments to the home.<br> <br><br> <br>Of the over 18 million seniors currently needing home care, 6 million receive care from family members and 1.5 million receive care through home care agencies. Our aging population drives the growth of the home care industry, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day. On top of this core growth, health insurers and other payers are increasingly reimbursing for home care, thus driving an increase in the percentage of seniors that can afford home care and driving an increase from the 1.5 million who receive home care today into the 18 million seniors that need home care in order to stay independent and age-in-place. Over 90% of seniors want to age-in-place: not only is it the most desired outcome, but it is also the most cost-effective.<br> <br><br> <br>Despite tremendous growth, the home care industry, along with the seniors and families it serves, faces numerous challenges. Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.<br> <br><br> <br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.<br> <br><br> <br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.<br> <br><br> <br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the \\&quot;virtual nervous system\\&quot; for the \\&quot;last mile\\&quot; of care for the world's<br> <br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.<br> <br><br> <br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.<br> <br><br> <br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.<br> <br><br> <br>**Top Reasons to Work with Us**<br> <br><br> <br>WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME<br> <br><br> <br>**What You Will Be Doing**<br> <br><br> <br>Build and design a scalable technology stack<br> <br>Approach challenges proactively<br> <br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions<br> <br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership<br> <br>Triage and fix bugs in code<br> <br>Effectively QA and test code<br> <br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)<br> <br><br> <br>**What You Need for this Position**<br> <br><br> <br>Entrepreneurial mindset required<br> <br>Prior experience building an application from scratch<br> <br>Prior Start-up Experience Required<br> <br>Extensive Python/Django experience<br> <br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)<br> <br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction<br> <br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem<br> <br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense<br> <br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus<br> <br>Machine Learning skills is a plus<br> <br><br> <br>- Python<br> <br>- Django<br> <br>- PostgreSQL<br> <br>- Redis<br> <br>- Celery<br> <br>- RabbitMQ<br> <br>- Angular.js<br> <br>- AWS<br> <br>- Startup Experience<br> <br>- JavaScript<br> <br><br> <br>**What's In It for You**<br> <br><br> <br>-Base Salary<br> <br>- Vacation/PTO<br> <br>- Medical<br> <br>- Dental<br> <br>- Vision<br> <br>- Bonus<br> <br>- 401k<br> <br>- Equity Share<br> <br><br> <br>So, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!<br> <br><br> <br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.<br> <br><br> <br><br><br> **CyberCoders, Inc is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer** <br><br><br> <br><br> <br><br><br>All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.<br><br><br> <br><br> <br><br><br> **Your Right to Work** - In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification document form upon hire.<br><br>*REMOTE CTO - Python, Django, PostgreSQL*<br>*CO-Denver*<br>*CD-1535069* <br> Associated topics: agile, c, chief technology officer, db2, information technology infrastructure library, j2ee, operating system, shell, software development, software manager</div>",

We currently do it in domains as diverse as education and specialised med-tech. Most of our projects start from scratch - an empty .js file or a whiteboard - and it is up to the creativity and technical talent of our team to come up with a great solution.</p><br /><p class=&quot;MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph&quot;>We believe in maximising the freedom of our team members. This means not only location independence and flexible hours, but also freedom to take ownership of projects, and to organise your work in a way that best supports your strengths. Besides freedom, we also believe in taking responsibility. All of us care deeply about building products that exceed the expectations of our clients and their users, and we are not afraid of working hard when it matters.</p><br /><p class=&quot;MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph&quot;>CodeLeap is not only a team of people with a passion for technology, we are proper geeks. As soon as we received our first client payment, we did the most reasonable thing we could think of: we got an Oculus. Outside of work, each of us enjoys being creative and curious - building software tools, DIY robots, playing musical instruments or weird video games.</p><br /><p class=&quot;MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph&quot;>If this sounds like the team you&rsquo;d like to join, reach out! We are a young, early stage business, and you could play a very meaningful role in shaping our future.

    "content": "<div>\n Minimum Required Skills:\n <br>Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ, Angular.js, AWS, Startup Experience, JavaScript\n <br>\n <br>If you are a CTO with experience, please read on!\n <br>\n <br>Home care is a rapidly growing $72 billion dollar industry in the United States serving over 1.5 million people. Home care is supported by some of the most powerful macro factors affecting the global economy: (1) the largest demographic shift in human history; (2) a shift in the $3 trillion dollar healthcare industry from fee-for-service to value-based care, which has expanded reimbursement for home care services; and (3) advancements in telehealth which enable the shift of healthcare from traditional clinical environments to the home.\n <br>\n <br>Of the over 18 million seniors currently needing home care, 6 million receive care from family members and 1.5 million receive care through home care agencies. Our aging population drives the growth of the home care industry, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day. On top of this core growth, health insurers and other payers are increasingly reimbursing for home care, thus driving an increase in the percentage of seniors that can afford home care and driving an increase from the 1.5 million who receive home care today into the 18 million seniors that need home care in order to stay independent and age-in-place. Over 90% of seniors want to age-in-place: not only is it the most desired outcome, but it is also the most cost-effective.\n <br>\n <br>Despite tremendous growth, the home care industry, along with the seniors and families it serves, faces numerous challenges. Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.\n <br>\n <br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.\n <br>\n <br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.\n <br>\n <br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the virtual nervous system for the last mile of care for the world's\n <br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.\n <br>\n <br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.\n <br>\n <br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.\n <br>\n <br>Top Reasons to Work with Us\n <br>\n <br>WORK REMOTELY\n <br>\n <br>What You Will Be Doing\n <br>\n <br>Build and design a scalable technology stack\n <br>Approach challenges proactively\n <br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions\n <br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership\n <br>Triage and fix bugs in code\n <br>Effectively QA and test code\n <br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)\n <br>\n <br>What You Need for this Position\n <br>\n <br>Entrepreneurial mindset required\n <br>Prior experience building an application from scratch\n <br>Prior Start-up Experience Required\n <br>Extensive Python/Django experience\n <br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)\n <br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction\n <br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem\n <br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense\n <br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus\n <br>Machine Learning skills is a plus\n <br>\n <br>- Python\n <br>- Django\n <br>- PostgreSQL\n <br>- Redis\n <br>- Celery\n <br>- RabbitMQ\n <br>- Angular.js\n <br>- AWS\n <br>- Startup Experience\n <br>- JavaScript\n <br>\n <br>What's In It for You\n <br>\n <br>-Base Salary \n <br>- Vacation/PTO\n <br>- Medical\n <br>- Dental\n <br>- Vision\n <br>- Bonus\n <br>- 401k\n <br>- Equity ShareSo, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!\n <br>\n <br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.\n <br>\n <br>Security Clearance will be needed - therefore, only US citizens can be considered.Please apply directly to by clicking 'Click Here to Apply' with your Word resume!\n <br>\n <br>Looking forward to receiving your resume and going over the position in more detail with you.\n <br>\n <br>- Not a fit for this position?

Home care is supported by some of the most powerful macro factors affecting the global economy: (1) the largest demographic shift in human history; (2) a shift in the $3 trillion dollar healthcare industry from fee-for-service to value-based care, which has expanded reimbursement for home care services; and (3) advancements in telehealth which enable the shift of healthcare from traditional clinical environments to the home.\n <br>\n <br>Of the over 18 million seniors currently needing home care, 6 million receive care from family members and 1.5 million receive care through home care agencies. Our aging population drives the growth of the home care industry, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day. On top of this core growth, health insurers and other payers are increasingly reimbursing for home care, thus driving an increase in the percentage of seniors that can afford home care and driving an increase from the 1.5 million who receive home care today into the 18 million seniors that need home care in order to stay independent and age-in-place. Over 90% of seniors want to age-in-place: not only is it the most desired outcome, but it is also the most cost-effective.\n <br>\n <br>Despite tremendous growth, the home care industry, along with the seniors and families it serves, faces numerous challenges. Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.\n <br>\n <br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.\n <br>\n <br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.\n <br>\n <br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the virtual nervous system for the last mile of care for the world's\n <br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.\n <br>\n <br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.\n <br>\n <br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.\n <br>\n <br>Top Reasons to Work with Us\n <br>\n <br>WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME\n <br>\n <br>What You Will Be Doing\n <br>\n <br>Build and design a scalable technology stack\n <br>Approach challenges proactively\n <br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions\n <br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership\n <br>Triage and fix bugs in code\n <br>Effectively QA and test code\n <br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)\n <br>\n <br>What You Need for this Position\n <br>\n <br>Entrepreneurial mindset required\n <br>Prior experience building an application from scratch\n <br>Prior Start-up Experience Required\n <br>Extensive Python/Django experience\n <br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)\n <br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction\n <br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem\n <br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense\n <br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus\n <br>Machine Learning skills is a plus\n <br>\n <br>- Python\n <br>- Django\n <br>- PostgreSQL\n <br>- Redis\n <br>- Celery\n <br>- RabbitMQ\n <br>- Angular.js\n <br>- AWS\n <br>- Startup Experience\n <br>- JavaScript\n <br>\n <br>What's In It for You\n <br>\n <br>-Base Salary \n <br>- Vacation/PTO\n <br>- Medical\n <br>- Dental\n <br>- Vision\n <br>- Bonus\n <br>- 401k\n <br>- Equity ShareSo, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!\n <br>\n <br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.\n <br>\n <br>Security Clearance will be needed - therefore, only US citizens can be considered.Please apply directly to by clicking 'Click Here to Apply' with your Word resume!\n <br>\n <br>Looking forward to receiving your resume and going over the position in more detail with you.\n <br>\n <br>- Not a fit for this position?
