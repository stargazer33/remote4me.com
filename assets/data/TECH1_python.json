Towards this goal, we partner with many organizations in the social sector and provide them with tools and services related to research and evaluation, surveys, modeling and simulation as well as custom tailored software. Our team is distributed over offices in the US and Africa, part of our team is working 100% remotely. Kimetrica is seeking a REMOTE Full-Stack Python/ Django Software Developer to design and develop software models and applications, and undertake managerial tasks that facilitate software development. These applications will support statistical data capture, analysis, mapping, and visualizations. OUR TECH STACK: Our tech stack is mostly Python-based, because Python provides unparalleled productivity and a strong ecosystem, especially in scientific computing and data sciences. Most of our software solutions are implemented as web applications, with a strong preference for Django/Django Rest framework. Important packages we use are Pandas, Celery, black, flake8 among many others. We use AWS for deployments, leveraging Docker images and ECS, as well as Gitlab for our source code and Gitlab CI for CI/CD. Our RDBMS of choice is PostgreSQL. On the front-end, our framework of choice is React. We try to adhere to Agile Software Development Principles and SCRUM and currently use Easy Redmine as our issue tracker, but we will be transitioning to Jira. WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR: You are a Software Developer (Over 5 years of work experience) with extensive experience in Django and Django Rest framework, implementing REST APIs with a strong emphasis on testing and documentation. You are passionate about writing high-quality code (we use black to auto-format our code and flake8 for linting). You have experience with Docker to help with deployments (DevOps) and ideally Gitlab CI and AWS (ECS a strong plus). You are familiar with Unix-like development systems, you are able to work with RDBMS and you have knowledge using the command line. You are willing to take initiative, you are responsible and able to self-organize and you have good communication skills, to be able to work in a distributed team. As a Software Developer, you take part in code reviews, following a Merge Request based workflow, you resolve conflicts and support fellow developers with meaningful feedback and constructive criticism. A big part of your work consists of developing well-written back-end code. You work on new features and products that include designing the architecture as well as resolving software defects. You write unit tests to prove that code works as intended and protect against regressions. You are eager to learn new technologies and able to tackle problems independently. You communicate your findings and share your knowledge with your colleagues. Part of your time is devoted to coaching junior developers and answering their questions. Experience with statistical data capture, analysis, mapping and visualizations is not required, but would greatly enhance your qualifications for the position. REQUIRED SKILLS: Python, Django, Django Rest framework, Unit tests, Git, Merge Requests, Docker, Bash (at least basic knowledge) NICE TO HAVE: AWS (ECS), Pandas, React, [Easy] Redmine, Superset, CKAN, Celery, Sentry, PostGIS, Redis,Sphinx, MyPy, KoBo, Mayan EDMS, Visualization JOB TYPE: Remote JOB CATEGORY: Permanent / Full Time SALARY RANGE: $90,000.00 to $110,000.00 Yearly</div>",

For this role we are looking for a &quot;full stack&quot; generalist who has the experience and interest to be our team's frontend expert.</strong></p><p>Zymergen’s Automation team is building the technology for a reconfigurable, highly automated <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbXOIuTvEJ8' rel='nofollow'><em>industrial microbe factory</em></a>. Combined with the work done by our colleagues who are geneticists, data scientists, research associates, and many other disciplines, our work leads to new chemicals with properties <a href='https://youtu.be/1X9Npq2eQxo?t=275' rel='nofollow'><em>unlike anything that can be derived from petroleum</em></a>.</p><h4><strong>ABOUT THE JOB</strong></h4><p>You will contribute to the code that controls the many different <a href='https://medium.com/@ZymergenTechBlog/the-case-for-modular-lab-automation-c34f214e1276' rel='nofollow'><em>types of machinery that make up our microbe factory</em></a>, adding support for new equipment types, improving the user interfaces for scientists, scaling the scheduling software to support larger transport systems, improving observability tools to monitor the factory, and generally working towards support for more complex automated workflows.</p><p>We call this role “Software Engineer” and not “Automation Engineer” on purpose: Our tech stack combines a modern web tech stack with a few cherry-picked components you’d find in a traditional process control system. Our codebase currently contains REST APIs served by Django apps, Vue.js for user interfaces (and simple Django forms with sprinkles of jQuery for others), Python’s asyncio in worker processes, and a collection of device drivers (also written in Python). Our infrastructure includes Kubernetes, Puppet-managed EC2 nodes, Kafka, MySQL, as well as a few Windows machines and PLCs.</p><p>The project you will start on has been in flight for two years. Some days you will be working on a brand new service to add a major new feature. On other days you will be fixing bugs or troubleshooting misbehaving robots in production (you might be wearing a lab coat). We use two-week sprints to structure our work, with every team member being responsible for keeping track of one or two ongoing efforts. Who works on what is driven just as much by our current skills as by what we want to learn.</p><p>One specific area our team is trying to get better at is frontend development and we hope that you can play a role in that. Be prepared to spend 50% or more of your time designing and implementing user interfaces. All our users are internal to Zymergen: They include scientists who need to tell the robots what to work on, support engineers who troubleshoot misbehaving robots, and managers who rely on <a href='https://medium.com/@ZymergenTechBlog/visualizing-automation-usage-at-zymergen-970440a58568' rel='nofollow'><em>utilization data from our dashboards</em></a>.</p><h4><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></h4><p>You have several years of experience working in technical software development role (SWE, SRE, web dev, etc). We do not expect you to have prior experience in the biotech industry or in working with robots. To make sure we can get you up to speed quickly on those things, you’ll need to bring a solid fundamental knowledge and recent hands-on experience with software development, working in a team, and the two foundational languages in our tech stack: Javascript and Python.</p><p>You might have a CS degree, or not. (If you do, you would be the first team member who has one.) We want to hear the stories about how you used your skills in thoughtful and interesting ways, whether you learned them in a school or elsewhere.</p><p>We are looking for a software engineer who cares about the product we are building at least as much as the code they are writing. Nobody gets micromanaged in our team, even junior engineers own complete problems and participate in architecture decisions and project management. Because you join the team as an experienced engineer, we expect you to be comfortable dealing with ambiguity and ready to mentor others to become excellent at it too.</p><p>In addition to writing code every day, you will review the work of others both at the design and implementation stage, design significant new features and infrastructure from scratch, and help maintain and prioritize our backlog and road map. When we deploy our work to a prototype system, you will be hands on with testing and troubleshooting, even in situations when it’s not clear if the problem is software or hardware or biology.</p><p>You will be the sixth member of a team of people who are excited to both introduce you to our tech and to learn from you! When you arrive, we will have an onboarding plan that gets you ready for working on critical path features and the gnarliest bugs within two or three months. We will save you a spot in the schedule for our biweekly chalk talk lineup, too!</p><p>A note on logistics: This is <em>not</em> a remote job. At least some of your work will involve (expensive!) machines which are located in our laboratories in Emeryville, CA. Emeryville is one of the biotech hubs in the Bay Area’s “tech industry” and easy to commute to: Zymergites bicycle or ride public transit from Berkeley and Oakland, take the train or company shuttle from the South Bay, and BART or drive from SF. We don’t have fixed working hours: Most of us meet in the office on most weekdays. Most meetings happen between 11am and 4pm, if you work from home you can always videocall in.</p><p>Legal authorization to work in the U.S. is required. Zymergen may agree to sponsor an individual for an employment visa now or in the future if there is a shortage of individuals with particular skills for this job. In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification form upon hire.</p>                </div><a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_app?for=zymergen&amp;token=1754529' rel='nofollow'>Apply now!</a>",

We're really proud of the product we've built, are getting great response from our users and the theatre industry and have had over 3k users in just a few weeks. We have a clear, exciting roadmap of enhancements and innovations ahead of us and are looking to add more bench strength to an already strong team so we can accelerate progress. </p><p>Our team:</p><p>We're a pretty focused and skilled bunch (ex-Amazon, Adidas, fintech, BBC, etc.), based in London. We love feedback and collaboration and have lots of exciting problems to solve, so would love to find someone that cares about our mission: to remove barriers-to-entry for potential theatre-goers and be the most trusted way to access theatre. We're based in London's South Bank and have weekday access to a stunning, unique co-working space.</p><p>You:</p><p>Ideally you care deeply about clean code, scalable solutions and delivering scrappy but error-free enhancements for users. So ideally looking for someone with deep experience in quickly implementing straightforward solutions. We are not interested in hiring a dispersed remote team that we can't get to know or actively collaborate with - we need you to bring your passion, problem-solving and curiosity to our work. Our diversity of perspectives helps us find and implement the best solutions. Ideally you have deep experience in React and single-page web apps, and experience/willingness to dive in on Next.js. Backend is Python/Django, infrastructure is AWS and we're very open to full-stack generalists provided the frontend skills are strong. Experience with Auth0, Prismic CMS, FB social plugin integrations, or SendGrid/email all helpful as well.</p><p>Where we're at:</p><p>Our beta is exceeding all expectations so we've doubled down on speed, and thus posting this role. Exciting times. Thespie is a disruptive model in our space, so continuing to improve the platform and deliver on our roadmap is essential - but unrealistic timelines, angst and blame are not part of the equation. We're heads down on building and moving fast because we love what we do, and have big things we need to deliver for theatre-goers.</p><p>If the above sounds like you - or you're excited about what we're doing, please apply and/or connect! We love meeting new people interested in the problems we're solving.</p>",

We're all adults here, so let's talk frankly.\\nWe're a tiny company right now, we only have 1 full-time developer and I work on the code as much as I'm able. We also don’t have amazing/sexy products right now, instead we have a few relatively simple tools that make the lives of IT MSPs a little better than they would be if they didn’t exist. However, we’re also profitable and have a very stable (and growing) income stream. We’re not doing a lot, but what we do we take pride in and do the very best we can.\\nI enjoy helping other people and other businesses be successful. The better job we do at this, the more successful we’ll be.\\nBeing part of a small team has both benefits and drawbacks. Everyone has a voice and everyone is making major contributions to the company’s success. At our size it’s difficult to assign formal job roles; we can’t say that we have a full-time job for just a front-end dev, or devops, but we’ll do our best as a team to get the work that needs to be done to the teammate best suited on getting it done. We can’t match some of the inflated salaries and benefits of many of the venture backed companies, but we’re stable and not worried about our jobs if the next funding round doesn’t happen. We don’t offer unlimited vacation, but we encourage everyone to use all of your vacation every year. We’re looking for long-term success rather than a short term exit. Hopefully some of you will think this sounds appealing.\\nWe’re a fully remote company, and expect to stay that way. I’d rather draw talent from across the whole country, than limit myself to the people in my local area. I’m committed to providing the equipment you need to do your job well, and I expect you to find a workspace that lets you work well (company paid-for coworking is potentially a negotiable option).\\n\\nAbout the role\\nAs a Full Stack Engineer, you’ll be instrumental in our work to add features to our product, improve our platforms, and generally make our code suck less. You will also have the opportunity to help direct the evolution of our technical stack.\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n\\n\\n* Help design and implement the requirements of scalable and reliable systems\\n\\n* Implement software enhancements and suggest improvements\\n\\n* Manage testing and bug fixes\\n\\n* Prepare technical documentation\\n\\n* Collaborate with and support the development team\\n\\n* Coach junior team members (if any)\\n\\n* Communicate key concepts to non-technical team members\\n\\n* Learn new skills and remain up-to-date with development best practices, industry trends, and emerging technologies\\n\\n* Regular video meetings (currently once a week)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* Several years of professional experience with Python development\\n\\n* Experience with test definitions and test-driven development\\n\\n* Understanding of computer science fundamentals\\n\\n* Basic understanding of databases, SQL, concurrency, and parallelism\\n\\n* Comfortable behind a Linux terminal\\n\\n* Critical thinking and problem-solving mindset\\n\\n* Confident verbal and written English\\n\\n* Able to balance pragmatism with planning and long-term thinking\\n\\n* Proactive and self-sufficient\\n\\n* Attention to detail\\n\\n* Leadership skills\\n\\n* BS in Computer Science or relevant field, or can BS it well enough to fool us (IE: have equivalent experience)\\n\\n* Knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes is a plus\\n\\n* Knowledge of the MSP industry is a plus\\n\\n* Knowledge of accounting principles is a plus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow to Apply\\nPlease submit your resume using the application at https://github.com/gozynta/resume_sender\\n(this is the first step of our screening process, to verify that you can at least use git and run a command-line Python application)\\n\\n\\nEEO Statement \\nGozynta, LLC provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for employment and prohibits discrimination and harassment of any type without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.\\nThis policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruiting, hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation and training.  </div> </div>",

Help us build the future of precision forestry. Our clients include NGOs, state and national governmental agencies, and several of the largest forest landowners in the world.\\n\\nOur work has been featured in [The Wall Street Journal,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ai-might-be-used-to-battle-wildfires-11554168366) [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90269483/how-ai-software-could-help-fight-future-wildfires), and the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190226-how-to-bring-wildfires-back-under-control). Through our collaboration with Microsoft as an AI for Earth grantee we’ve been able to create the first ever high resolution nationwide forest inventory, with data for every acre in America. Looking forward, we believe that recent advancements in remote sensing, cloud computing, and AI - combined with deep domain expertise - puts us in a unique position to build the future of forestry. If we ship even half of the things we have planned for 2020, it will be a wild year and we can’t do it without you.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n In this role, you’ll work closely with project managers to help design the next generation of forestry software. We’re a small team, so you’ll be contributing at all levels of the process - from initial UI/UX sketches to phone calls with users in the field about their experience with the new feature.\\n\\nSilviaTerra is a fully remote company, working loosely US hours. Some travel will be required to company meetings (3-4 weeks per year).\\n \\n\\n# Requirements\\nA successful candidate will have the following:\\n\\n* Experience with Python, Docker, and Linux based development\\n* Front end experience - can design product UI/UX. HTML/CSS/Javascript. Has googled “how to vertically center a div” before at least a few times (and knows they will have to again!)\\n* Ability to manage their own work remotely\\n* A highly organized, communicative and collaborative work style\\n\\nWe'd be extra excited if you have:\\n\\n* Experience with React/Redux, Django\\n* Experience building mobile applications\\n* Dev Ops experience. Digital Ocean/AWS/Azure, CI/CD.\\n* General interest in forestry. For this position, we won’t need you to be able to distinguish between a Pine and Spruce (hint: it’s the needles!). We have a separate Biometrics Team for that. However, we hope you can get excited about nature or, at the very least, a good game of Photosynthesis the Board Game. \\n\\n#Location\\n- US-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

We want to democratize capital by making money more accessible for those who need to borrow it and by making investments with strong returns available to those who would like a better financial future.</p><p>We want to help people grow a nest egg even if they think they can’t… and to do it while supporting Main Street, not Wall Street!</p><p>Our first product is a free micro-investment app that helps you save &amp; grow your money – a dollar at a time. It monitors your everyday spending and rounds up each transaction to a whole dollar. It then automatically invests every $10 into a 5% interest earning Worthy Bond, which in turn supports small creditworthy businesses across the U.S., helping to strengthen our local communities.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with offices in sunny Boca Raton, Florida. We avoid the noise of Slack, but we use Twist, Keybase and Confluence to keep in sync. We’re on Gitlab to take advantage of their integrated CI/CD pipeline (we love continuous stuff!) and issue tracker.</p><h4>Who you are</h4><p>You’re an experienced backend web developer who has worked for 5+ years on a few production web apps and APIs at scale. Experience working on financial or accounting applications preferred.</p><p>You use Python on a daily basis for various tasks, from APIs to scheduled tasks and maintenance scripts.</p><p>You can design and implement an API and future-proof it. You have a strong opinion on whether APIs should be versioned in the URI or in a response header, and can defend that opinion. You know how to upgrade an API while keeping it backwards-compatible for older clients.</p><p>You’re aware of which data fits best in a relational database and which in a document-oriented one. You can use a framework-provided ORM, but can also jump in and fine-tune SQL queries when needed. You know enough database management to create and maintain an efficient schema in PostgreSQL, indexes and all.</p><p>You’re experienced enough to avoid most bugs and programming errors, but you use tools such as linters and write unit &amp; integration tests to catch all the others.</p><p>You can secure both internal and public-facing APIs using different methods, including one-time passwords (TOTP) for two-factor authentication. You consider security and privacy when designing any new features or reviewing existing code.</p><p>Most importantly, you can communicate clearly and efficiently in writing, as well as in online video/audio calls. You can handle the async (over)communication requirements of a remote-first environment and can manage your own time and productivity.</p><p>For everyone’s sake, you develop on either OS X or a Linux flavor. We don’t do windows.</p><p>You are eligible to legally work in the U.S. as a full-time employee. Given the role’s responsibilities, this is a hard requirement, even though we will have other positions where we can hire more liberally. Note that this doesn’t require actual presence in the U.S. (expats welcome!).</p><h4>What you’ll do</h4><p>We’ve build a solid, stable serverless API using Zappa on AWS Lambda. Our infrastructure is mostly managed via Terraform and our deployments are one-click, thanks to Gitlab’s CI/CD pipelines. While we rely on third parties for some key features, we’ve never had any downtime caused by anything we wrote.</p><p>Concretely, you’ll help build new business features as we grow our offerings. You will help us trim our backlog and keep technical debt in check. Since we already have robust test coverage, you will help maintain that by writing unit and integration tests for all new features and any bugs fixed.</p><p>You will also perform light devOps duties via Terraform and (rarely) manually, such as Gitlab instance upgrades or bastion security checks and updates. You’ll participate in planning &amp; prioritization meetings to help estimate complexity and think of creative solutions to business and growth problems.</p><p>You are required to have at least basic experience with our existing stack, but more importantly, you need to have the ability and desire to learn and adapt.</p><h4>What you’ll get</h4><ul><li>you can work remote from anywhere in the U.S. or from our office in Boca Raton, FL</li></ul><ul><li>you’ll set your own work schedule, as long as you can deliver and be productive (we prefer two 3-hour focused, uninterrupted work sessions, with morning, lunch and evening communication breaks to stay in sync)</li><li>competitive salary for a remote position</li><li>health insurance &amp; stock options</li><li>more benefits as we continue growing</li></ul><h4>How to apply</h4><p>We don’t do resumes. They only prove who signed your previous paychecks.</p><p>Send us your Git(hub/lab/bucket) profile, places where we can “see” your backend code in production, along with a short email explaining what kinds of problems you solved in the past, and how you did it.</p><p>In essence, please convince us we’re a good fit for each other with any arguments you’d like.</p><p>We’ll contact you by phone or email for a quick chat, then we’ll set up a video call with the CEO and CTO.</p><p>There will be no gimmicky interview quizzes or whiteboard tests. Instead, we’ll ask you to show us some code, either from a previous job or, if NDAs prevent that, we’ll write some together. This is not to test you under pressure, but to filter out the inevitable applicants who are trying to fake it till they make it.</p><p>We’ll ask you to try out something new and talk us through it, whether it’s a new framework, concept (GraphQL instead of REST?) or an AWS service neither of us used before. We do this to see if you’re willing and able to learn new things and how you handle bumping into small obstacles on the way to delivering something that works, however trivial.</p><p></p>  </div>",

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. Diversity drives our vibe. We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>About The Role</strong></strong></p><p>You will be responsible for technical design and work in the Billing area of Elastic’s Cloud product. This area is responsible for services that power Elastic’s SaaS subscription billing platform. This role is very impactful to Elastic -- you will collaborate with partners from Finance, Sales Operations, and IT teams to provide end-to-end billing and invoicing capabilities for our users. You will lead by example and should participate in coding, debugging complex failure scenarios, and triaging bugs. You’ll analyze the current system, participate in roadmap and project planning efforts, and will have ownership for delivering it. You’ll be participating in project management efforts as the teams execute on plans, and you’ll have a role in communicating progress and status to partners.</p><p><strong><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed components and APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is very transparent in our organization. We feel that anyone needs to be in a position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong><strong>Some of the things you'll work on</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Provide technical leadership for the Billing area of Cloud. This includes working on the parts of codebase that brings in monthly subscription revenue from thousands of Elasticsearch Service users.</li><li>Lead the team to help build scalable solutions to deliver the best payments experience for the Elasticsearch Service.</li><li>Own, curate, and execute your area's product roadmap, partnering with product managers, engineering managers, and other peers across Cloud and Elastic teams.</li><li>Understand our company strategy and help to translate it into technical deliverables and guide Cloud’s product direction to realize it.</li><li>Create technical designs and build POCs for new efforts, validating a wild idea works before committing to it.</li><li>Be a contact point in Cloud for other teams within Elastic. Examples include helping Support with difficult cases or consulting with the Sales Operations and IT teams to improve our end to end billing and reporting flow.</li><li>Be hands-on with the codebase. Review work done by the team, and provide constructive feedback.</li><li>Help the team define coding practices and standards.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>What you will bring along&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Proven experience as a software engineer, with a track record of delivering high-quality code.</li><li>Experience with Python as a programming language.</li><li>Comfortable working and communicating with teams from several functions – finance, data analytics, IT, etc.</li><li>Previous experience working with a SaaS platform or product.</li><li>Previous experience providing technical leadership for a team of software engineers.</li><li>Previous experience in an ownership role for roadmap curation and execution.</li><li>Experience gathering or analyzing usage data from hosting providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) is a huge plus.</li><li>Experience working on a SaaS subscription billing platform such as Stripe, Zoura, Recurly is a huge plus.</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><ul><li>Deeply competitive pay and benefits</li><li>Equity compensation</li><li>Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices</li><li>An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life</li><li>Passionate people building phenomenal products</li></ul><p>Elastic is an Equal Employment employer committed to the principles of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action for all applicants and employees.

We want to democratize capital by making money more accessible for those who need to borrow it and by making investments with strong returns available to those who would like a better financial future.</p><p>We want to help people grow a nest egg even if they think they can’t… and to do it while supporting Main Street, not Wall Street!</p><p>Our first product is a free micro-investment app that helps you save &amp; grow your money – a dollar at a time. It monitors your everyday spending and rounds up each transaction to a whole dollar. It then automatically invests every $10 into a 5% interest earning Worthy Bond, which in turn supports small creditworthy businesses across the U.S., helping to strengthen our local communities.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with offices in sunny Boca Raton, Florida. We avoid the noise of Slack, but we use Twist, Keybase and Confluence to keep in sync. We're on Gitlab to take advantage of their integrated CI/CD pipeline (we love continuous stuff!) and issue tracker.</p><h5>Who you are</h5><p>You’re an experienced backend web developer who has worked for 5+ years on a few production web apps and APIs at scale. Experience working on financial or accounting applications preferred.</p><p>You use Python on a daily basis for various tasks, from APIs to scheduled tasks and maintenance scripts.</p><p>You can design and implement an API and future-proof it. You have a strong opinion on whether APIs should be versioned in the URI or in a response header, and can defend that opinion. You know how to upgrade an API while keeping it backwards-compatible for older clients.</p><p>You’re aware of which data fits best in a relational database and which in a document-oriented one. You can use a framework-provided ORM, but can also jump in and fine-tune SQL queries when needed. You know enough database management to create and maintain an efficient schema in PostgreSQL, indexes and all.</p><p>You’re experienced enough to avoid most bugs and programming errors, but you use tools such as linters and write unit &amp; integration tests to catch all the others.</p><p>You can secure both internal and public-facing APIs using different methods, including one-time passwords (TOTP) for two-factor authentication. You consider security and privacy when designing any new features or reviewing existing code.</p><p>Most importantly, you can communicate clearly and efficiently in writing, as well as in online video/audio calls. You can handle the async (over)communication requirements of a remote-first environment and can manage your own time and productivity.</p><p>For everyone’s sake, you develop on either OS X or a Linux flavor. We don’t do windows.</p><p>You are eligible to legally work in the U.S. as a full-time employee. Given the role's responsibilities, this is a hard requirement, even though we will have other positions where we can hire more liberally. Note that this doesn't require actual presence in the U.S. (expats welcome!).</p><h5>What you’ll do</h5><p>We’ve build a solid, stable serverless API using Zappa on AWS Lambda. Our infrastructure is mostly managed via Terraform and our deployments are one-click, thanks to Gitlab’s CI/CD pipelines. While we rely on third parties for some key features, we’ve never had any downtime caused by anything we wrote.</p><p>Concretely, you’ll help build new business features as we grow our offerings. You will help us trim our backlog and keep technical debt in check. Since we already have robust test coverage, you will help maintain that by writing unit and integration tests for all new features and any bugs fixed.</p><p>You will also perform light devOps duties via Terraform and (rarely) manually, such as Gitlab instance upgrades or bastion security checks and updates. You’ll participate in planning &amp; prioritization meetings to help estimate complexity and think of creative solutions to business and growth problems.</p><p>You are required to have at least basic experience with our existing stack, but more importantly, you need to have the ability and desire to learn and adapt.</p><h5>What you’ll get</h5><p>You can work remote from anywhere or from our office in Boca Raton, FL</p><ul><li>you’ll set your own work schedule, as long as you can deliver and be productive (we prefer two 3-hour focused, uninterrupted work sessions, with morning, lunch and evening communication breaks to stay in sync)</li><li>competitive salary for a remote position</li><li>health insurance &amp; stock options</li><li>more benefits as we continue growing</li></ul><p></p>                      <h4>Desired Skills</h4>            <ul>                              <li><span>Amazon Web Services</span></li>                              <li><span>Celery</span></li>                              <li><span>Flask</span></li>                              <li><span>PostgreSQL</span></li>                              <li><span>Terraform</span></li>                          </ul>                                <h4>How to Apply</h4>            <p></p><p>We don’t do resumes. They only prove who signed your previous paychecks.</p><p>Send us your Git(hub/lab/bucket) profile, places where we can &quot;see&quot; your backend code in production, along with a short email explaining what kinds of problems you solved in the past, and how you did it.</p><p>In essence, please convince us we’re a good fit for each other with any arguments you’d like.</p><p>We’ll contact you by phone or email for a quick chat, then we’ll set up a video call with the CEO and CTO.</p><p>There will be no gimmicky interview quizzes or whiteboard tests. Instead, we’ll ask you to show us some code, either from a previous job or, if NDAs prevent that, we’ll write some together. This is not to test you under pressure, but to filter out the inevitable applicants who are trying to fake it till they make it.</p><p>We’ll ask you to try out something new and talk us through it, whether it’s a new framework, concept (GraphQL instead of REST?) or an AWS service neither of us used before. We do this to see if you’re willing and able to learn new things and how you handle bumping into small obstacles on the way to delivering something that works, however trivial.</p><p></p>                                <h4>Contact Info</h4>            <ul>                                          <li><strong>Company Website:</strong> <a href='https://worthybonds.com' rel='nofollow'>https://worthybonds.com</a></li>            </ul>                  </div><a href='https://worthy-financial.breezy.hr/p/41fc2b92488301-senior-python-backend-developer' rel='nofollow'>Apply</a>",
