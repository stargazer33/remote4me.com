We started out as a software development consulting company way back in 2000, developing performance test and measurement software for customers such as Nasdaq and the European space agency. We wrote both hardcore, low-level networking software and high-level web user interfaces and became quite good at both of those things. We pride ourselves on understanding the lower levels of a networked application while at the same time realizing how incredibly important UX is.

We are made of many small teams that are broadly distributed across the US, featuring tightly collaborative groups of developers, designers, and product managers constantly encouraging each other to deliver work that instills pride and fulfillment.</p><p>Our developers are organized into a network of small teams with embedded product managers, designers, and front-end specialists focused on specific functional areas. &nbsp;We believe deeply in automated testing, code review, and iterative improvement. We are in the midst of a transition from a monolithic web application to a microservices ecosystem, and welcome individuals who’ve made that journey before or are interested in starting it with us.</p><p>Our team is located in the United States. We happily support a variety of employees who connect remotely from the American South, the Pacific Northwest, New England, and the Midwest, as well as those who come into our offices in Boston or Sebastopol, CA but we cannot offer full time employment to those who live and operate outside of the United States.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>Our backend engineers are focused on building a diverse family of scalable and robust micro-services, aimed at a variety of educational audiences. &nbsp;Software engineers work in two week sprints, maintaining a balance between building new features and maintaining older ones. New features are designed in collaboration with product managers and other teammates. Engineers exchange code reviews with other team members, provide mentorship to junior engineers, and assist QA and Ops in troubleshooting product issues.</p><p>Our primary backend platform is based on Python and Django and is supported by PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Solr. We also utilize Ruby on Rails in some key applications. Many of our applications and services are dockerized and deployed into Kubernetes clusters by Jenkins. While your focus will be on backend work, sometimes you will be called upon to make changes to our front-end codebase, which is based on Javascript (ES6), React, and Redux.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>We are interested in people who have experience building and supporting web applications with a diverse and engaged user base. &nbsp;We desire candidates who work comfortably in an agile environment and with collaborators who are distributed across multiple time zones. &nbsp;We value colleagues who are helpful, respectful, humble, and always willing to do what’s best for our users. We desire developers who treat automated tests as essential, and believe that code reviews are a crucial path of learning and of sharing knowledge. The women and men of our platform team have taken many traditional and nontraditional paths to the developer profession, and we welcome diverse teams that are bound together by a mutual love of learning.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>2 years of experience developing web applications and services</li><li>Demonstrated competency with Python and Django</li><li>Experience building and maintaining RESTful APIs</li><li>Experience with automated testing and test-driven development</li><li>Experience with continuous integration tools and a rapid release cycle</li></ul><p><strong>Experience Bonuses</strong></p><ul><li>Django-REST-Framework</li><li>Celery</li><li>React and Redux</li><li>Docker</li><li>Kubernetes</li><li>Microservice architecture</li><li>RabbitMQ or similar messaging system</li><li>Node.js</li><li>Scrum</li><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Go</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://app.jobvite.com/j?cj=o97b8fwj&amp;s=Stack_Overflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About O'Reilly Media</h3>            <div><p><strong>Inspiring the future for more than 40 years</strong></p><p>We share the knowledge and teach the skills people need to change their world.

    "content": "<h2>ABOUT US</h2><p><strong>We’re building tools to bring about an open science revolution.</strong></p><p>Impactstory began life as a hackathon project. As the hackathon ended, a few of us migrated into the hotel hallway to continue working, completing the prototype as the hotel started waking up for breakfast. Months of spare-time development followed, then funding. That was five years ago — we’ve got the same excitement for Impactstory today.</p><p>We’ve also got great momentum.  The scientific journal <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05968-3' rel='nofollow'>Nature recently profiled Unpaywall, our main product</a>:  “Unpaywall has become indispensable to many academics, and tie-ins with established scientific search engines could broaden its reach.”  We’re making solid revenue, and it’s time to expand our team.</p><p>We’re passionate about open science, and we run our non-profit company openly too.  All of our code is open source, we make our data as open as possible, and we post our grant proposals so that everyone can see both our successful and our unsuccessful ones.  We try to be the change we want to see </p><h2>ABOUT THE POSITION</h2><p>The position is lead dev for Unpaywall, our index of all the free-to-read scholarly papers in the world. Because Unpaywall is surfacing millions of formerly inaccessible open-access scientific papers, it’s growing very quickly, both in terms of usage and revenue. We think it’s a really transformative piece of infrastructure that will enable entire new classes of tools to improve science communication. As a nonprofit, that’s our aim.</p><p>We’re looking for someone to take the lead on the tech parts of <a href='https://unpaywall.org/' rel='nofollow'>Unpaywall</a>.  <strong>You must have 5+ years of experience with both Python and SQL (we use PostgreSQL), and experience with directly maintaining and enhancing a production system.</strong>  But more importantly, we’re looking for someone who is smart, dedicated, and gets things done! As an early team member you will play a key role in the company as we grow.</p><p>The position is remote, with flexible working hours, and plenty of vacation time.  We are a small team so tell us what benefits are important to you and we’ll make them happen.  We're a nonprofit, so no stock options.</p><h2>OUR TEAM</h2><p>We’re at about a million dollars of revenue (grants and earned income) with just two employees: the two co-founders.  We value kindness, honesty, grit, and smarts. We’re taking our time on this hire, holding out for just the right person.</p><h2>HOW TO APPLY</h2><p>Sound like you?  Email to <a href='mailto:team@impactstory.org' rel='nofollow'>team@impactstory.org</a> with (1) what appeals to you about this specific job (this part is important to us), (2) a brief summary of your experience with directly maintaining and enhancing a production system (3) a copy of your resume or inkedin profile and (4) a link to your github profile.  Thanks!</p><p>No agencies or consultancies please!</p>",

Because Unpaywall is surfacing millions of formerly inaccessible open-access scientific papers, it’s growing very quickly, both in terms of usage and revenue.

We are a small team so tell us what benefits are important to you and we’ll make them happen.

The ideal candidate will have top Python skills and a passion for delivering high quality code.</p>  <p>You will be joining a strong group of devs within the Ocean Protocol Development team, closely working with other engineers and researchers.</p>  <p>At Ocean Protocol we like problems that are difficult to solve, but we also really we like high-quality code, enjoyable documentation, and efficient solutions.</p>  <p><strong>What we need from you?</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Create high quality, highly maintainable, highly performant, and highly scalable decentralized components for various use cases</li>   <li>Assist in architecting and developing applications and features of the Ocean Protocol product</li>   <li>Create microservices and APIs</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Skills and Experience…</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Design, develop, test, deploy, maintain and improve high-quality software</li>   <li>Strong Python skills, more than 8 years of experience</li>   <li>Solid object-oriented programming understanding</li>   <li>Test Driven Development (TDD) experience</li>   <li>Experience with Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)</li>   <li>Cloud Integration – Storage and Compute (Azure, AWS, GCP, etc.)</li>   <li>Desired experience with Ethereum and Web3</li>   <li>Desired experience in cryptography</li>   <li>Desired experience in blockchain technology</li>   <li>Team player</li>   <li>Leadership and mentoring to a dynamic and diverse development team</li>   <li>Provide effort and technical scoping for customer proposals</li>   <li>Technical leadership in the delivery of development projects</li>   <li>Fluent in English (oral and written)</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>About the Ocean Protocol Team</strong></p>  <p>We’re a tight-knit international team based in Berlin. We’re always building and shipping, but with an appreciation for the theoretical. We work closely with our users, technology partners, and engage with the global decentralization community on and offline.</p>  <p>From our very beginnings having a female cofounder: we are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We strongly encourage applications from women, transgender or non-binary people, people of color, people with disabilities, or anyone traditionally underrepresented in tech.</p>  <p><em>Location:</em> We’re in Berlin, Germany. If you don’t know much about Berlin, don’t fret. Almost all of us have immigrated here, from all over the world, from Canada to India, from Italy to USA. And we love it!</p>  <p><em>Office time:</em> We trust you to do your job, and doing your job is about getting the task done, not us looking over your shoulder. In general we try to be around the office here in Berlin but as with our technology, our team is often distributed and our processes are optimized so work can get done in a mix of on-site and remote work. If you feel you’re most effective working from a top of a mountain, please do.</p>  <p><em>Choice of tech:</em> We provide you with either a top-notch Dell or MacBook Pro laptop, and with everything else you need and chose to get your work done.</p>  <p><em>Immigration:</em> We’ll hold your hand in the visa / immigration process, which is smooth and surprisingly fast.</p>  <p><em>Language:</em> We speak English in the office. And in fact if you only speak English, you can easily get by in Berlin. (As is the case for many of our employees.)</p>  <p><em>Transit:</em> We’re spoiled, Berlin has one of the best public transit systems in the world. Our office is near a connection point of the underground (U-bahn) and trams. Berlin also has safe bike lines all throughout the city; you can park your bike in the office. We offer to reimburse half of you annual public transport ticket.</p>  <p><em>Time off:</em> Health first. Without health and happiness, what is left? So, our minimum paid leave per year is 25 days, plus statutory national holidays.</p>  <p><em>Health Benefits:</em> Germany has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. Some of the nation’s top university hospitals are here in Berlin. Many of us have a family doctor just down the street from our office. Berlin is also great for sports.</p>  <p><em>Parenting, Parental Leave:</em> We love kids! And we recognize the time that parents need for their children’s’ well-being, not to mention their own well-being! So we want to give all the space in the world to new parents who wish to spend time with their children: mothers get fully paid maternity leave six weeks prior to birth and eight weeks after. In addition, there are 14 months of 2/3 paid leave, split between the parents according to the parents’ choice. And for general parental responsibilities that invariably come up, by all means, go attend to your child. We trust that you are a professional and know how to balance your time.</p>  <p><em>Professional and Personal Growth:</em> Ocean Protocol is at the epicenter of blockchains + big data + AI, so if you’re not learning, then something’s wrong! We’ll be giving you opportunities to represent us speaking at conferences, hosting hackathons, writing, and more. Finally, we give you an annual self-development budget that you choose as you wish to spend on books, personal conferences, and other things to grow yourself.</p>  <p><strong>Your next step?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Are you up for working in an awesome team, learning a ton, and bringing blockchain to the masses?

The tech stack is pretty standard - Django and React, with GitLab for tracking issues, code reviews, etc. It's the cryptocurrency part that's exciting: communication with wallets, daemons, and other crypto APIs. In a super secure manner, because we are dealing with other people's money!</p><p>We could even say that the tech stack is secondary. We are looking for sharp people, who are capable of learning how to deal with the inherent complexity of crypto. We haven't touched the blockchain itself yet, but things like block confirmations or transaction fees are our daily bread (don't worry, we'll teach you).</p><p>Even though Cryptosphere Systems is a fully remote company, we understand the importance of looking after our employees.

We're bringing world class research into the classrooms. You're working on making our speech platform scale for thousands of pupils practicing their pronunciation in realtime. Our backend consists of C++ for the heavy lifting (speech processing using Deep Neural Networks) with a user facing Python API (REST + websockets). Along with scaling up, you'll add new features and fix bugs (in reverse order, obviously ). You'll be working with our researchers on one side and the frontend developers that create and use our JS SDK interfacing with the Python backend. Your main responsibility will be backend, but since you work in a startup, it's very useful if you know some JS so you can adapt the JS SDK yourself sometimes. We don't have the luxury of a big front- and backend team, yet… </p><p>We expect&nbsp;<strong>from you</strong></p><p>Do you also get butterflies in your stomach when you think of developing awesome C++ and Python code? Are you able to switch easily between the two of them, but more importantly, do you like that? Are you interested in real-time audio, squeezing out performance gains across the whole stack? Are you a keen learner and do you like tinkering with the latest web technology?</p><p>You know your way around in software development. You know the definition of done is not “hey, works on my machine!” so you don’t hesitate to actually test your software using our frontend code as well. You are able to give but also receive code reviews and understand how that helps in being a better professional.</p><p>Does that sound like you? Ready to expand your horizons? Then you will definitely have an interesting time with us!</p><p>You’ll be joining a friendly environment in which you don’t have to be afraid to speak your mind or ask permission about how you think you should get something done. As long as your goal aligns with that of the team: get things done!</p><p><strong>Your skills</strong></p><ul><li>You've got &gt;5&nbsp;years of experience in C++</li><li>You've got &gt;5&nbsp;years of experience in Python</li><li>You've got experience in cloud deployments</li><li>You're not someone who waits until told what to do but contributes and takes initiative</li><li>Experience with JavaScript is a plus</li><li>Fluent in English speaking/wording.

X-Team is a community of like-minded individuals, carefully chosen to ensure that they can become part of the community of the most motivated people in the world who come together to unleash their potential. What we've created is truly special and not merely a faceless platform. X-Team is where developers go to feel truly at home together while becoming more motivated than they've ever been.<br><strong><br>How long does your vetting/interview process take?</strong></p><p>It varies depending on our immediate needs and how quickly you respond to our questions and requests. On average, it takes 1-3 weeks.</p><p>More importantly though, after a decade of interviewing developers, we've learned how important it is to respect people's time. We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p><p><strong>Will I get a job immediately after applying?</strong></p><p>If your skills, experience, and values align with a current opening we have, your chances of getting hired immediately are high. If we discover you're qualified, but all opportunities have been taken, we'll continue to work with you to help you get a role in X-Team.

A real-time content measurement layer for the entire web.</p><p>Parse.ly is trusted by over 400 enterprises, used by over 3,000 high-traffic websites, and has tens of thousands of active user seats. We are an established, but quickly-growing, company with a 30+ person product + engineering + design team, sitting inside a 70+ person company. We have millions of dollars in revenue.</p><p>We have two products. Parse.ly Analytics (<a href='https://parse.ly/analytics' rel='nofollow'>https://parse.ly/analytics</a>) is our flagship product, which measures first-party content engagement and audience attention on sites and apps. Just recently, we launched Parse.ly Currents (<a href='https://parse.ly/currents' rel='nofollow'>https://parse.ly/currents</a>), which showcases aggregate attention trends from over 1 billion monthly internet readers in a novel, privacy-safe way.</p><p>The mission of our lean distributed team is described here:</p><p><a href='https://blog.parse.ly/post/4736/mission/?utm_campaign=oct201..' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.parse.ly/post/4736/mission/?utm_campaign=oct201...</a>.</p><p>We happily skip commutes by working out of our ergonomic home offices. Here's a photograph of mine running two full-screen Parse.ly Analytics dashboards on my monitors:</p><p><a href='https://flic.kr/p/v1NZ73' rel='nofollow'>https://flic.kr/p/v1NZ73</a></p><p>As our first Growth &amp; Data Lead, you'll run a small team of designers and developers that owns the core experience of Parse.ly’s public website, technical documentation, knowledge base, emails/newsletters, data studies, and blog.</p><p>You'll have an opportunity to ship new features to any of these projects, with a goal of growing sign-ups (and customers) for these products. From a technical standpoint, you'll be able to use modern web development tools atop a simple and agile JavaScript and Python stack, and to work with designers/developers comfortable with that stack. But you'll also use analytics tools like Google Analytics, MixPanel and yes, even, Parse.ly itself, to understand engagement of our visitors, and to position us for more growth in new channels like organic search, social sharing, data-driven press, and free (self-service) data products.</p><p>If you're someone who loves data, growth, and marketing, and you want to take a B2B software company to the next level, this job is for you. To do this, you'll have designers and web developers as collaborators, and be able to leverage data-oriented growth marketing strategies, such as launching public products built with Parse.ly's data, or layering growth features into our existing products.</p><p>To be a fit for this role, you are the kind of person who’d enjoy the books &quot;Hacking Growth&quot;, &quot;Traction&quot;, and &quot;High Growth Handbook&quot;. If you are a former startup founder seeking to relocate to an established startup, but want to continue the path of deploying lean growth techniques, this role may be especially suited for you.</p><p>Apply at work@parsely.com with a couple paras describing why you're interested, a link to any portfolio/projects you think may be relevant, and/or your resume or LinkedIn profile. Make sure to mention HN and the &quot;Growth &amp; Data Lead&quot; role. Also, please list your timezone, working hours, and location. Note that though we can hire from most locations, we will prioritize those near US/Eastern timezone, due to the timezone makeup of this team.</p></span>",

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$100K (mid-level), $100K-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We contribute to an HRA to offset the cost of health insurance or healthcare expenses.</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

Accordingly, the reputation of Level 12 and the character of our employees is of utmost importance.

You use all resources at your disposal in an efficient manner to troubleshoot. You know when to ask someone for help and when more effort is needed on your part.</li><li><strong>Technical Prowess</strong>: you just “get” programming, computers, technology. The thought of solving a problem in an entirely new programming language, one you have never even heard of before, excites you.</li><li><strong>Technical Diversity</strong>: while we all have our preferences when it comes to programming languages or operating systems, you should be willing to work with anything, in any language, if that’s what it takes to get the job done. If you are easily lead into a “______ rocks, everything else sucks” mentality, this isn’t the job for you.</li><li><strong>Flexible</strong>: we are small, things change. You should be able to “roll with the punches.”</li><li><strong>Professional</strong>: at the end of the day, you like what you do, you take your job seriously, you do it extremely well, and you <strong>pay attention to the details</strong>!</li></ul><p><strong>Senior Developer<br></strong></p><p>The candidate for the Senior Developer position will usually have 6-10 years relevant experience and meet the following requirements:</p><ol><li>Technical Skills<ul><li>Are able to write modular, well-tested, and maintainable code</li><li>Know a software development domain really well and radiate that knowledge to our team and beyond</li><li>Are able to work on multiple projects as needed</li></ul></li><li>Leadership<ul><li>Leads the design for customer projects with feedback from other engineers</li><li>Proposes new ideas for improving the development team, customer projects, and/or our tech stack</li><li>Adheres to and promotes our <a href='https://level12.io/blog/development-mission-statement/' rel='nofollow'>development culture and mission</a></li><li>For Team Leads (see below): invests in other team members to see that they are growing as individuals and to facilitate productivity within our team.</li></ul></li><li>Code quality<ul><li>Leaves code in substantially better shape than before</li><li>Fixes bugs/regressions quickly</li><li>Monitors overall code quality/build failures</li><li>Creates tests religiously and makes sure the rest of the team is doing the same</li><li>Proactively identifies and reduces technical debt</li><li>Proactively defines and solves important architectural issues</li></ul></li><li>Communication<ul><li>Provides thorough and timely code feedback for peers</li><li>Able to communicate clearly on technical topics</li><li>Keeps issues up-to-date with progress</li><li>Helps guide other merge requests to completion</li><li>Helps with recruiting</li><li>Is able to manage conversations directly with customer contacts when needed.</li></ul></li><li>Performance &amp; Scalability<ul><li>Excellent at writing production-ready code with little assistance</li><li>Able to write complex code that can scale with a significant number of users</li><li>Avoids premature optimization</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Mid-Level Developers<br></strong></p><p>The candidate for the Mid-Level Developer position will usually have 3-6 years relevant experience and meet some but not all of the requirements listed above for senior developers.</p><p><strong>Leadership<br></strong></p><p>In addition to the leadership expectations noted above, some of our senior developers will also be involved in leading other developers and interacting with customers.
