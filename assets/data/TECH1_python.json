And we prefer working with remote engineers, but we’re also open to welcoming you into our Melbourne office.</p><p><strong>You will have flexibility to schedule your work around your other obligations but you will usually work at a fixed time. If your work hours don’t have much overlap with Australian business hours, you will need to be flexible with scheduling meetings late at night or early in the morning.</strong></p><p>Our service is very stable and we haven’t had any critical incidents that required urgent attention over the last year.</p><p><strong>About our culture</strong></p><p>We’re easy-going and easy to work with.

It is one of our two main products. Over the last year, we’ve been experiencing strong growth and we are now looking for an excellent generalist to join our team.\\nYou will be the technical lead for Draftable API and oversee much of web infrastructure. You will be working with our Product Lead and other team members to prioritize and build features. \\nYou will also be involved with developing our document comparison viewer, which is written in Javascript and used in all our products.\\nYou will spend at least 80% of your time thinking about how to implement things and writing code.\\n\\n# About you\\n* You have 5+ years of experience with Python (Django, Django REST Framework).\\n* You have 3+ years of experience with front-end development (Javascript, CSS, HTML).\\n* You have at least a year of experience with React.\\n* You are independent and self-reliant. You are happy working on a task by yourself but you will take initiative to involve other team members when necessary.\\n* You have a strong awareness of efficiency and computer science fundamentals (but you don’t need to know this stuff cold like a grad).\\n* You appreciate the importance of clear communication, especially in a remote role.\\n\\n# Work/life balance\\nWe understand you have a life outside work and we will respect your non-working and family time. We expect engineers to work a full-time load of 40 hours per week (and no more) and to be very productive during that time.\\nOur team is mostly remote (5 in Melbourne, 2 in Poland, and a few travelling the world). And we prefer working with remote engineers, but we’re also open to welcoming you into our Melbourne office. \\nYou will have flexibility to schedule your work around your other obligations but you will usually work at a fixed time. If your work hours don’t have much overlap with Australian business hours, you will need to be flexible with scheduling meetings late at night or early in the morning.\\nOur service is very stable and we haven’t had any critical incidents that required urgent attention over the last year.\\n\\n# About our culture\\nWe’re easy-going and easy to work with. We’re developer-led and have a flat structure. We are collaborative, and we expect you to take an active role in evolving our engineering culture. We like writing things down. We love Slack.\\nWe launch things as soon as they’re ready. We do things right the first time, even if it takes a little longer. We don’t have much technical debt. From time to time we promise a feature to customer, but we otherwise don’t have many external deadlines.\\n\\n# Some things you might be doing in your first few months\\n* Adding a new end-point to Draftable API\\n* Build an admin interface for internal staff\\n* Get our integration tests running inside docker\\n* Build a marketing sign-up page for our website that pipes form data through to Salesforce\\n* Work with our product lead to add a feature to our comparison viewer\\n\\n\\n# About our technical stack\\nWe have a fairly standard tech stack: Python (Django, Celery, SaltStack), React, PostgreSQL, Redis and RabbitMQ. Our frontend is JS, react, CSS, HTML.\\nOur core algorithms and products are written in .NET (mostly C# with some F# and some C++). In this role, it’s not intended that you will contribute to the core technology. \\n \\n\\n#Salary\\nUS$70000 to US$110000\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

see your&nbsp;kids school plays and games, you can run errands when there's no traffic and so on. &nbsp;So if you are someone who can manage flexibility and still get your stuff done then we are a

One of the main catalysts for this paradox is that the variety of data that represents a provider is not straight forward nor in one place. The time spent by patients combing through that information on their own can lead to added time in finding the right care.</p><p>On the KyruusOne team, we work hard to minimize mistakes when it comes to getting the data you need. This all starts with rich data sets of provider information that need to be canonicalized, normalized, and transformed into a warehouse that is accessible to all our applications. The team is a collaborative group of software engineers that tackle: provider data models, scalable APIs, intuitive workflows in the UI while tying together the different aspects of data management like bulk editing, canonicalization, and large datasets.</p><p>Join this team to work on the most central part of our applications. Be involved in cross-team discussions as we grow and scale our applications and help design the future of healthcare.</p><p>Here’s what that would mean for you in the Principal Software Engineer role on the Search Team.</p><p><strong><strong>Caring </strong></strong></p><p>You’ll design and write code (lots!) spanning several components to make progress toward assigned tasks on product roadmap and/or planned customer commitments.</p><p><strong><strong>Ownership</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Your typical day will include writing code (lots!) and reviewing others’ code.

You’ll drive your deliverables with a sense of urgency and ownership along with surfacing risks, mitigating them, and suggesting course corrections when appropriate.</li></ul><ul><li>You are comfortable taking on tasks with ambiguous business requirements and unclear technical strategy. You’ll use your technical expertise and mental resilience to identify bring order to chaos in terms of defining technical strategy and clarity of incremental execution.</li></ul><ul><li>You’ll provide technical mentorship to fellow engineers.</li></ul><ul><li>You’ll work with Engineering management and Product to get customer feedback to inform our architecture and technical designs that could span multiple functional systems.</li></ul><ul><li>You’ll report to the Manager, Engineering in the Routing &amp; Scheduling or in the PME &amp; PatientOne department within the R&amp;D - Engineering division.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Respect</strong></strong></p><p><strong>How You’ll Use Your Professional Skills</strong></p><p>You’ll use your 8+ years programming experience to:</p><ul><li>Help your Agile team develop pragmatic and scalable solutions to complex technical design problems and user workflows by building out Python/Flask based API’s, working with Elasticsearch to build performant queries to get the best possible match for patients.&nbsp; You will also leverage the AWS ecosystem to build serverless applications and use standard tooling like SAM, CodeDeploy, and Bitbucket Pipelines to automate the deployment.</li><li>Exceed the expectations and requirements of internal and external customers with high quality designs and code</li><li>Assess business value, tech debt, and tradeoffs during task prioritization.</li></ul><p>You’ll use your experience in/familiarity with technologies relevant to Kyruus to:</p><ul><li>Build, scale, and deliver dynamic and highly-available enterprise solutions</li><li>Think creatively about how to use technology and tools to solve problems faced by our users and customers</li><li>Evaluate and recommend new technologies relevant to add to our stack.</li></ul><p>You’ll use your communication and active listening skills to:</p><ul><li>Understand the needs of our users and customers at the beginning of each project</li><li>Provide complete, actionable, and timely technical feedback to your Agile team</li><li>Mentor fellow engineers</li><li>Create an inclusive environment where your peers feel motivated to succeed</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Empowerment</strong></strong></p><p><strong>How You’ll Know You’re Succeeding</strong></p><ul><li>You are a highly productive engineer committing a substantial amount of high-quality code reliably and on time to help the team achieve product roadmap goals and customer commits.</li><li>You regularly write excellent documentation.</li><li>You follow Agile practices in your daily and weekly work and are extremely dependable.</li><li>You mentor engineers on a wide range of technical areas that you’re a subject matter expert and share your knowledge on relevant topics with Kyruuvians by presenting at Lunch &amp; Learns, Technical Brown Bags, and internal demos.&nbsp;</li><li>When presented with challenging situations or unexpected obstacles to your team’s progress or that of cross-functional projects, you unblock these projects by developing creative solutions and mitigating technical risks.</li><li>You anticipate and develop strategies for future requirements and trends within your product area and/or dependent areas that share adjacencies with your team.</li></ul><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

We’ve been around since 1991, and we’re still going strong.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.</span></p><p><span>Since we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so.</span></p><p><span>We work remotely all over the United States and Canada. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won’t have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other.</span></p><p><span>Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.</span></p><p><span>Here’s an example of some projects we’ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:</span></p><ul><li><span>Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login</span></li><li><span>Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)</span></li><li><span>Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display</span></li></ul><p><strong>What we want from you: (aka: skills)</strong></p><p><span>We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience.&nbsp;</span></p><p>However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.</p><p><strong>Relationship Details:</strong></p><p><span>We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.</span></p><p><span>We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don’t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>It’s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren’t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project.&nbsp;</span></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/artandlogiccom/view/P_AAAAAAHAAD5CG4WieprX2o?trackingTag=stackOverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Art &amp; Logic, Inc.</h4>            <div><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://artandlogic.com/careers</a></li><li>Visit our Twitter @artandlogic</li></ul></ul>            </div>        ",

We are trying to find ways to describe groups of people mathematically. Some groups with well defined structures are easy, such as a company, government or an army. Others are hard: such as a village, academia or an online community interested in bitcoin. We are interested in the latter.</p>  <p>We believe this project can open the doors to solving the fundamental problems in decentralized systems design.</p>  <p><strong>These will be your tasks</strong></p>  <p>As a backend developer you’ll be responsible for managing things like scheduling background tasks, building API routes for our clients, and collecting and storing data from other APIs for use in our algorithms, all the while logging and fixing errors along the way. If you like working with MVC’s transforming and moving data in creative and efficient ways, this if for you.</p>  <p>We are also constantly finding new scaling challenges as we collect more data and users and need to readjust deployment on our servers. We need to manage communication between services, backups, testing, as well as resource management such as memory.</p>  <p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Intermediate Python</li>   <li>A history of using MVC’s like Django or Rails</li>   <li>Basic MySQL</li>   <li>Docker</li>   <li>Be the type of person who is language independent and enjoys using new tech</li>   <li>Git</li>   <li>Basic crontab</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>AWS</li>   <li>NGINX</li>   <li>Kubernetes</li>   <li>Github and its services</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>We’re offering these benefits</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Work on hard &amp; fundamental problems</li>   <li>Equity options</li>   <li>Work from home or office or a cafe (whatever you prefer!)</li>   <li>Work visa sponsorship to Germany (if you wish to relocate)</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>How we work</strong></p>  <p>We are mostly a distributed team of 5 and growing. Most of the team members are located in Europe.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Choose your location:</strong> It would be ideal for you to work with the team in Berlin and we are happy to sponsor a German Work Visa for you. If it is not possible for you to work from Berlin we can also offer that you work remotely.</li>   <li><strong>Regular off-sites:</strong> At least every quarter we make a point for the team to meet in person and work together for a couple of days. We typically rent a big house where we live and work for several days.</li>   <li><strong>Communication:</strong> We use the following tools at work: Slack for instant messaging Asana for task management Standup Alice (Slack bot) for weekly stand-ups 1:1 calls on per need basis</li>   <li><strong>Working time:</strong> We currently do not track your hours worked (eg. Mon-Fri 9-5) however we do expect you deliver results on tasks. We do expect that you will be available on Slack in the afternoon, Central European Time (GMT+1).</li>   <li><strong>Office:</strong> Most of us currently work remotely from home, cafés etc. and you are welcome to do the same. If you work with us in Berlin you can join us in our coworking space to get more of an “office culture”.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Culture of Critical Thinking</strong></p>  <p>One of the biggest risks we face is that we can fool ourselves into believing that we got something to work when we in fact did not. This is because verifying accuracy of our algorithm’s outputs takes a long time and significant infrastructure. This means that an experiment that was not well-thought through enough can lead us to wasting months of work. We cannot afford that. For this reason, it is essential that we build a culture around critical thinking and closely follow the scientific method.</p>  <p>If you are not familiar with Critical Thinking &amp; the Scientific Method, we encourage you to watch the following videos before having a chat with us:</p>  <p>Critical Thinking Course</p>  <p>Richard Feynman discussing the Scientific Method</p>  <p><strong>Big no-no’s</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Calls to authority (“I’ve been doing this for 20 years and you’re just an intern, we’ll do it my way”; “world’s top experts agree that…”)</li>   <li>Discrediting ideas based on their public perception (“If you think that you are a X, Y, Z”)</li>  </ul>  <p>Please include your GitHub account or some kind of portfolio of works within your CV/resume.</p> </div><a href='https://hive.join.com/jobs/292604-backend-developer?pid=98c1261599ca17c51388&amp;utm_source=berlinstartupjobs&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=singlepostingstandard&amp;utm_content=backenddeveloper' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this position</a>",

Home care is supported by some of the most powerful macro factors affecting the global economy: (1) the largest demographic shift in human history; (2) a shift in the $3 trillion dollar healthcare industry from fee-for-service to value-based care, which has expanded reimbursement for home care services; and (3) advancements in telehealth which enable the shift of healthcare from traditional clinical environments to the home.<br> <br><br> <br>Of the over 18 million seniors currently needing home care, 6 million receive care from family members and 1.5 million receive care through home care agencies. Our aging population drives the growth of the home care industry, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day. On top of this core growth, health insurers and other payers are increasingly reimbursing for home care, thus driving an increase in the percentage of seniors that can afford home care and driving an increase from the 1.5 million who receive home care today into the 18 million seniors that need home care in order to stay independent and age-in-place. Over 90% of seniors want to age-in-place: not only is it the most desired outcome, but it is also the most cost-effective.<br> <br><br> <br>Despite tremendous growth, the home care industry, along with the seniors and families it serves, faces numerous challenges. Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.<br> <br><br> <br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.<br> <br><br> <br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.<br> <br><br> <br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the \\&quot;virtual nervous system\\&quot; for the \\&quot;last mile\\&quot; of care for the world's<br> <br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.<br> <br><br> <br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.<br> <br><br> <br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.<br> <br><br> <br>**Top Reasons to Work with Us**<br> <br><br> <br>WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME<br> <br><br> <br>**What You Will Be Doing**<br> <br><br> <br>Build and design a scalable technology stack<br> <br>Approach challenges proactively<br> <br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions<br> <br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership<br> <br>Triage and fix bugs in code<br> <br>Effectively QA and test code<br> <br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)<br> <br><br> <br>**What You Need for this Position**<br> <br><br> <br>Entrepreneurial mindset required<br> <br>Prior experience building an application from scratch<br> <br>Prior Start-up Experience Required<br> <br>Extensive Python/Django experience<br> <br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)<br> <br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction<br> <br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem<br> <br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense<br> <br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus<br> <br>Machine Learning skills is a plus<br> <br><br> <br>- Python<br> <br>- Django<br> <br>- PostgreSQL<br> <br>- Redis<br> <br>- Celery<br> <br>- RabbitMQ<br> <br>- Angular.js<br> <br>- AWS<br> <br>- Startup Experience<br> <br>- JavaScript<br> <br><br> <br>**What's In It for You**<br> <br><br> <br>-Base Salary<br> <br>- Vacation/PTO<br> <br>- Medical<br> <br>- Dental<br> <br>- Vision<br> <br>- Bonus<br> <br>- 401k<br> <br>- Equity Share<br> <br><br> <br>So, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!<br> <br><br> <br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.<br> <br><br> <br><br><br> **CyberCoders, Inc is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer** <br><br><br> <br><br> <br><br><br>All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.<br><br><br> <br><br> <br><br><br> **Your Right to Work** - In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification document form upon hire.<br><br>*REMOTE CTO - Python, Django, PostgreSQL*<br>*CO-Denver*<br>*CD-1535069* <br> Associated topics: agile, c, chief technology officer, db2, information technology infrastructure library, j2ee, operating system, shell, software development, software manager</div>",

We currently do it in domains as diverse as education and specialised med-tech. Most of our projects start from scratch - an empty .js file or a whiteboard - and it is up to the creativity and technical talent of our team to come up with a great solution.</p><br /><p class=&quot;MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph&quot;>We believe in maximising the freedom of our team members. This means not only location independence and flexible hours, but also freedom to take ownership of projects, and to organise your work in a way that best supports your strengths. Besides freedom, we also believe in taking responsibility. All of us care deeply about building products that exceed the expectations of our clients and their users, and we are not afraid of working hard when it matters.</p><br /><p class=&quot;MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph&quot;>CodeLeap is not only a team of people with a passion for technology, we are proper geeks. As soon as we received our first client payment, we did the most reasonable thing we could think of: we got an Oculus. Outside of work, each of us enjoys being creative and curious - building software tools, DIY robots, playing musical instruments or weird video games.</p><br /><p class=&quot;MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph&quot;>If this sounds like the team you&rsquo;d like to join, reach out! We are a young, early stage business, and you could play a very meaningful role in shaping our future.

    "content": "<div>\n Minimum Required Skills:\n <br>Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ, Angular.js, AWS, Startup Experience, JavaScript\n <br>\n <br>If you are a CTO with experience, please read on!\n <br>\n <br>Home care is a rapidly growing $72 billion dollar industry in the United States serving over 1.5 million people. Home care is supported by some of the most powerful macro factors affecting the global economy: (1) the largest demographic shift in human history; (2) a shift in the $3 trillion dollar healthcare industry from fee-for-service to value-based care, which has expanded reimbursement for home care services; and (3) advancements in telehealth which enable the shift of healthcare from traditional clinical environments to the home.\n <br>\n <br>Of the over 18 million seniors currently needing home care, 6 million receive care from family members and 1.5 million receive care through home care agencies. Our aging population drives the growth of the home care industry, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day. On top of this core growth, health insurers and other payers are increasingly reimbursing for home care, thus driving an increase in the percentage of seniors that can afford home care and driving an increase from the 1.5 million who receive home care today into the 18 million seniors that need home care in order to stay independent and age-in-place. Over 90% of seniors want to age-in-place: not only is it the most desired outcome, but it is also the most cost-effective.\n <br>\n <br>Despite tremendous growth, the home care industry, along with the seniors and families it serves, faces numerous challenges. Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.\n <br>\n <br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.\n <br>\n <br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.\n <br>\n <br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the virtual nervous system for the last mile of care for the world's\n <br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.\n <br>\n <br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.\n <br>\n <br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.\n <br>\n <br>Top Reasons to Work with Us\n <br>\n <br>WORK REMOTELY\n <br>\n <br>What You Will Be Doing\n <br>\n <br>Build and design a scalable technology stack\n <br>Approach challenges proactively\n <br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions\n <br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership\n <br>Triage and fix bugs in code\n <br>Effectively QA and test code\n <br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)\n <br>\n <br>What You Need for this Position\n <br>\n <br>Entrepreneurial mindset required\n <br>Prior experience building an application from scratch\n <br>Prior Start-up Experience Required\n <br>Extensive Python/Django experience\n <br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)\n <br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction\n <br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem\n <br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense\n <br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus\n <br>Machine Learning skills is a plus\n <br>\n <br>- Python\n <br>- Django\n <br>- PostgreSQL\n <br>- Redis\n <br>- Celery\n <br>- RabbitMQ\n <br>- Angular.js\n <br>- AWS\n <br>- Startup Experience\n <br>- JavaScript\n <br>\n <br>What's In It for You\n <br>\n <br>-Base Salary \n <br>- Vacation/PTO\n <br>- Medical\n <br>- Dental\n <br>- Vision\n <br>- Bonus\n <br>- 401k\n <br>- Equity ShareSo, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!\n <br>\n <br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.\n <br>\n <br>Security Clearance will be needed - therefore, only US citizens can be considered.Please apply directly to by clicking 'Click Here to Apply' with your Word resume!\n <br>\n <br>Looking forward to receiving your resume and going over the position in more detail with you.\n <br>\n <br>- Not a fit for this position?

Home care is supported by some of the most powerful macro factors affecting the global economy: (1) the largest demographic shift in human history; (2) a shift in the $3 trillion dollar healthcare industry from fee-for-service to value-based care, which has expanded reimbursement for home care services; and (3) advancements in telehealth which enable the shift of healthcare from traditional clinical environments to the home.\n <br>\n <br>Of the over 18 million seniors currently needing home care, 6 million receive care from family members and 1.5 million receive care through home care agencies. Our aging population drives the growth of the home care industry, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day. On top of this core growth, health insurers and other payers are increasingly reimbursing for home care, thus driving an increase in the percentage of seniors that can afford home care and driving an increase from the 1.5 million who receive home care today into the 18 million seniors that need home care in order to stay independent and age-in-place. Over 90% of seniors want to age-in-place: not only is it the most desired outcome, but it is also the most cost-effective.\n <br>\n <br>Despite tremendous growth, the home care industry, along with the seniors and families it serves, faces numerous challenges. Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.\n <br>\n <br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.\n <br>\n <br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.\n <br>\n <br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the virtual nervous system for the last mile of care for the world's\n <br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.\n <br>\n <br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.\n <br>\n <br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.\n <br>\n <br>Top Reasons to Work with Us\n <br>\n <br>WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME\n <br>\n <br>What You Will Be Doing\n <br>\n <br>Build and design a scalable technology stack\n <br>Approach challenges proactively\n <br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions\n <br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership\n <br>Triage and fix bugs in code\n <br>Effectively QA and test code\n <br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)\n <br>\n <br>What You Need for this Position\n <br>\n <br>Entrepreneurial mindset required\n <br>Prior experience building an application from scratch\n <br>Prior Start-up Experience Required\n <br>Extensive Python/Django experience\n <br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)\n <br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction\n <br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem\n <br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense\n <br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus\n <br>Machine Learning skills is a plus\n <br>\n <br>- Python\n <br>- Django\n <br>- PostgreSQL\n <br>- Redis\n <br>- Celery\n <br>- RabbitMQ\n <br>- Angular.js\n <br>- AWS\n <br>- Startup Experience\n <br>- JavaScript\n <br>\n <br>What's In It for You\n <br>\n <br>-Base Salary \n <br>- Vacation/PTO\n <br>- Medical\n <br>- Dental\n <br>- Vision\n <br>- Bonus\n <br>- 401k\n <br>- Equity ShareSo, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!\n <br>\n <br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.\n <br>\n <br>Security Clearance will be needed - therefore, only US citizens can be considered.Please apply directly to by clicking 'Click Here to Apply' with your Word resume!\n <br>\n <br>Looking forward to receiving your resume and going over the position in more detail with you.\n <br>\n <br>- Not a fit for this position?

We conduct rigorous analyses of tax and economic proposals and provide data-driven recommendations on how to shape equitable and sustainable tax systems. ITEP’s expertise and data uniquely enhance federal, state, and local policy debates by revealing how taxes affect both public revenues and people of various levels of income and wealth as well as other demographic characteristics like race and ethnicity.</p>\n <p>We believe that taxes are the building blocks of a thriving economy and society, providing the resources for necessary investments in our communities. To move toward a vision where federal, state, and local tax systems raise enough revenue to fund common priorities and do so in a manner that promotes shared prosperity for all, we promote common sense tax policies that are responsive to our ever-changing economy and that raise revenue in an equitable and sustainable way.</p>\n <p>The technical engine behind our work is ITEP’s Microsimulation Tax Model. Developed in 1996, the model computes the revenue yield and incidence of federal, state and local taxes, including both current tax law and proposed tax law changes. The model is unique in its ability to produce analysis at the federal and state levels and to analyze income, consumption and property taxes.</p>\n <p>We seek a <strong>Senior Software Engineer (Full Stack) </strong>to join ITEP’s creative, passionate and productive staff team as our Lead Tax Model Platform Developer.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>As the Lead Tax Model Platform Developer, you will begin working with an existing Python code base and complete the migration of the model from a legacy platform to the new Python platform. Completion of this project will set up ITEP’s tax model in a sustainable web-based environment, preserving our current model’s functionality and generating sufficient flexibility for longer-term development of content and user-driven enhancements.</li>\n  <li>Beyond the platform migration, ongoing responsibilities include timely problem-solving to adapt the platform to respond to frequent tax policy proposals and changes, improving the efficiency of the platform to make users more productive, collaborating with our senior economist to integrate updated data, and developing a lengthy product roadmap (including external facing products that make our model accessible to state and national partners).</li>\n </ul>\n <p>This role reports directly to ITEP’s senior economist and works closely with the entire policy analyst team.</p>\n <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Lead front and backend technical development work as part of the reconfiguration of ITEP’s microsimulation tax model—currently based on legacy Visual Fox Pro (VFP) code—to a Python web app (built on the Django framework) to be deployed on an Azure platform.</li>\n  <li>Lead the technical development, integration and iterative improvement of ITEP’s tax modeling capacities.</li>\n  <li>Communicate clearly with multiple constituencies, soliciting and digesting feedback from both technical and non-technical users.</li>\n  <li>Ensure that all code development, data handling and version control are done efficiently, securely, transparently and in a manner that improves user productivity and timeliness.</li>\n  <li>Support documentation of ITEP’s model processes.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Contribute fundamentally to ITEP’s mission as a progressive tax policy organization. Interact with the software development communities, representing the high quality of engineering work at ITEP.</li>\n  <li>Opportunities to deepen your technical architecture skills or develop technical management skills based on your career aspirations.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Required Experience and Skills</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Three to five years of experience as a full stack software engineer.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Specific experience with:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>managing cloud deployments (e.g., Azure, AWS and/or Google Cloud);</li>\n  <li>managing Python web app development;</li>\n  <li>designing server-side and client-side architecture;</li>\n  <li>optimizing database function and management (ideally PostgreSQL);</li>\n  <li>using object-relational mapping (ORM).</li>\n  <li>Ability to manage two or more concurrent projects, working both independently as well as with a team.</li>\n  <li>Ability to effectively communicate with non-technical users, responding effectively to user needs.</li>\n  <li>Ability to write effective technical documentation.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>In addition, other helpful (though not necessary) experience would include having worked remotely on a software development team and having developed and deployed software for governments and/or nonprofit organizations.</p>\n <p><strong>Start date:</strong> Preferred start date is August 2019.</p>\n <p><strong>Location: Flexible. ITEP is located in Washington, DC, however we are open to hiring a remote staff member for this position.
