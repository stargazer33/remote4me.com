We're looking for people who are ambitious and deeply driven to make a difference. <br><br>Your ability as a general pragmatic developer and fast learner is what truly matters to us. As you read the specifics below, keep in mind that the skill we are looking for is more in the lines of &quot;awesome solver of challenges&quot; than any one specific skill. <br><br>You would work on JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS and other techs to create a great looking modern and responsive web driven UI. You would also be ready to dive into the Django and Python underpinnings and add the bits necessary for a great user experience. Underneath it all you'll find Postgres, Redis and a good heaping of Docker and Kubernetes.<br><br>While this ad is about the front-end, we're really into jacks-of-all trades. We think in a startup every team member needs to be nimble and flexible enough to do whatever it takes to deliver the product.<br><br>You can expect to work with a small full time team of crafty developers, in a quickly growing startup. We're a remote only shop so you'll never feel you're not in the loop due to not being in the main office -- there is no main office! You can learn more about how we work [here](https://www.screenly.io/blog/2016/11/23/how-we-work-at-screenly/).<br><br>You like:<br><br>* Detail oriented front-end work.<br>* Great UX.<br>* Occasionally fun UI and UX.<br>* Unit tests, integration tests, ui tests, test tests, every test.<br>* Python.<br><br>This is a full-time position. We only hire individuals, not agencies. Please state the square root of twenty five in your cover letter. You will need to attend a daily meeting and a fortnightly video planning meeting (around 16:00 UTC) so please don’t apply if that doesn’t work for you or you can’t work a semi-regular 5-day week. Hours are very flexible, but you do have to be around often enough for the rest of the team to interact with you.<p>See more jobs at <span>Screenly</span></p></div></div>",

We're looking for people who are ambitious and deeply driven to make a difference. <br /><br />Your ability as a general pragmatic developer and fast learner is what truly matters to us. As you read the specifics below, keep in mind that the skill we are looking for is more in the lines of &quot;awesome solver of challenges&quot; than any one specific skill. <br /><br />You would work on JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS and other techs to create a great looking modern and responsive web driven UI. You would also be ready to dive into the Django and Python underpinnings and add the bits necessary for a great user experience. Underneath it all you'll find Postgres, Redis and a good heaping of Docker.<br /><br />While this ad is about the front-end, we're really into jacks-of-all trades. We think in a startup every team member needs to be nimble and flexible enough to do whatever it takes to deliver the product.<br /><br />You can expect to work with a small full time team of crafty developers, in a quickly growing startup. We're a remote only shop so you'll never feel you're not in the loop due to not being in the main office -- there is no main office!<br /><br />You like:<br /><br />* Detail oriented front-end work.<br />* Great UX.<br />* Occasionally fun UI and UX.<br />* Unit tests, integration tests, ui tests, test tests, every test.<br />* Python.<br /><br />This is a full-time position. We only hire individuals, not agencies. Please state the square root of twenty five in your cover letter. You will need to attend a daily meeting and a fortnightly video planning meeting (around 16:00 UTC) so please don’t apply if that doesn’t work for you or you can’t work a semi-regular 5-day week. Hours are very flexible, but you do have to be around often enough for the rest of the team to interact with you.<br /><br />To be considered for the role, please provide the answer to the following two questions:<br /><br />* On http://gist.github.com, post a short snippet of code (less than 1 screen) that you're proud of and tell us what's great about it.<br />* What do you think about the new Python syntax which was just announced?",

As the hackathon ended, a few of us migrated into the hotel hallway to continue working, completing the prototype as the hotel started waking up for breakfast. Months of spare-time development followed, then funding. That was five years ago — we’ve got the same excitement for Impactstory today.</p><p>We’ve also got great momentum. The scientific journal <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05968-3' rel='nofollow'>Nature recently profiled our main product</a>: “Unpaywall has become indispensable to many academics, and tie-ins with established scientific search engines could broaden its reach.” We’re making solid revenue, and it’s time to expand our team.</p><p>We’re passionate about open science, and we run our non-profit company openly too. All of our code is open source, we make our data as open as possible, and we post our grant proposals so that everyone can see both our successful and our unsuccessful ones. We try to be the change we want to see </p>ABOUT THE POSITION<p>The position is lead dev for Unpaywall, our index of all the free-to-read scholarly papers in the world. Because Unpaywall is surfacing millions of formerly inaccessible open-access scientific papers, it’s growing very quickly, both in terms of usage and revenue. We think it’s a really transformative piece of infrastructure that will enable entire new classes of tools to improve science communication. As a nonprofit, that’s our aim.</p><p>We’re looking for someone to take the lead on the tech parts of <a href='https://unpaywall.org/' rel='nofollow'>Unpaywall</a>. <strong>You must have 5+ years of experience with both Python and SQL (we use PostgreSQL), and experience with directly maintaining and enhancing a production system.</strong> But more importantly, we’re looking for someone who is smart, dedicated, and gets things done! As an early team member you will play a key role in the company as we grow.</p><p>The position is remote, with flexible working hours, and plenty of vacation time. We are a small team so tell us what benefits are important to you and we’ll make them happen. We're a nonprofit, so no stock options.</p>OUR TEAM<p>We’re at about a million dollars of revenue (grants and earned income) with just two employees: the two co-founders. We value kindness, honesty, grit, and smarts. We’re taking our time on this hire, holding out for just the right person.</p><p></p>                      <h3>Desired Skills</h3>            <ul>                              <li><span>PostgreSQL</span></li>                          </ul>                                <h3>How to Apply</h3>            <p></p><p>Sound like you?

We started out as a software development consulting company way back in 2000, developing performance test and measurement software for customers such as Nasdaq and the European space agency. We wrote both hardcore, low-level networking software and high-level web user interfaces and became quite good at both of those things. We pride ourselves on understanding the lower levels of a networked application while at the same time realizing how incredibly important UX is. In 2009 we took the step and launched loadimpact.com, becoming a product company rather than a consulting company, and we have never looked back.</p><p>Recruiting is ongoing.

We are made of many small teams that are broadly distributed across the US, featuring tightly collaborative groups of developers, designers, and product managers constantly encouraging each other to deliver work that instills pride and fulfillment.</p><p>Our developers are organized into a network of small teams with embedded product managers, designers, and front-end specialists focused on specific functional areas. &nbsp;We believe deeply in automated testing, code review, and iterative improvement. We are in the midst of a transition from a monolithic web application to a microservices ecosystem, and welcome individuals who’ve made that journey before or are interested in starting it with us.</p><p>Our team is located in the United States. We happily support a variety of employees who connect remotely from the American South, the Pacific Northwest, New England, and the Midwest, as well as those who come into our offices in Boston or Sebastopol, CA but we cannot offer full time employment to those who live and operate outside of the United States.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>Our backend engineers are focused on building a diverse family of scalable and robust micro-services, aimed at a variety of educational audiences. &nbsp;Software engineers work in two week sprints, maintaining a balance between building new features and maintaining older ones. New features are designed in collaboration with product managers and other teammates. Engineers exchange code reviews with other team members, provide mentorship to junior engineers, and assist QA and Ops in troubleshooting product issues.</p><p>Our primary backend platform is based on Python and Django and is supported by PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Solr. We also utilize Ruby on Rails in some key applications. Many of our applications and services are dockerized and deployed into Kubernetes clusters by Jenkins. While your focus will be on backend work, sometimes you will be called upon to make changes to our front-end codebase, which is based on Javascript (ES6), React, and Redux.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>We are interested in people who have experience building and supporting web applications with a diverse and engaged user base. &nbsp;We desire candidates who work comfortably in an agile environment and with collaborators who are distributed across multiple time zones. &nbsp;We value colleagues who are helpful, respectful, humble, and always willing to do what’s best for our users. We desire developers who treat automated tests as essential, and believe that code reviews are a crucial path of learning and of sharing knowledge. The women and men of our platform team have taken many traditional and nontraditional paths to the developer profession, and we welcome diverse teams that are bound together by a mutual love of learning.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>2 years of experience developing web applications and services</li><li>Demonstrated competency with Python and Django</li><li>Experience building and maintaining RESTful APIs</li><li>Experience with automated testing and test-driven development</li><li>Experience with continuous integration tools and a rapid release cycle</li></ul><p><strong>Experience Bonuses</strong></p><ul><li>Django-REST-Framework</li><li>Celery</li><li>React and Redux</li><li>Docker</li><li>Kubernetes</li><li>Microservice architecture</li><li>RabbitMQ or similar messaging system</li><li>Node.js</li><li>Scrum</li><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Go</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://app.jobvite.com/j?cj=o97b8fwj&amp;s=Stack_Overflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About O'Reilly Media</h3>            <div><p><strong>Inspiring the future for more than 40 years</strong></p><p>We share the knowledge and teach the skills people need to change their world.

Whether you're working to advance your career, be a better manager, or achieve the next breakthrough in technology or business, learning new skills is at the heart of it all.</p><p>With a range of formats including live online training courses, interactive tutorials, books, videos, and case studies, we equip all members of the workforce with the insight they need to stay ahead in an ever-changing economy.</p><p>Learning should not be measured in terms of usage, course completion, or certifications.

We work all across the United States and Canada, just the way we have done since we started in 1991. Why would we work in an office when there are so many ways to collaborate and work together remotely?</p><p>Art+Logic is always seeking creative, bright, passionate programmers who are excited to take on new challenges. Currently, we’re looking for developers with&nbsp;mobile development&nbsp;experience, for possible, upcoming projects.</p><p>Our project teams usually consist of 1-5 developers plus UX/UI design and dedicated QA. Since we create custom software, our projects often involve different technologies and industries, so there is always something to new to learn. We like to keep things interesting!</p><p>This is a contracting position (1099), though we are looking for long term working relationships.

And then I remember: it’s the projects I work on. Nowhere else have I found such a variety of interesting and challenging assignments, and opportunities to grow as a developer. And it’s for a reason. People don’t approach Art+Logic to churn out routine apps; they come because they have something hard, often requiring research and skilled implementation.&nbsp;There is no better place than Art+Logic for software developers to do what they love — and also better hone their craft.</em>”</p><p><br>Job Type: 1099, rates ranging $35-$50/hour<br>Travel: None Required - Work from Home<br>Location: United States and Canada only</p><p><strong>Find out more at:</strong></p><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://plus.google.coj/+ArtAndLogic' rel='nofollow'>https://plus.google.com/+ArtAndLogic</a></li><li><a href='http://www.artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>http://www.artandlogic.com/careers/</a></li></ul></ul><p><strong>Have more questions?</strong>&nbsp;Email us at <a href='mailto:Recruiting@artandlogic.com' rel='nofollow'>Recruiting@artandlogic.com</a></p><p>Some things are best said multiple times. <strong>Please note&nbsp;your interest in this specific position, when applying.&nbsp;</strong>(You can do so&nbsp;in the &quot;Brag&quot; section.)</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual Conference</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$100K (mid-level), $100K-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We contribute to an HRA to offset the cost of health insurance or healthcare expenses.</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights. The full job description for both positions are on our website and includes salary information, videos, and instructions on applying: <a href='https://level12.io/careers/' rel='nofollow'>https://level12.io/careers/</a></p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Character First</strong></p><p>Level 12 is <a href='https://www.level12.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>founded on biblical principles</a> and has biblically informed goals. Accordingly, the reputation of Level 12 and the character of our employees is of utmost importance. You <strong>do not</strong> need to share our leadership's religious convictions, but you will need to share our commitment to the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: honest, trustworthy, reliable, ethical. We have high moral standards and we expect our employees to share those standards. If you use pirated software or media, don’t mind “tweaking” the truth, or think `porn == entertainment`, this is not the job for you!</li><li><strong>Good work ethic</strong>: you work hard and like to work hard. You also work efficiently, seeking to make the best use of your time.</li><li><strong>Dedicated</strong>: you really desire to contribute to and improve our company; you are not just earning a paycheck. You demonstrate a high level of “ownership” for and initiative with projects that are assigned to you.</li><li><strong>Teachable</strong>: you have a willingness and desire for feedback/correction. You are always looking to improve. You are willing to ask for help even if it makes you “look bad.”</li><li><strong>Resourceful</strong>: you know how to solve problems or are at least able to explain that the problem is not solvable with the requirements given. You use all resources at your disposal in an efficient manner to troubleshoot. You know when to ask someone for help and when more effort is needed on your part.</li><li><strong>Technical Prowess</strong>: you just “get” programming, computers, technology.

Being a pretty small remote team of senior engineers from different countries, we develop the world's first self-evolving, adaptive learning platform that’s used for premium online courses (<a href='https://www.bloombergprep.com/' target=&quot;_blank&quot;>CFA</a>, <a href='https://learn.gmat.economist.com' target=&quot;_blank&quot;>GMAT</a>, <a href='https://gre.economist.com' target=&quot;_blank&quot;>GRE</a>, and others) in partnership with companies such as Bloomberg and The&nbsp;Economist. These courses help people (regardless of location and socioeconomic class) to get better jobs, be more successful, and make their dreams come true.</p><p><br></p><p>We have a brilliant team of professors who create unique first-class content, and we’re on the way to disrupt the global education market. Within our platform, students are constantly engaged in a personalized dialogue with our AI private tutor, far surpassing the efficacy of existing resources (textbooks, video or classroom lectures, and various e-learning products).</p><p><br></p><p>We offer a full-time contract for a 100% remote senior backend position, so you can work from wherever you wish. At the same time, you are also invited to participate in periodic payable team meetups in different countries together with our CEO. Hiking in Armenia and skiing in Sochi? Sure. Bicycles and amazing sweets in Turkey, yachting in Cyprus, and cool beer in Prague? Why not! Something new every time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Our culture</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Let’s be honest: we are lucky here because we have minimum bureaucracy and enough freedom. We truly enjoy a large amount of autonomy and independence in our day-to-day tasks, and sometimes we work hard (who’s not familiar with healthy deadlines?). But we are also happy with what we do and what we get. As a consequence of that, we need talented someone who can approach the backend from different angles and who is comfortable asking questions and proposing valuable solutions to help us move forward.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes we switch and add new technologies according to our needs, but nobody suffers. Some of our projects are stand-alone ones, others have a neat architecture and are related to each other. That makes their development even more interesting and challenging. We also follow style guides and process, and you’re welcome to improve them both.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>We’d like to hear from a candidate who:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><ul><li>Has experience at least 3 years of professional software development of building and scaling sophisticated high-performance systems.</li><li>Has understanding of common programming patterns and principles.</li><li>Has advanced experience of development with Python.</li><li>Has a solid knowledge of MongoDB.</li><li>Has experience writing unit and integration tests.</li><li>Has experience of using Git (we use Github).</li><li>Confident in communicating in English, verbal and written.

    "content": "<h2>ABOUT US</h2><p><strong>We’re building tools to bring about an open science revolution.</strong></p><p>Impactstory began life as a hackathon project. As the hackathon ended, a few of us migrated into the hotel hallway to continue working, completing the prototype as the hotel started waking up for breakfast. Months of spare-time development followed, then funding. That was five years ago — we’ve got the same excitement for Impactstory today.</p><p>We’ve also got great momentum.  The scientific journal <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05968-3' rel='nofollow'>Nature recently profiled Unpaywall, our main product</a>:  “Unpaywall has become indispensable to many academics, and tie-ins with established scientific search engines could broaden its reach.”  We’re making solid revenue, and it’s time to expand our team.</p><p>We’re passionate about open science, and we run our non-profit company openly too.  All of our code is open source, we make our data as open as possible, and we post our grant proposals so that everyone can see both our successful and our unsuccessful ones.  We try to be the change we want to see </p><h2>ABOUT THE POSITION</h2><p>The position is lead dev for Unpaywall, our index of all the free-to-read scholarly papers in the world. Because Unpaywall is surfacing millions of formerly inaccessible open-access scientific papers, it’s growing very quickly, both in terms of usage and revenue. We think it’s a really transformative piece of infrastructure that will enable entire new classes of tools to improve science communication. As a nonprofit, that’s our aim.</p><p>We’re looking for someone to take the lead on the tech parts of <a href='https://unpaywall.org/' rel='nofollow'>Unpaywall</a>.  <strong>You must have 5+ years of experience with both Python and SQL (we use PostgreSQL), and experience with directly maintaining and enhancing a production system.</strong>  But more importantly, we’re looking for someone who is smart, dedicated, and gets things done! As an early team member you will play a key role in the company as we grow.</p><p>The position is remote, with flexible working hours, and plenty of vacation time.  We are a small team so tell us what benefits are important to you and we’ll make them happen.  We're a nonprofit, so no stock options.</p><h2>OUR TEAM</h2><p>We’re at about a million dollars of revenue (grants and earned income) with just two employees: the two co-founders.  We value kindness, honesty, grit, and smarts. We’re taking our time on this hire, holding out for just the right person.</p><h2>HOW TO APPLY</h2><p>Sound like you?  Email to <a href='mailto:team@impactstory.org' rel='nofollow'>team@impactstory.org</a> with (1) what appeals to you about this specific job (this part is important to us), (2) a brief summary of your experience with directly maintaining and enhancing a production system (3) a copy of your resume or inkedin profile and (4) a link to your github profile.  Thanks!</p><p>No agencies or consultancies please!</p>",

We’re always building and shipping, but with an appreciation for the theoretical. We work closely with our users, technology partners, and engage with the global decentralization community on and offline.</p>  <p>From our very beginnings having a female cofounder: we are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We strongly encourage applications from women, transgender or non-binary people, people of color, people with disabilities, or anyone traditionally underrepresented in tech.</p>  <p><em>Location:</em> We’re in Berlin, Germany. If you don’t know much about Berlin, don’t fret. Almost all of us have immigrated here, from all over the world, from Canada to India, from Italy to USA. And we love it!</p>  <p><em>Office time:</em> We trust you to do your job, and doing your job is about getting the task done, not us looking over your shoulder. In general we try to be around the office here in Berlin but as with our technology, our team is often distributed and our processes are optimized so work can get done in a mix of on-site and remote work. If you feel you’re most effective working from a top of a mountain, please do.</p>  <p><em>Choice of tech:</em> We provide you with either a top-notch Dell or MacBook Pro laptop, and with everything else you need and chose to get your work done.</p>  <p><em>Immigration:</em> We’ll hold your hand in the visa / immigration process, which is smooth and surprisingly fast.</p>  <p><em>Language:</em> We speak English in the office. And in fact if you only speak English, you can easily get by in Berlin. (As is the case for many of our employees.)</p>  <p><em>Transit:</em> We’re spoiled, Berlin has one of the best public transit systems in the world. Our office is near a connection point of the underground (U-bahn) and trams. Berlin also has safe bike lines all throughout the city; you can park your bike in the office. We offer to reimburse half of you annual public transport ticket.</p>  <p><em>Time off:</em> Health first. Without health and happiness, what is left? So, our minimum paid leave per year is 25 days, plus statutory national holidays.</p>  <p><em>Health Benefits:</em> Germany has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. Some of the nation’s top university hospitals are here in Berlin. Many of us have a family doctor just down the street from our office. Berlin is also great for sports.</p>  <p><em>Parenting, Parental Leave:</em> We love kids! And we recognize the time that parents need for their children’s’ well-being, not to mention their own well-being! So we want to give all the space in the world to new parents who wish to spend time with their children: mothers get fully paid maternity leave six weeks prior to birth and eight weeks after. In addition, there are 14 months of 2/3 paid leave, split between the parents according to the parents’ choice. And for general parental responsibilities that invariably come up, by all means, go attend to your child. We trust that you are a professional and know how to balance your time.</p>  <p><em>Professional and Personal Growth:</em> Ocean Protocol is at the epicenter of blockchains + big data + AI, so if you’re not learning, then something’s wrong! We’ll be giving you opportunities to represent us speaking at conferences, hosting hackathons, writing, and more. Finally, we give you an annual self-development budget that you choose as you wish to spend on books, personal conferences, and other things to grow yourself.</p>  <p><strong>Your next step?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Are you up for working in an awesome team, learning a ton, and bringing blockchain to the masses?
