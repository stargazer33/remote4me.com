Home care is supported by some of the most powerful macro factors affecting the global economy: (1) the largest demographic shift in human history; (2) a shift in the $3 trillion dollar healthcare industry from fee-for-service to value-based care, which has expanded reimbursement for home care services; and (3) advancements in telehealth which enable the shift of healthcare from traditional clinical environments to the home.<br><br>Of the over 18 million seniors currently needing home care, 6 million receive care from family members and 1.5 million receive care through home care agencies. Our aging population drives the growth of the home care industry, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day. On top of this core growth, health insurers and other payers are increasingly reimbursing for home care, thus driving an increase in the percentage of seniors that can afford home care and driving an increase from the 1.5 million who receive home care today into the 18 million seniors that need home care in order to stay independent and age-in-place. Over 90% of seniors want to age-in-place: not only is it the most desired outcome, but it is also the most cost-effective.<br><br>Despite tremendous growth, the home care industry, along with the seniors and families it serves, faces numerous challenges. Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.<br><br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.<br><br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.<br><br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the virtual nervous system for the last mile of care for the world's<br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.<br><br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.<br><br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.<br><br>Top Reasons to Work with Us<br><br>WORK REMOTELY<br><br>What You Will Be Doing<br><br>Build and design a scalable technology stack<br>Approach challenges proactively<br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions<br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership<br>Triage and fix bugs in code<br>Effectively QA and test code<br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)<br><br>What You Need for this Position<br><br>Entrepreneurial mindset required<br>Prior experience building an application from scratch<br>Prior Start-up Experience Required<br>Extensive Python/Django experience<br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)<br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction<br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem<br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense<br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus<br>Machine Learning skills is a plus<br><br>- Python<br>- Django<br>- PostgreSQL<br>- Redis<br>- Celery<br>- RabbitMQ<br>- Angular.js<br>- AWS<br>- Startup Experience<br>- JavaScript<br><br>What's In It for You<br><br>-Base Salary <br>- Vacation/PTO<br>- Medical<br>- Dental<br>- Vision<br>- Bonus<br>- 401k<br>- Equity ShareSo, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!<br><br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.<br><br>Security Clearance will be needed - therefore, only US citizens can be considered.Please apply directly to by clicking 'Click Here to Apply' with your Word resume!<br><br>Looking forward to receiving your resume and going over the position in more detail with you.<br><br>- Not a fit for this position?

Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.<br><br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.<br><br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.<br><br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the virtual nervous system for the last mile of care for the world's<br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.<br><br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.<br><br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.<br><br>Top Reasons to Work with Us<br><br>WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME<br><br>What You Will Be Doing<br><br>Build and design a scalable technology stack<br>Approach challenges proactively<br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions<br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership<br>Triage and fix bugs in code<br>Effectively QA and test code<br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)<br><br>What You Need for this Position<br><br>Entrepreneurial mindset required<br>Prior experience building an application from scratch<br>Prior Start-up Experience Required<br>Extensive Python/Django experience<br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)<br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction<br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem<br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense<br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus<br>Machine Learning skills is a plus<br><br>- Python<br>- Django<br>- PostgreSQL<br>- Redis<br>- Celery<br>- RabbitMQ<br>- Angular.js<br>- AWS<br>- Startup Experience<br>- JavaScript<br><br>What's In It for You<br><br>-Base Salary <br>- Vacation/PTO<br>- Medical<br>- Dental<br>- Vision<br>- Bonus<br>- 401k<br>- Equity ShareSo, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!<br><br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.<br><br>Security Clearance will be needed - therefore, only US citizens can be considered.Please apply directly to by clicking 'Click Here to Apply' with your Word resume!<br><br>Looking forward to receiving your resume and going over the position in more detail with you.<br><br>- Not a fit for this position?

We conduct rigorous analyses of tax and economic proposals and provide data-driven recommendations on how to shape equitable and sustainable tax systems. ITEP’s expertise and data uniquely enhance federal, state, and local policy debates by revealing how taxes affect both public revenues and people of various levels of income and wealth as well as other demographic characteristics like race and ethnicity.</p><p>We believe that taxes are the building blocks of a thriving economy and society, providing the resources for necessary investments in our communities. To move toward a vision where federal, state, and local tax systems raise enough revenue to fund common priorities and do so in a manner that promotes shared prosperity for all, we promote common sense tax policies that are responsive to our ever-changing economy and that raise revenue in an equitable and sustainable way.</p><p>The technical engine behind our work is ITEP’s Microsimulation Tax Model. Developed in 1996, the model computes the revenue yield and incidence of federal, state and local taxes, including both current tax law and proposed tax law changes. The model is unique in its ability to produce analysis at the federal and state levels and to analyze income, consumption and property taxes.</p><p>We seek a <strong>Senior Software Engineer (Full Stack) </strong>to join ITEP’s creative, passionate and productive staff team as our Lead Tax Model Platform Developer.</p><ul><li>As the Lead Tax Model Platform Developer, you will begin working with an existing Python code base and complete the migration of the model from a legacy platform to the new Python platform. Completion of this project will set up ITEP’s tax model in a sustainable web-based environment, preserving our current model’s functionality and generating sufficient flexibility for longer-term development of content and user-driven enhancements.</li><li>Beyond the platform migration, ongoing responsibilities include timely problem-solving to adapt the platform to respond to frequent tax policy proposals and changes, improving the efficiency of the platform to make users more productive, collaborating with our senior economist to integrate updated data, and developing a lengthy product roadmap (including external facing products that make our model accessible to state and national partners).</li></ul><p>This role reports directly to ITEP’s senior economist and works closely with the entire policy analyst team.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Lead front and backend technical development work as part of the reconfiguration of ITEP’s microsimulation tax model—currently based on legacy Visual Fox Pro (VFP) code—to a Python web app (built on the Django framework) to be deployed on an Azure platform.</li><li>Lead the technical development, integration and iterative improvement of ITEP’s tax modeling capacities.</li><li>Communicate clearly with multiple constituencies, soliciting and digesting feedback from both technical and non-technical users.</li><li>Ensure that all code development, data handling and version control are done efficiently, securely, transparently and in a manner that improves user productivity and timeliness.</li><li>Support documentation of ITEP’s model processes.</li></ul><p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p><ul><li>Contribute fundamentally to ITEP’s mission as a progressive tax policy organization. Interact with the software development communities, representing the high quality of engineering work at ITEP.</li><li>Opportunities to deepen your technical architecture skills or develop technical management skills based on your career aspirations.</li></ul><p><strong>Required Experience and Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Three to five years of experience as a full stack software engineer.</li></ul><p><strong>Specific experience with:</strong></p><ul><li>managing cloud deployments (e.g., Azure, AWS and/or Google Cloud);</li><li>managing Python web app development;</li><li>designing server-side and client-side architecture;</li><li>optimizing database function and management (ideally PostgreSQL);</li><li>using object-relational mapping (ORM).</li><li>Ability to manage two or more concurrent projects, working both independently as well as with a team.</li><li>Ability to effectively communicate with non-technical users, responding effectively to user needs.</li><li>Ability to write effective technical documentation.</li></ul><p>In addition, other helpful (though not necessary) experience would include having worked remotely on a software development team and having developed and deployed software for governments and/or nonprofit organizations.</p><p><strong>Start date:</strong> Preferred start date is August 2019.</p><p><strong>Location: Flexible.

What unites us in an intense desire to create the best products, data and tools to help people move around complex cities. We breathe, eat, sleep, and dream mobility and cities from the algorithms to the data to the tools that make the data.

There are features to ship, hard problems to solve, and scaling challenges to meet. The fruit is hanging low for smart, motivated people.<br /><br />In addition to the app we solve interesting problems with our paid product Citymapper Pass, a new subscription pass for London integrated with the app experience<br /><br />We're currently hiring across many teams and experience levels. If you believe in what Citymapper is doing — if you're ready to build tech to tackle mobility problems in urban areas  at an interesting scale — give us a shout.<br /><br />We have roles in the following areas:<br /><br />- Backend & internal APIs<br />- Routing systems and algorithms<br />- Pass Fintech stack (mastercard network)<br />- Full-stack web engineers<br />- Site reliability / Operations<br />- Security<br />- Data pipelines<br /><br />Experienced engineers should feel free to apply here as well and indicate any interest in more senior or managerial roles.",

Our first product streamlines recruiting scheduling and coordination, saving teams hundreds of hours a month. We’re just getting started on, and have our sights set on making hiring a great experience for recruiters, hiring managers, and candidates. We’re building the platform to engage these key stakeholders and fix the $200 billion per year hiring industry.   <br>   <br>This is an exceptional opportunity to join a small and fast-growing startup, transforming an industry with powerful and easy to use products customers love. As an early employee you'll have tons of ownership, a big impact on product, a say in our values, and opportunities to tremendously accelerate your career growth.   <br>   <br>We're building a remote team and looking for the best individuals - no matter where you are. All we require is a reliable internet connection and passion for building an amazing company.   <br>   <br>**What We’re Looking For**   <br>   <br>Generalist is too specific a term for you. Back end, front end, database design, infra - you've done it all. Building products end to end is where you shine - you don't like being constrained by titles. You can code the full stack and have built products end to end. You’re comfortable building web apps. If you don't know something, you learn what's needed to get the job done. You want to build something people want. You're product minded and have user empathy.   <br>   <br>We use JavaScript (React), Python (Flask), and SQL (PostgreSQL). We’re hosted on AWS. Having these skills is great, but we know the best engineers can pick them up quickly when needed.   <br>   <br>**What We Value**   <br>   <br>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, challenging the status quo, nothing is “not my job”, having empathy, being direct, and being honest.   <br>   <br>As engineers we believe in picking the right tool for the job, balancing technical excellence with pragmatism, having strong opinions weakly held, and attacking ideas not people.   <br>   <br>**What We Offer**   <br>   <br>* Autonomy, impact, and ownership. As an early employee you’ll shape the product direction and company values.   <br>* Competitive salary and significant equity in a fast growing, early stage startup.   <br>* Remote employment - work where you want, when you want.   <br>* Generous vacation policy - take time whenever you need to recharge. Building a lasting company is a marathon, not a sprint.   <br>* Top-notch healthcare, dental, and vision coverage.   <br>* Life and disability insurance.   <br>* Annual company retreat - helps build camaraderie as a remote team.   <br>* Computer and home office setup - we'll buy anything you need to do your best work.   <br>* Continuing education allowance - learn what you want, when you want.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- USA   <br>  </div> </div>",

The common thread in all that variety is that our projects relate to MVC frameworks.</p><p><strong>Your income</strong></p><p>This is a full time position paid on an hourly basis ($30 per hour for 7+ years of experience, $25 per hour for less). Said in another way, you have more control over your income.</p><p>Earning money based on hourly pay means that you earn money in the exact same way that the company does: billing for time. Paying a salary would put competing incentives between the developer and the company. Instead, we tie your incentives directly in line with the company. So long as you work within our 25-35 hours per week guidelines, your income is 100% tied to how much you work.</p><p>Do you do an amazing job meeting customer expectations with a minimal number of bugs? That's called job security. Customers always have their favorite developers. Make a name for yourself with quality work.</p><p>Engineer ROI also believes that connecting income to time worked maximizes team quality. The kind of people that want to collect a salary and drag the team down are not attracted to the company. That means you will work with talented colleagues that are motivated to make you, the code and the entire team better.</p><p><strong>Quality of Life</strong> - Your work week totals 25-35 hours with 30 being the ideal amount. You can work at any time of day so long as your work hours are consistent and evenly spaced across 4-6 days per week. One of our teammates works from 11 pm - 5 am in his local time zone because that's when he wants to work. The company cares more about you working when you're at your peak mental state rather than the time of day when you work.</p><p>Meetings are strictly limited to when they are necessary. Because your income is based on your time worked (which includes meetings), the company is incentivized to value and protect your work time.</p><p><strong>An Engineer's Environment</strong> - Test driven development comes first. We do not build features until existing code passes all tests. You are assigned tasks with the repository, at which point you are expected to own the problem and fix it. Because we operate in a &quot;no micromanaging&quot; environment, we need a team player that sincerely cares about the impact his/her engineering decisions will have across the project.</p><p>Version control is paramount. Commits to a project are not meant to be a fancy save button. Commits tell the team, &quot;I have tested this feature and it's production ready.&quot;</p><p>The team practices phased releases to minimize the risk of breaking production. Development turns into a commit, which is then passed to staging. Only if staging passes and operates normally do we merge a commit merge from staging to master and release it into production.</p><p>Nobody wants to get yanked out of bed to fix fires (we should not be like IT people on call!). Slow and steady keeps us looking sharp and polished to clients and keeps emergencies to a minimum. It's better for us and it's better for our customers' businesses.</p><p><strong>Small Teams</strong> - The size of the company is 4 total. Your work is meaningful, appreciated and because of the small team size, you have the ability to significantly influence the architecture and frameworks used within a project.</p><p><strong>Technologies</strong></p><p>Django 2.0 and related apps:</p><ul><li>Django REST Framework</li><li>Celery, RabbitMQ</li></ul><p>Laravel and PHP</p><p>HTML5</p><p>Javascript:</p><ul><li>VUE</li><li>Bootstrap</li><li>React</li><li>Node</li><li>JQuery</li></ul><p>Docker, Git</p><p>PostgreSQL</p><p><strong>Must haves</strong></p><p>You must have 2+ years of direct experience with Django. Django is our MVC of choice and the technology that all developers in the organization share in common. In order to be considered for our senior level pay rate of $30/hr, you need to make your case for why you deserve to be a senior level developer.</p><p>Most Django developers also work in the frontend using Javascript and HTML5. Given the choice between an expert in Django and an expert in Javascript, we would choose Django. That said, our teammates need to come on board with a strong foundation in Javascript.</p><p>2+ years of experience using Git for version control.</p><p><strong>Nice to haves</strong></p><p>webpack, Docker, expertise across multiple Javascript libraries, years of experience working with multiple types of databases (especially PostgreSQL). Laravel and PHP are nice to make keep the team as a wide-ranging MVC shop.</p><p><strong>Day to Day</strong></p><p>We intentionally avoid chatter apps like Slack or Skype. Most questions do not require an immediate reply, making threads within the repository's issue tracker our preferred method of communication. The biggest challenge for any developer is to minimize interruptions to help you spend most of your workday in the zone. Keeping chatter restricted to the issue tracking system keeps conversations organized and minimizes distractions. Genuine emergencies are handled over phone calls or What's App.</p><p>About 80%+ of your time is spent architecting or writing code. The remaining time is spent on team communication - reviewing proposed solutions from teammates, clarification on requirements, etc.</p><p>The types of projects and problems you encounter are everything related to MVC frameworks. Identify business problems, abstract them into models and serve the content through a browser.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/201688?reset=False&amp;ra=15DFM45OD8U8&amp;oqs=a%3D15DFM45OD8U8' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Engineer ROI</h3>            <div><p>If forced to choose between technical expertise and teamwork, we choose teamwork every time. Our projects are too large for a single developer to manage on their own. Instead, the project manager distributes tasks in a way that leads to individuals owning large sections of code.</p><p>Because the team is 100% remote and the hours are flexible, everyone places a heavy emphasis on the following:</p><p>- Test driven development. Our code is a reflection of ourselves and our work ethic. Every member of the team needs to see prove to his colleagues that committed code is production ready.</p><p>- Incremental change. Major changes have a way of turning into major problems. Commits are best broken down into bite-sized steps to minimize the introduction of bugs.</p><p>- Proactive ownership over the code base. If you see a problem, create a new issue to ensure that the team addresses problems before clients even know that they exist. Team members are expected to not only find problems, but to feel motivated to fix them without direction.</p><p>Our current projects are for a network of hormone replacement therapy clinics across the United States and a forex managed account program. Both sites have been built from the ground up, ensuring that we have maximum knowledge and expertise across the entire stack.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Remote</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Set Your Own Hours</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Our first product streamlines recruiting scheduling and coordination, saving teams hundreds of hours a month.

All we require is a reliable internet connection and passion for building an amazing company.</p><p></p><strong>What We’re Looking For</strong><p>Building products isn’t just about engineering – it’s about solving real world problems. What you build is more important to you than the technical challenge. You’re product minded and have user empathy. You’re an engineer at heart, but have explored product management or design in the past. You understand the importance of elegant design and powerful UI / UX. You want to build something people want.</p><p>You can code the full stack and have built web apps end to end. Front end is where you shine, but you’re not afraid to dive into backends when needed. You can whip up UIs in no time. You have an intuition for elegant designs, but recognize there’s no replacement for user testing. If you don’t know something, you learn what’s needed to get the job done.</p><p>We use JavaScript (React), Python (Flask), and SQL (PostgreSQL). We’re hosted on AWS. Having these skills is great, but we know the best engineers can pick them up quickly when needed.</p><p></p><strong>What We Value</strong><p>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, challenging the status quo, nothing is “not my job”, having empathy, being direct, and being honest.</p><p>As engineers we believe in picking the right tool for the job, balancing technical excellence with pragmatism, having strong opinions weakly held, and attacking ideas not people.</p><p></p><strong>What We Offer</strong><ul></ul><li>Autonomy, impact, and ownership.
