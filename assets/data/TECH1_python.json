With Sitka, patients receive personalized video reviews of their medical data from experts. Our platform allows patients and their doctors to consult with specialists easily and quickly, usually with turnarounds of hours instead of weeks.</p><p>We believe meaningful improvement in medicine requires new systems enabling convenient, conversational workflows between patients and their physicians, not tedious and documentation-heavy processes. As such, we integrate our platform deeply into complicated health systems so that providers can leverage our specialists easily and make better clinical decisions over video.</p><p>As a small, fully-remote startup, there are no big-company cog-in-the-machine roles. Everything and everyone matters, so we hire with that in mind. We value diversity, not just because building services for diverse populations requires a diverse team, but because we personally feel it’s the right thing to do.</p><h3><strong>About the job</strong></h3><p>Sitka engineers progressively bring order to the chaos of medicine. We work closely with our clinical practitioners and patients, rapidly iterating on the product and workflow to solve real problems in real clinics.</p><p>The platform we build serves patient, primary care, and specialist workflows in friendly-yet-compliant ways while providing robust tools around synchronous and asynchronous video and annotation. Sitka is a modern API-based web application — we use React to build our user-facing front-end, Python for our back-end web services, and we deploy containerized services to AWS.</p><p>You’d report to the CTO on a fully-remote team with tremendous flexibility to define the shape of the product, technical architecture and company itself. As an early engineer, you will be a critical member of the team, with your work directly affecting the success or failure of the company. The scope of your potential impact is limited only by your ambition and ability to get things done.</p></div></div><div><h3><strong>Requirements</strong></h3><div><ul><li>You are a seasoned software engineer that enjoys writing Python, and have at least 3 years of experience doing so.</li><li>You’ve designed and implemented complicated data architectures for a real-world service in either RDBMS or NoSQL storage systems (or both for extra points).</li><li>You understand modern web architecture – how the pieces fit together, how to build robust and reliable services, how to manage complexity as a service grows.</li><li>You like learning new things, teaching what you know to others and generally aren’t a jerk about it.</li><li>You’re capable of solving whole problems with lots of ambiguity. We’re a startup doing things that nobody has done before. This means building things with imperfect information and building for adaptation when your assumptions are wrong. It’s not for everyone.</li><li>You care about building an engineering culture based on diversity, respect, recognition and trust.</li></ul><h3><strong>Extra credit!</strong></h3><ul><li>You’re a senior engineer. If you have 15+ years of experience building complex systems, great!</li><li>You’ve worked on complicated, multiparty workflow systems.</li><li>You’ve dealt with HIPAA and survived with your sanity intact (intactness of sanity is strictly optional).</li><li>You’ve built systems on AWS.</li><li>You’ve worked on streaming video.</li></ul><p>Location: <strong>US Locations Only</strong></p></div></div></div></div>        </div><div>        <a href='https://apply.workable.com/trustsitkacareers/j/916C124197/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We’ve been around since 1991, and we’re still going strong.&nbsp;</p><p>Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.</p><p>Since we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so.</p><p>We work remotely all over the United States and Canada. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won’t have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other.</p><p>Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.</p><p>Here’s an example of some projects we’ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:</p><ul><li>Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login</li><li>Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)</li><li>Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display</li></ul><p><strong>What we want from you: (aka: skills)</strong></p><p>We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience.&nbsp;</p><p>However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.</p><p><strong>Relationship Details:</strong></p><p>We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.</p><p>We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don’t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren’t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project.&nbsp;</p>            </div>        <div>        <a href='https://grnh.se/e53e22833' rel='nofollow'>            Apply        </a>                            </div>            <h4>About Art &amp; Logic, Inc.</h4>            <div><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://artandlogic.com/careers</a></li><li>Visit our Twitter @artandlogic</li></ul></ul>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Art+Logic Conference</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $80-$105K (mid-level), $105K-$125K (Senior).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

It appears to be more thorough, personal, caring, and honest by far than any other I've seen. In my experience there are qualities present in a company's management that tend to permeate through all levels and find expression in many subtle ways. If I am reading into what I am seeing correctly then this would be an exceptional place to work. I'm not sure how to say it other than that. It was just kind of a feeling after looking over the page, that this is where I want to be.</p></blockquote><p>JF, 10/2018</p><blockquote><p>I'm extremely impressed with how much effort your organization puts into describing work opportunities! By far, this is the most helpful job posting I have ever seen. I intend to respond in a point-by-point fashion, as that seems to be the most efficient way to proceed. I hope to repay honesty with honesty.</p></blockquote><p>JH 8/2018:</p><blockquote><p>Like I mentioned before, I really like the whole interview process that you guys have.&nbsp; That in combination with how you guys responded to emails, etc. gave me a very positive impression of your company and I am still interested in working with you guys someday.</p></blockquote><p>LB, 8/2018</p><blockquote><p>The feedback I received from [your first skills assessment] was amazing!&nbsp; That was fantastic! I was really impressed with it.</p></blockquote><p>KM, 9/2018</p><blockquote><p>I just wanted to reach out and give you some really positive feedback. If I could go back in time and finish up those final interviews with you, I would do it in a heartbeat. I can already see a huge difference in personality between you and those who lead the company I joined -- and I think it speaks volumes. Keep being a great person!</p><p>I hope you found a great candidate in the end!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.
