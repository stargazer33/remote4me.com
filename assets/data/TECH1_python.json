What unites us in an intense desire to create the best products, data and tools to help people move around complex cities. We breathe, eat, sleep, and dream mobility and cities from the algorithms to the data to the tools that make the data. Check out our blog at engineering.citymapper.com.<br /><br />We need great engineers who are up to the challenge of making cities usable. There are features to ship, hard problems to solve, and scaling challenges to meet. The fruit is hanging low for smart, motivated people.<br /><br />In addition to the app we solve interesting problems with our paid product Citymapper Pass, a new subscription pass for London integrated with the app experience<br /><br />We're currently hiring across many teams and experience levels. If you believe in what Citymapper is doing — if you're ready to build tech to tackle mobility problems in urban areas  at an interesting scale — give us a shout.<br /><br />We have roles in the following areas:<br /><br />- Backend & internal APIs<br />- Routing systems and algorithms<br />- Pass Fintech stack (mastercard network)<br />- Full-stack web engineers<br />- Site reliability / Operations<br />- Security<br />- Data pipelines<br /><br />Experienced engineers should feel free to apply here as well and indicate any interest in more senior or managerial roles.",

Our first product streamlines recruiting scheduling and coordination, saving teams hundreds of hours a month. We’re just getting started on, and have our sights set on making hiring a great experience for recruiters, hiring managers, and candidates. We’re building the platform to engage these key stakeholders and fix the $200 billion per year hiring industry.   <br>   <br>This is an exceptional opportunity to join a small and fast-growing startup, transforming an industry with powerful and easy to use products customers love. As an early employee you'll have tons of ownership, a big impact on product, a say in our values, and opportunities to tremendously accelerate your career growth.   <br>   <br>We're building a remote team and looking for the best individuals - no matter where you are. All we require is a reliable internet connection and passion for building an amazing company.   <br>   <br>**What We’re Looking For**   <br>   <br>Generalist is too specific a term for you. Back end, front end, database design, infra - you've done it all. Building products end to end is where you shine - you don't like being constrained by titles. You can code the full stack and have built products end to end. You’re comfortable building web apps. If you don't know something, you learn what's needed to get the job done. You want to build something people want. You're product minded and have user empathy.   <br>   <br>We use JavaScript (React), Python (Flask), and SQL (PostgreSQL). We’re hosted on AWS. Having these skills is great, but we know the best engineers can pick them up quickly when needed.   <br>   <br>**What We Value**   <br>   <br>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, challenging the status quo, nothing is “not my job”, having empathy, being direct, and being honest.   <br>   <br>As engineers we believe in picking the right tool for the job, balancing technical excellence with pragmatism, having strong opinions weakly held, and attacking ideas not people.   <br>   <br>**What We Offer**   <br>   <br>* Autonomy, impact, and ownership. As an early employee you’ll shape the product direction and company values.   <br>* Competitive salary and significant equity in a fast growing, early stage startup.   <br>* Remote employment - work where you want, when you want.   <br>* Generous vacation policy - take time whenever you need to recharge. Building a lasting company is a marathon, not a sprint.   <br>* Top-notch healthcare, dental, and vision coverage.   <br>* Life and disability insurance.   <br>* Annual company retreat - helps build camaraderie as a remote team.   <br>* Computer and home office setup - we'll buy anything you need to do your best work.   <br>* Continuing education allowance - learn what you want, when you want.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- USA   <br>  </div> </div>",

The common thread in all that variety is that our projects relate to MVC frameworks.</p><p><strong>Your income</strong></p><p>This is a full time position paid on an hourly basis ($30 per hour for 7+ years of experience, $25 per hour for less). Said in another way, you have more control over your income.</p><p>Earning money based on hourly pay means that you earn money in the exact same way that the company does: billing for time. Paying a salary would put competing incentives between the developer and the company. Instead, we tie your incentives directly in line with the company. So long as you work within our 25-35 hours per week guidelines, your income is 100% tied to how much you work.</p><p>Do you do an amazing job meeting customer expectations with a minimal number of bugs? That's called job security. Customers always have their favorite developers. Make a name for yourself with quality work.</p><p>Engineer ROI also believes that connecting income to time worked maximizes team quality. The kind of people that want to collect a salary and drag the team down are not attracted to the company. That means you will work with talented colleagues that are motivated to make you, the code and the entire team better.</p><p><strong>Quality of Life</strong> - Your work week totals 25-35 hours with 30 being the ideal amount. You can work at any time of day so long as your work hours are consistent and evenly spaced across 4-6 days per week. One of our teammates works from 11 pm - 5 am in his local time zone because that's when he wants to work. The company cares more about you working when you're at your peak mental state rather than the time of day when you work.</p><p>Meetings are strictly limited to when they are necessary. Because your income is based on your time worked (which includes meetings), the company is incentivized to value and protect your work time.</p><p><strong>An Engineer's Environment</strong> - Test driven development comes first. We do not build features until existing code passes all tests. You are assigned tasks with the repository, at which point you are expected to own the problem and fix it. Because we operate in a &quot;no micromanaging&quot; environment, we need a team player that sincerely cares about the impact his/her engineering decisions will have across the project.</p><p>Version control is paramount. Commits to a project are not meant to be a fancy save button. Commits tell the team, &quot;I have tested this feature and it's production ready.&quot;</p><p>The team practices phased releases to minimize the risk of breaking production. Development turns into a commit, which is then passed to staging. Only if staging passes and operates normally do we merge a commit merge from staging to master and release it into production.</p><p>Nobody wants to get yanked out of bed to fix fires (we should not be like IT people on call!). Slow and steady keeps us looking sharp and polished to clients and keeps emergencies to a minimum. It's better for us and it's better for our customers' businesses.</p><p><strong>Small Teams</strong> - The size of the company is 4 total. Your work is meaningful, appreciated and because of the small team size, you have the ability to significantly influence the architecture and frameworks used within a project.</p><p><strong>Technologies</strong></p><p>Django 2.0 and related apps:</p><ul><li>Django REST Framework</li><li>Celery, RabbitMQ</li></ul><p>Laravel and PHP</p><p>HTML5</p><p>Javascript:</p><ul><li>VUE</li><li>Bootstrap</li><li>React</li><li>Node</li><li>JQuery</li></ul><p>Docker, Git</p><p>PostgreSQL</p><p><strong>Must haves</strong></p><p>You must have 2+ years of direct experience with Django. Django is our MVC of choice and the technology that all developers in the organization share in common. In order to be considered for our senior level pay rate of $30/hr, you need to make your case for why you deserve to be a senior level developer.</p><p>Most Django developers also work in the frontend using Javascript and HTML5. Given the choice between an expert in Django and an expert in Javascript, we would choose Django. That said, our teammates need to come on board with a strong foundation in Javascript.</p><p>2+ years of experience using Git for version control.</p><p><strong>Nice to haves</strong></p><p>webpack, Docker, expertise across multiple Javascript libraries, years of experience working with multiple types of databases (especially PostgreSQL). Laravel and PHP are nice to make keep the team as a wide-ranging MVC shop.</p><p><strong>Day to Day</strong></p><p>We intentionally avoid chatter apps like Slack or Skype. Most questions do not require an immediate reply, making threads within the repository's issue tracker our preferred method of communication. The biggest challenge for any developer is to minimize interruptions to help you spend most of your workday in the zone. Keeping chatter restricted to the issue tracking system keeps conversations organized and minimizes distractions. Genuine emergencies are handled over phone calls or What's App.</p><p>About 80%+ of your time is spent architecting or writing code. The remaining time is spent on team communication - reviewing proposed solutions from teammates, clarification on requirements, etc.</p><p>The types of projects and problems you encounter are everything related to MVC frameworks. Identify business problems, abstract them into models and serve the content through a browser.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/201688?reset=False&amp;ra=15DFM45OD8U8&amp;oqs=a%3D15DFM45OD8U8' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Engineer ROI</h3>            <div><p>If forced to choose between technical expertise and teamwork, we choose teamwork every time. Our projects are too large for a single developer to manage on their own. Instead, the project manager distributes tasks in a way that leads to individuals owning large sections of code.</p><p>Because the team is 100% remote and the hours are flexible, everyone places a heavy emphasis on the following:</p><p>- Test driven development. Our code is a reflection of ourselves and our work ethic. Every member of the team needs to see prove to his colleagues that committed code is production ready.</p><p>- Incremental change. Major changes have a way of turning into major problems. Commits are best broken down into bite-sized steps to minimize the introduction of bugs.</p><p>- Proactive ownership over the code base. If you see a problem, create a new issue to ensure that the team addresses problems before clients even know that they exist. Team members are expected to not only find problems, but to feel motivated to fix them without direction.</p><p>Our current projects are for a network of hormone replacement therapy clinics across the United States and a forex managed account program. Both sites have been built from the ground up, ensuring that we have maximum knowledge and expertise across the entire stack.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Remote</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Set Your Own Hours</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

You want to build something people want. You’re product minded and have user empathy.</p><p>We use JavaScript (React), Python (Flask), and SQL (PostgreSQL). We’re hosted on AWS. Having these skills is great, but we know the best engineers can pick them up quickly when needed.</p><p></p><strong>What We Value</strong><p>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, challenging the status quo, nothing is “not my job”, having empathy, being direct, and being honest.</p><p>As engineers we believe in picking the right tool for the job, balancing technical excellence with pragmatism, having strong opinions weakly held, and attacking ideas not people.</p><p></p><strong>What We Offer</strong><ul></ul><li>Autonomy, impact, and ownership. As an early employee you’ll shape the product direction and company values.</li><li>Competitive salary and significant equity in a fast growing, early stage startup.</li><li>Remote employment – work where you want, when you want.</li><li>Generous vacation policy – take time whenever you need to recharge.

Along the way we apply smart algorithms and data mining techniques to analyse the data and extract even more information about places.</p><p>Finally, it goes into a database that powers our API and apps.</p><p>Sound like your cup of tea? Come join us! You'll get to shape the future direction of the pipeline and the travel API, working on adding new features and more smart analysis.</p><p>Our pipeline is implemented in python, using a mapreduce framework.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$95K (mid-level), $95K-115K (Senior).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do.

It appears to be more thorough, personal, caring, and honest by far than any other I've seen. In my experience there are qualities present in a company's management that tend to permeate through all levels and find expression in many subtle ways. If I am reading into what I am seeing correctly then this would be an exceptional place to work. I'm not sure how to say it other than that. It was just kind of a feeling after looking over the page, that this is where I want to be.</p></blockquote><p>JF, 10/2018</p><blockquote><p>I'm extremely impressed with how much effort your organization puts into describing work opportunities! By far, this is the most helpful job posting I have ever seen. I intend to respond in a point-by-point fashion, as that seems to be the most efficient way to proceed. I hope to repay honesty with honesty.</p></blockquote><p>JH 8/2018:</p><blockquote><p>Like I mentioned before, I really like the whole interview process that you guys have.&nbsp; That in combination with how you guys responded to emails, etc. gave me a very positive impression of your company and I am still interested in working with you guys someday.</p></blockquote><p>LB, 8/2018</p><blockquote><p>The feedback I received from [your first skills assessment] was amazing!&nbsp; That was fantastic! I was really impressed with it.</p></blockquote><p>KM, 9/2018</p><blockquote><p>I just wanted to reach out and give you some really positive feedback. If I could go back in time and finish up those final interviews with you, I would do it in a heartbeat. I can already see a huge difference in personality between you and those who lead the company I joined -- and I think it speaks volumes. Keep being a great person!</p><p>I hope you found a great candidate in the end!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.
