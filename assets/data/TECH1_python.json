We are trying to find ways to describe groups of people mathematically. Some groups with well defined structures are easy, such as a company, government or an army. Others are hard: such as a village, academia or an online community interested in bitcoin. We are interested in the latter.</p>  <p>We believe this project can open the doors to solving the fundamental problems in decentralized systems design.</p>  <p><strong>These will be your tasks</strong></p>  <p>As a backend developer you’ll be responsible for managing things like scheduling background tasks, building API routes for our clients, and collecting and storing data from other APIs for use in our algorithms, all the while logging and fixing errors along the way. If you like working with MVC’s transforming and moving data in creative and efficient ways, this if for you.</p>  <p>We are also constantly finding new scaling challenges as we collect more data and users and need to readjust deployment on our servers. We need to manage communication between services, backups, testing, as well as resource management such as memory.</p>  <p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Intermediate Python</li>   <li>A history of using MVC’s like Django or Rails</li>   <li>Basic MySQL</li>   <li>Docker</li>   <li>Be the type of person who is language independent and enjoys using new tech</li>   <li>Git</li>   <li>Basic crontab</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>AWS</li>   <li>NGINX</li>   <li>Kubernetes</li>   <li>Github and its services</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>We’re offering these benefits</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Work on hard &amp; fundamental problems</li>   <li>Equity options</li>   <li>Work from home or office or a cafe (whatever you prefer!)</li>   <li>Work visa sponsorship to Germany (if you wish to relocate)</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>How we work</strong></p>  <p>We are mostly a distributed team of 5 and growing. Most of the team members are located in Europe.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Choose your location:</strong> It would be ideal for you to work with the team in Berlin and we are happy to sponsor a German Work Visa for you. If it is not possible for you to work from Berlin we can also offer that you work remotely.</li>   <li><strong>Regular off-sites:</strong> At least every quarter we make a point for the team to meet in person and work together for a couple of days. We typically rent a big house where we live and work for several days.</li>   <li><strong>Communication:</strong> We use the following tools at work: Slack for instant messaging Asana for task management Standup Alice (Slack bot) for weekly stand-ups 1:1 calls on per need basis</li>   <li><strong>Working time:</strong> We currently do not track your hours worked (eg. Mon-Fri 9-5) however we do expect you deliver results on tasks. We do expect that you will be available on Slack in the afternoon, Central European Time (GMT+1).</li>   <li><strong>Office:</strong> Most of us currently work remotely from home, cafés etc. and you are welcome to do the same. If you work with us in Berlin you can join us in our coworking space to get more of an “office culture”.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Culture of Critical Thinking</strong></p>  <p>One of the biggest risks we face is that we can fool ourselves into believing that we got something to work when we in fact did not. This is because verifying accuracy of our algorithm’s outputs takes a long time and significant infrastructure. This means that an experiment that was not well-thought through enough can lead us to wasting months of work. We cannot afford that. For this reason, it is essential that we build a culture around critical thinking and closely follow the scientific method.</p>  <p>If you are not familiar with Critical Thinking &amp; the Scientific Method, we encourage you to watch the following videos before having a chat with us:</p>  <p>Critical Thinking Course</p>  <p>Richard Feynman discussing the Scientific Method</p>  <p><strong>Big no-no’s</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Calls to authority (“I’ve been doing this for 20 years and you’re just an intern, we’ll do it my way”; “world’s top experts agree that…”)</li>   <li>Discrediting ideas based on their public perception (“If you think that you are a X, Y, Z”)</li>  </ul>  <p>Please include your GitHub account or some kind of portfolio of works within your CV/resume.</p> </div><a href='https://hive.join.com/jobs/292604-backend-developer?pid=98c1261599ca17c51388&amp;utm_source=berlinstartupjobs&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=singlepostingstandard&amp;utm_content=backenddeveloper' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this position</a>",

Home care is supported by some of the most powerful macro factors affecting the global economy: (1) the largest demographic shift in human history; (2) a shift in the $3 trillion dollar healthcare industry from fee-for-service to value-based care, which has expanded reimbursement for home care services; and (3) advancements in telehealth which enable the shift of healthcare from traditional clinical environments to the home.<br> <br><br> <br>Of the over 18 million seniors currently needing home care, 6 million receive care from family members and 1.5 million receive care through home care agencies. Our aging population drives the growth of the home care industry, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day. On top of this core growth, health insurers and other payers are increasingly reimbursing for home care, thus driving an increase in the percentage of seniors that can afford home care and driving an increase from the 1.5 million who receive home care today into the 18 million seniors that need home care in order to stay independent and age-in-place. Over 90% of seniors want to age-in-place: not only is it the most desired outcome, but it is also the most cost-effective.<br> <br><br> <br>Despite tremendous growth, the home care industry, along with the seniors and families it serves, faces numerous challenges. Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.<br> <br><br> <br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.<br> <br><br> <br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.<br> <br><br> <br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the \\&quot;virtual nervous system\\&quot; for the \\&quot;last mile\\&quot; of care for the world's<br> <br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.<br> <br><br> <br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.<br> <br><br> <br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.<br> <br><br> <br>**Top Reasons to Work with Us**<br> <br><br> <br>WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME<br> <br><br> <br>**What You Will Be Doing**<br> <br><br> <br>Build and design a scalable technology stack<br> <br>Approach challenges proactively<br> <br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions<br> <br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership<br> <br>Triage and fix bugs in code<br> <br>Effectively QA and test code<br> <br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)<br> <br><br> <br>**What You Need for this Position**<br> <br><br> <br>Entrepreneurial mindset required<br> <br>Prior experience building an application from scratch<br> <br>Prior Start-up Experience Required<br> <br>Extensive Python/Django experience<br> <br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)<br> <br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction<br> <br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem<br> <br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense<br> <br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus<br> <br>Machine Learning skills is a plus<br> <br><br> <br>- Python<br> <br>- Django<br> <br>- PostgreSQL<br> <br>- Redis<br> <br>- Celery<br> <br>- RabbitMQ<br> <br>- Angular.js<br> <br>- AWS<br> <br>- Startup Experience<br> <br>- JavaScript<br> <br><br> <br>**What's In It for You**<br> <br><br> <br>-Base Salary<br> <br>- Vacation/PTO<br> <br>- Medical<br> <br>- Dental<br> <br>- Vision<br> <br>- Bonus<br> <br>- 401k<br> <br>- Equity Share<br> <br><br> <br>So, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!<br> <br><br> <br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.<br> <br><br> <br><br><br> **CyberCoders, Inc is proud to be an Equal Opportunity Employer** <br><br><br> <br><br> <br><br><br>All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by law.<br><br><br> <br><br> <br><br><br> **Your Right to Work** - In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification document form upon hire.<br><br>*REMOTE CTO - Python, Django, PostgreSQL*<br>*CO-Denver*<br>*CD-1535069* <br> Associated topics: agile, c, chief technology officer, db2, information technology infrastructure library, j2ee, operating system, shell, software development, software manager</div>",

We currently do it in domains as diverse as education and specialised med-tech. Most of our projects start from scratch - an empty .js file or a whiteboard - and it is up to the creativity and technical talent of our team to come up with a great solution.</p><br /><p class=&quot;MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph&quot;>We believe in maximising the freedom of our team members. This means not only location independence and flexible hours, but also freedom to take ownership of projects, and to organise your work in a way that best supports your strengths. Besides freedom, we also believe in taking responsibility. All of us care deeply about building products that exceed the expectations of our clients and their users, and we are not afraid of working hard when it matters.</p><br /><p class=&quot;MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph&quot;>CodeLeap is not only a team of people with a passion for technology, we are proper geeks. As soon as we received our first client payment, we did the most reasonable thing we could think of: we got an Oculus. Outside of work, each of us enjoys being creative and curious - building software tools, DIY robots, playing musical instruments or weird video games.</p><br /><p class=&quot;MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-body1 MuiTypography-paragraph&quot;>If this sounds like the team you&rsquo;d like to join, reach out! We are a young, early stage business, and you could play a very meaningful role in shaping our future.

    "content": "<div>\n Minimum Required Skills:\n <br>Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, RabbitMQ, Angular.js, AWS, Startup Experience, JavaScript\n <br>\n <br>If you are a CTO with experience, please read on!\n <br>\n <br>Home care is a rapidly growing $72 billion dollar industry in the United States serving over 1.5 million people. Home care is supported by some of the most powerful macro factors affecting the global economy: (1) the largest demographic shift in human history; (2) a shift in the $3 trillion dollar healthcare industry from fee-for-service to value-based care, which has expanded reimbursement for home care services; and (3) advancements in telehealth which enable the shift of healthcare from traditional clinical environments to the home.\n <br>\n <br>Of the over 18 million seniors currently needing home care, 6 million receive care from family members and 1.5 million receive care through home care agencies. Our aging population drives the growth of the home care industry, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day. On top of this core growth, health insurers and other payers are increasingly reimbursing for home care, thus driving an increase in the percentage of seniors that can afford home care and driving an increase from the 1.5 million who receive home care today into the 18 million seniors that need home care in order to stay independent and age-in-place. Over 90% of seniors want to age-in-place: not only is it the most desired outcome, but it is also the most cost-effective.\n <br>\n <br>Despite tremendous growth, the home care industry, along with the seniors and families it serves, faces numerous challenges. Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.\n <br>\n <br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.\n <br>\n <br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.\n <br>\n <br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the virtual nervous system for the last mile of care for the world's\n <br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.\n <br>\n <br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.\n <br>\n <br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.\n <br>\n <br>Top Reasons to Work with Us\n <br>\n <br>WORK REMOTELY\n <br>\n <br>What You Will Be Doing\n <br>\n <br>Build and design a scalable technology stack\n <br>Approach challenges proactively\n <br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions\n <br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership\n <br>Triage and fix bugs in code\n <br>Effectively QA and test code\n <br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)\n <br>\n <br>What You Need for this Position\n <br>\n <br>Entrepreneurial mindset required\n <br>Prior experience building an application from scratch\n <br>Prior Start-up Experience Required\n <br>Extensive Python/Django experience\n <br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)\n <br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction\n <br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem\n <br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense\n <br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus\n <br>Machine Learning skills is a plus\n <br>\n <br>- Python\n <br>- Django\n <br>- PostgreSQL\n <br>- Redis\n <br>- Celery\n <br>- RabbitMQ\n <br>- Angular.js\n <br>- AWS\n <br>- Startup Experience\n <br>- JavaScript\n <br>\n <br>What's In It for You\n <br>\n <br>-Base Salary \n <br>- Vacation/PTO\n <br>- Medical\n <br>- Dental\n <br>- Vision\n <br>- Bonus\n <br>- 401k\n <br>- Equity ShareSo, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!\n <br>\n <br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.\n <br>\n <br>Security Clearance will be needed - therefore, only US citizens can be considered.Please apply directly to by clicking 'Click Here to Apply' with your Word resume!\n <br>\n <br>Looking forward to receiving your resume and going over the position in more detail with you.\n <br>\n <br>- Not a fit for this position?

Home care is supported by some of the most powerful macro factors affecting the global economy: (1) the largest demographic shift in human history; (2) a shift in the $3 trillion dollar healthcare industry from fee-for-service to value-based care, which has expanded reimbursement for home care services; and (3) advancements in telehealth which enable the shift of healthcare from traditional clinical environments to the home.\n <br>\n <br>Of the over 18 million seniors currently needing home care, 6 million receive care from family members and 1.5 million receive care through home care agencies. Our aging population drives the growth of the home care industry, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day. On top of this core growth, health insurers and other payers are increasingly reimbursing for home care, thus driving an increase in the percentage of seniors that can afford home care and driving an increase from the 1.5 million who receive home care today into the 18 million seniors that need home care in order to stay independent and age-in-place. Over 90% of seniors want to age-in-place: not only is it the most desired outcome, but it is also the most cost-effective.\n <br>\n <br>Despite tremendous growth, the home care industry, along with the seniors and families it serves, faces numerous challenges. Agencies struggle to efficiently operate amidst complex logistics and regulatory pressures: dozens or hundreds of caregivers operate remotely in the homes of seniors during one of the most difficult periods in life, with limited oversight and delayed visibility to family members into the daily care provided in the home.\n <br>\n <br>Family members suffer from acute pain points associated with the demands of managing a loved one with a deteriorating health condition, often compounded by having to do so from afar. Problems of monitoring the day-to-day care and well-being of a loved one, managing medications, and coordinating with providers and other family members are particularly acute.\n <br>\n <br>For healthcare constituents (providers, payers, and pharmaceutical companies), the patients served by home care agencies are typically among the highest cost and highest utilization, and are characterized by having multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations. Home care today is largely decoupled from the traditional healthcare ecosystem. If healthcare constituents could drive in-home interventions via the home care industry, billions of dollars could be saved each year while simultaneously improving healthcare and aging for millions of people.\n <br>\n <br>Over the past two years, our company has emerged as the market leader serving 8 of the 10 largest home care enterprises and over 4,000 home care agencies nationwide. We power over 250 million hours of care per year, acting effectively as the virtual nervous system for the last mile of care for the world's\n <br>costliest patient population: that is, seniors with multiple chronic conditions and functional limitations.\n <br>\n <br>By virtue of our market leadership and ongoing cadence of innovation, we are rapidly emerging as the system of record for the home care industry. Our new platform sales motion continues to accelerate, and our growth is further buoyed by upsells, which now achieve more than 60% attachment on new accounts.\n <br>\n <br>While the revenue model today is powered by B2B sales to home care agencies, our company's web-based platform solves problems for all of the parties involved in the care of seniors: family members, caregivers, seniors and the broader healthcare community.\n <br>\n <br>Top Reasons to Work with Us\n <br>\n <br>WORK REMOTELY FROM HOME\n <br>\n <br>What You Will Be Doing\n <br>\n <br>Build and design a scalable technology stack\n <br>Approach challenges proactively\n <br>Design and utilize third-party APIs to core systems and healthcare institutions\n <br>Effectively communicate technical solutions and roadmap to leadership\n <br>Triage and fix bugs in code\n <br>Effectively QA and test code\n <br>Ability to build and strengthen a team of developers (employees and freelancers)\n <br>\n <br>What You Need for this Position\n <br>\n <br>Entrepreneurial mindset required\n <br>Prior experience building an application from scratch\n <br>Prior Start-up Experience Required\n <br>Extensive Python/Django experience\n <br>Full-stack experience (will be working on both front and back end)\n <br>Balanced ego- able to take ownership and action while collaborating and receiving direction\n <br>Excellent creative problem solver- able to come up with unusual or clever ideas about a given topic or situation, or to develop creative ways to solve a problem\n <br>Strong deductive reasoning- able to apply general rules to specific problems to produce answers that make sense\n <br>Prior experience in Healthcare or Elderly services is a plus\n <br>Machine Learning skills is a plus\n <br>\n <br>- Python\n <br>- Django\n <br>- PostgreSQL\n <br>- Redis\n <br>- Celery\n <br>- RabbitMQ\n <br>- Angular.js\n <br>- AWS\n <br>- Startup Experience\n <br>- JavaScript\n <br>\n <br>What's In It for You\n <br>\n <br>-Base Salary \n <br>- Vacation/PTO\n <br>- Medical\n <br>- Dental\n <br>- Vision\n <br>- Bonus\n <br>- 401k\n <br>- Equity ShareSo, if you are a CTO with experience, please apply today!\n <br>\n <br>Applicants must be authorized to work in the U.S.\n <br>\n <br>Security Clearance will be needed - therefore, only US citizens can be considered.Please apply directly to by clicking 'Click Here to Apply' with your Word resume!\n <br>\n <br>Looking forward to receiving your resume and going over the position in more detail with you.\n <br>\n <br>- Not a fit for this position?

We conduct rigorous analyses of tax and economic proposals and provide data-driven recommendations on how to shape equitable and sustainable tax systems. ITEP’s expertise and data uniquely enhance federal, state, and local policy debates by revealing how taxes affect both public revenues and people of various levels of income and wealth as well as other demographic characteristics like race and ethnicity.</p>\n <p>We believe that taxes are the building blocks of a thriving economy and society, providing the resources for necessary investments in our communities. To move toward a vision where federal, state, and local tax systems raise enough revenue to fund common priorities and do so in a manner that promotes shared prosperity for all, we promote common sense tax policies that are responsive to our ever-changing economy and that raise revenue in an equitable and sustainable way.</p>\n <p>The technical engine behind our work is ITEP’s Microsimulation Tax Model. Developed in 1996, the model computes the revenue yield and incidence of federal, state and local taxes, including both current tax law and proposed tax law changes. The model is unique in its ability to produce analysis at the federal and state levels and to analyze income, consumption and property taxes.</p>\n <p>We seek a <strong>Senior Software Engineer (Full Stack) </strong>to join ITEP’s creative, passionate and productive staff team as our Lead Tax Model Platform Developer.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>As the Lead Tax Model Platform Developer, you will begin working with an existing Python code base and complete the migration of the model from a legacy platform to the new Python platform. Completion of this project will set up ITEP’s tax model in a sustainable web-based environment, preserving our current model’s functionality and generating sufficient flexibility for longer-term development of content and user-driven enhancements.</li>\n  <li>Beyond the platform migration, ongoing responsibilities include timely problem-solving to adapt the platform to respond to frequent tax policy proposals and changes, improving the efficiency of the platform to make users more productive, collaborating with our senior economist to integrate updated data, and developing a lengthy product roadmap (including external facing products that make our model accessible to state and national partners).</li>\n </ul>\n <p>This role reports directly to ITEP’s senior economist and works closely with the entire policy analyst team.</p>\n <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Lead front and backend technical development work as part of the reconfiguration of ITEP’s microsimulation tax model—currently based on legacy Visual Fox Pro (VFP) code—to a Python web app (built on the Django framework) to be deployed on an Azure platform.</li>\n  <li>Lead the technical development, integration and iterative improvement of ITEP’s tax modeling capacities.</li>\n  <li>Communicate clearly with multiple constituencies, soliciting and digesting feedback from both technical and non-technical users.</li>\n  <li>Ensure that all code development, data handling and version control are done efficiently, securely, transparently and in a manner that improves user productivity and timeliness.</li>\n  <li>Support documentation of ITEP’s model processes.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Contribute fundamentally to ITEP’s mission as a progressive tax policy organization. Interact with the software development communities, representing the high quality of engineering work at ITEP.</li>\n  <li>Opportunities to deepen your technical architecture skills or develop technical management skills based on your career aspirations.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Required Experience and Skills</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Three to five years of experience as a full stack software engineer.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Specific experience with:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>managing cloud deployments (e.g., Azure, AWS and/or Google Cloud);</li>\n  <li>managing Python web app development;</li>\n  <li>designing server-side and client-side architecture;</li>\n  <li>optimizing database function and management (ideally PostgreSQL);</li>\n  <li>using object-relational mapping (ORM).</li>\n  <li>Ability to manage two or more concurrent projects, working both independently as well as with a team.</li>\n  <li>Ability to effectively communicate with non-technical users, responding effectively to user needs.</li>\n  <li>Ability to write effective technical documentation.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>In addition, other helpful (though not necessary) experience would include having worked remotely on a software development team and having developed and deployed software for governments and/or nonprofit organizations.</p>\n <p><strong>Start date:</strong> Preferred start date is August 2019.</p>\n <p><strong>Location: Flexible. ITEP is located in Washington, DC, however we are open to hiring a remote staff member for this position.

The person hired in this role will work to ensure that Hypothesis technologies and services support our vision of a world where annotation is as common as comments, but more useful and engaging. Join us as we extend what the web can do. \n  <br> \n  <br>About the team \n  <br> \n  <br>Hypothesis is a small non-profit with big aspirations. We work with educators, online publishers, journalists, and scientists to unlock new capabilities and workflows on the web. \n  <br> \n  <br>We are a diverse, supportive, highly collaborative, 100% remote team of technologists, educators, scientists, and business people working together to bring new capabilities to the web. We code in the open (our repos are public and liberally licensed) and help drive standards for annotation. We communicate via Slack, video chat, GitHub, and Google Docs across 9 time zones. \n  <br> \n  <br>About the role \n  <br> \n  <br>In this role, you will help build systems and APIs to support annotation of web pages and other media. You will focus on solving for user needs by contributing on backend systems and services. The following is a sampling of the technologies we currently use: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Python, Pyramid, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch \n  <br> \n  <br>* AWS, Docker, Terraform \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>This role reports to the Engineering Manager \n  <br> \n  <br>About you \n  <br> \n  <br>You are someone who loves problem solving.
