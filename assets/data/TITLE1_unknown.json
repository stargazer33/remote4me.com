We connect people with health needs to companies who can help them.</p><p>That means we run online ads to find people in need of medical procedures or treatment, they ask for help or more information, and then we call them to convince them to take action and schedule and attend an appointment with one of our partner doctors.</p><p>Right now we need a few more folks to help with those calls.That’s where you come in.</p><p><strong>What’s your role in all this?</strong></p><p>We are expanding our outreach team as our clients continue to grow. No, it’s not cold calling, but there is persuasion involved. The people our outreach team calls have requested information and typically want their health problem solved. This is a medical sales position.</p><p><strong>So, who is our company?</strong></p><p>We are 83bar. Yes, that’s our name. 83bar is the maximum amount of pressure a fire hose can put out, which describes what we do well for our clients. We work hard to make sure our clients can help as many people as possible. We’re a company that believes in “doing well while doing good.”</p><p><strong>What makes us unique?</strong></p><p>A few things. We work with cutting edge healthcare companies, which is always fun, and we’re a virtual company. We have employees in Texas, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, Florida and many other states. We work online and enjoy what we do, but without the stuffy office.</p><p>Currently Hiring for part time positions – and we are looking applicants available to&nbsp;<strong>work shifts between 7am and 10 pm CST.</strong>&nbsp;If you do well, full time could become an option.</p><p>We’ve custom built a system that lets you log in do your job wherever you want to. You just need access to high speed Internet.</p><p>If you are smart, detail-oriented, don’t mind calling people, and have availability, you might be a fit for us.</p><p>One key benefit we offer our clients is medically trained outreach clinical specialists. We have found that nurses have both the clinical knowledge and the empathy required to successfully connect with the people we are reaching out to help, and educate them about the life-changing services our clients have to offer.</p><p>Bonus points if you’ve done outbound calling before, have worked with CRMs, or have previous sales experience.</p><p>We need applicants who are willing to become experts in our clients’ services and the disease processes that they treat. In addition, we are looking for people who are skilled at connecting with patients and convincing them to take the next step to get their health problems solved. The key to success in this position is the ability to persuade people to take action, and overcome their skepticism in trying something new.</p><p>Our outreach team is responding immediately when a new consumer reaches out to us. We make it easy for you to “punch in” and “punch out”, but&nbsp;<strong>if your schedule is too hectic and you can’t dedicate a consistent 20 hours a week, please do not apply.</strong></p><p><strong>Details about the position</strong></p><p>Pay: $30/hour (paid bi-weekly with direct deposit)</p><p>Schedule: Because consumers reach out to us at all hours, we’re staffing for many different time frames and would like to hear from you when you are available.<strong>&nbsp;This position is part-time, but it does require a commitment to a consistent schedule where you will be logged in and working in our system. (The minimum commitment is 20 hours a week. Full time is an option depending on experience.)</strong></p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p><strong>We work remotely and you don’t have to drive to work!</strong></p><p><strong>About our clients</strong></p><p>As you have probably figured out, our clients aren’t your typical healthcare companies like a hospital or insurance provider. Instead, we work with creative, relatively new companies with innovative solutions trying to help people solve their health issues in new ways. These new companies need awareness and that’s where we come in. We use cutting-edge lead generation and sales automation to help consumers find our clients.</p><p><strong>Here are a few examples of folks we work with:</strong></p><ul><li>A DNA lab testing company that helps people discover if they are at risk of hereditary cancers.</li><li>A services company that treats people with prediabetes and prevents them from developing Type II diabetes. One-third of adults have prediabetes!</li><li>A medical device company that helps women who have been struggling with bladder control for years.</li><li>Too many to list them all here.</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Experienced, Licensed Nurse (RNs )</li><li>Experience in Sales</li><li>Customer Service Experience</li><li>Detail Oriented</li><li>Ability to Commit to a Set Weekly Schedule</li></ul><p>To apply: Please complete the application and respond with a short paragraph or two on why you think you’re a fit. Please attach your resume and also add in what experience you’ve had (if any) working with a virtual company, in sales, on the phone, and in health care.</p><p>Once you have completed the above step please click on the link below and complete our pre-test. This is MANDATORY and we will not be able to schedule any interviews or consider you if this pre-test is not completed.</p><p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYdZhxQl7PARpnnNbKKA4E7ohP3xFuTbSRIsUh62bVCxGAfg/viewform</p><p>Please do NOT call our office to inquire about the role or ask about your application status. We receive a high volume of applications and are unable to return calls. Complete all the steps outlined, and if we think you are a good fit, we will contact you.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p>$30/hour</p><p><strong>Work from home.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://83bar.workable.com/jobs/1059724' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Your intelligence and talent are not fixed; they're developed over time through perseverance, dedication, and hard work.</li><li>Calm the Chaos: Urgency leads to errors; frenzy to frustration. We focus on developing the steady working rhythm and calm mind that works best for solving complex problems.</li><li>Communication is Just as Important as Code: No one at Corgibytes identifies themselves as a “technical” or “non-technical” because everyone is both. Practice both types of skills regularly.</li><li>Craft in Context: Match your solution to the situation. Sometimes it’s a quick and dirty prototype to prove a concept. When the stakes are high, spending extra time getting it right is the best way to go.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Does that sound like you? Awesome! We live these values every day, and they’re a guide in making decisions, no matter how small. They’ve helped us develop a culture where folks are autonomous, responsible, and work hard without feeling burned out or like they have to choose between family and work. We’re the type of company where it’s common to see a toddler bouncing on a knee during a meeting. As an intentionally distributed team, we focus more on results than micromanagement. Our core values are key to our culture, as are our pillars of autonomy, balance, diversity, and trust.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in this type of position -- if you enjoy managing details, keeping people accountable, rolling up your sleeves to just get the job done -- but don’t quite have the experience, try anyway. Many skills are transferable.</div><div><br>Click <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzA9x3Qv90sNhk2JpSY8MHcTRpew84PREwDnA-EPvrfKkwHg/viewform' rel='nofollow'>here</a> to apply.</div></div>",

It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the &quot;Usain Bolt of cyber­security&quot; [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].</p><p>The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is &quot;game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes.&quot; [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as &quot;high risk&quot;. [4]</p><p>Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].</p><p>Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.</p><p>Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.</p><p>We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.</p><p>We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.</p><p>Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].</p><p>--</p><p>Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.</p><p>Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.</p><p>No one says &quot;not my job&quot;, and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year. (95% of my work is JS, though - you do mostly stick to your job ;)</p><p>On-site or US Remote: <a href='https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&amp;t=Engineering&amp;gh_src=b44d958b1#openings' rel='nofollow'>https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&amp;t=Engineering&amp;g...</a></p><p>--</p><p>Enterprise Services Engineer - This is a new role in response to customer demand, where we're managing Tanium software directly for customers instead of only training and advising their employees.</p><p>Additional roles open in US Remote or on site in Fort Belvoir, Quantico, Washington D.C., or Reston:</p><p><a href='https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&amp;t=Enterprise%20Services%20Organization&amp;gh_src=r64ytqkl1#openings' rel='nofollow'>https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&amp;t=Enterprise%20...</a></p><p>--</p><p>Associate or Director of Technical Account Management - The TAM organization is central to our company, and doesn't have any real parallels that I'm aware of. As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.</p><p>(Note: &quot;Director&quot; is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)</p><p>The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.</p><p>These roles are primarily remote/work from home, but we try to have them near the customers they support.

Three trends motivated us: First, underserved populations living in our biggest cities have continued to have disproportionately poor health outcomes, with interventions coming much later and at a significantly higher cost than for other populations. Second, nearly all innovation efforts have been focused on people with means, despite urgent need in underserved lower-income communities. And finally, the business of healthcare has become increasingly transactional, leaving little room for meaningful relationships between patients and clinicians, driving increased dissatisfaction among both. We set out to challenge this status quo.\n <br>\n <br>We share the conviction that inequity in health is both unacceptable and solvable. Together, we are re-imagining the future of community health in cities, with a goal of driving health system change at scale.\n <br>\n <br>We're preparing to launch our first Neighborhood Health Hub in early 2018.
