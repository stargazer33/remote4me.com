I am the founder of KitNations, and I created a survival kit for people settling in London (and soon Paris, Montreal, LA, Singap...).<br /><br />The job will consist of:<br /><br />1. Contacting pubs, bars, restaurants all over London to create partnerships<br /><br />2. Creating some cool content and posting on Insta/Fb/Snap...<br /><br />3. Help me in many other tasks, grinding daily, and see THE REAL STARTUP LIFE from inside.<br /><br />If you always wondered what it could be like to launch your own company, bootstrap, grind, and make a cool product, join me!<br /><br />You're not afraid of pushing it to the limits and propose new ideas/learn new skills everyday? The ambience is very relaxed, but we will be grinding hard, and I will be raising a good seed in a few months, so why not hire you later on? <br /><br />I can't pay you though (not yet). Flexible hours. Looking for someone that likes things done well. <br /><br />Juste send me a DM with the skills you already have (Indesign? Photoshop? Coding? Photography? Video? I want someone that is eager to learn and multi-task). No formalities please!<br /><br />The job is in Camberwell/Brixton but you can work from home, we'll see together. <br /><br />Check what we do before you apply and if you believe in the idea, DM and tell me in a few words what you would like to bring to the concept!<br />"

I work with entrepreneur and speaker Till H. Gross and together we run Course Concierge. We’re an online course publishing house that develops courses for </span><em>NYT</em><span> best-selling authors, TED speakers and those with something to say.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>For the right person, this is a Dream Opportunity — and dream company. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re a year-and-a-half-old and growing, and looking for a Managing Producer to oversee and orchestrate our productions – design, development, marketing, editorial and film.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our clients include YouTubers with 150,000,000 views, one of the most hotly-followed health experts on Instagram, and a coach to NFL athletes, NBA players and U.S. special forces.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Check us out here: </span><a href='http://courseconcierge.com' rel='nofollow'><span>http://courseconcierge.com</span></a></div><div><br></div><div><span>Online courses, for the most part, have a lethargic reputation. Compared with today’s video games things are still in the primitive stages – about as far evolved as </span><em>Pong</em><span>. But online courses’ possibilities are endless, and that’s something we’re set to override. A book is a book. An online course is, well, anything you want it to be. There’s a promise of the internet that’s yet to be delivered, and we’d like to be its bearer. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Each production is a serious operation, and we have many going on at the same time. There’s a picture of U.S. chess champion Bobby Fischer playing 50 games simultaneously that’s something of a comparison. We’re looking for someone who can manage four or more client productions at the same time, on topics as varied as cyber security and yoga. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Producing has a great reverence in the music world. We’d like someone who can help bring about the same in online education.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our early works have been supremely effective – we know how to drive action. The below is just one week following the release of “The Weekend Woodworker”, a course we helped produce with Steve Ramsey:</span></div><div><br></div><div><a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/BbKigoaH1VU/?taken-by=steveramsey_wwmm' rel='nofollow'><span>https://www.instagram.com/p/BbKigoaH1VU/?taken-by=steveramsey_wwmm</span></a></div><div><br></div><div><span>One heuristic for a course for strength coaches: “I’d happily have this person train my mum &amp; dad after taking this”. Another all-purpose: “Would I be comfortable selling this to my best friend?” (We need courses for which the answer is a resounding Yes.)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You need to have a definite interest in online learning, curriculum development and the future of education . To have ideas about online courses – what they should look like and feel like.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Also, you need to be something of an operational whiz. “Project management” is an awful term that does no justice to the majesty required to get the most out of a team.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our ideal candidate...</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Is a strong leader. You can drive a team to move forward, you know what a great product looks like, and you can help deliver one on time.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Considers themselves a coach. We want someone who can get the very best out of everyone on the team (and clients) – a nurturer.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Has a philosophy of learning. We want someone for whom, pent up from all the things you think wrong with the school educational system, wants to put things right and help us rewrite the rules.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Can be both a “maker” (rolling up your sleeves to do things) and a manager – able to switch between the two effortlessly.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Is willing and able to fly to our clients’ shoots. You’ll be a guiding hand with our film director – as many as eight shoots a year, shot in North America.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Can guide smooth handoffs between team members. You have the ability to push responsibility widely throughout a team, while at the same time keeping a close eye to things.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Can hold their own with some seriously accomplished clientele. As well as managing the team, you’re client facing. You’re guiding their production and you’ll need to charm them and have them bought into your ability to do so to the utmost.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Is able (with a bit of help from us) to recruit designers, developers and continue to build our brilliant team as we grow.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Knows how to politely say “no” when necessary.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re a great company to join. Here’s why…</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- The company is still young (just 18 months) and you will be getting in at the ground level. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Despite the company being young, we’ve a combined experience of several decades in online course production and marketing. We have an unbelievably engaged team, with world-class people in every department – from video production to design to development to copywriting and editorial.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- We’ve got our ducks in a row. We’re a company that has our house in order and we’ve structured things very deliberately. We have a system across the company and battle-proven workflows. The foundation is here, and it’ll be yours to build upwards.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- Our clients are fantastic. We have the good fortune to be selective in who we work with, and many have a great sense of mission in what they do.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- We’re a remote company and you have the freedom to work from anywhere. Preferably we’re looking for someone in North America or Europe, but are open to candidates the world over. (Our current team spans 13 time zones.)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>- We’re going places.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>*</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Pay will be set at a competitive rate, and we’re happy to work with notice periods, transitioning to you coming on full-time when ready.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Please do not send a CV – we don’t care where, or even whether, you went to school –&nbsp; but do tell us why you’d be a good fit and include experience that would help you to command the position.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><span>There’s no deadline to reply, but we’re looking to fill the post soon and so please </span><a href='mailto:producer@courseconcierge.com' rel='nofollow'><span>get in touch</span></a><span> as early as is convenient.</span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We won’t be able to get back to everyone, but for those whose notes stand out, we’ll be in touch to ask further questions and set up a phone interview.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Thank you for considering the position and reading this far.

This is the first step.  </p><p>Next, we change how executables run on Android so that every application and its data, regardless if its a system app or one you download, runs in its own isolated

This is the first step.  </p><p>Next, we change how executables run on Android so that every application and its data, regardless if its a system app or one you download, runs in its own isolated environment.  </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Diego</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Android</span>, <span>Tablets</span>, <span>Cyber Security</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/secureduniverse' rel='nofollow'>@secureduniverse</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://blog.secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>http://blog.secureduniverse.com</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>secureduniverse.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Secured Universe</h3><ul><li><div>Design Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/73428-ui-ux-jedi' rel='nofollow'>UI/UX Jedi</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69250-aosp-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>AOSP Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69253-virtualization-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Virtualization Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69254-full-stack-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Full Stack Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69401-machine-learning-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Machine Learning Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Operations Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69045-cfo-co-fundraiser' rel='nofollow'>CFO &amp;

Unfortunately, appointments are spread across many services and we are still wasting a lot of time in back-and-forth emails or phone calls. It's often impossible to share real-time availability with others because Outlook and Google Calendar don't work cross-company.</p><p>FreeBusy is a scheduling assistant powered by A.I. to coordinate meetings 10x faster with contacts inside and outside your company. You can interact with FreeBusy on the web, smartphone, and desktop, using voice, chat, and email. FreeBusy <br>works with existing calendars (Google, Office 365, Exchange, iCloud, Outlook.com, etc.) and you can link as many as you have (work, personal, school). Easily share unified availability with business contacts whether they use FreeBusy or not.</p><p>Our current focus is to increase enterprise agility when scheduling meetings cross-company.

You will constantly be challenged to learn new technologies and extend your knowledge of Iridium’s products. &nbsp;We offer a very agile and empowered environment – if you have a great idea, speak up and present it to the team. If the team loves your idea, then we will look for you to implement it.&nbsp;</p><p>Iridium is an 8-year old company that thinks it is still a startup.&nbsp; What is nice is that we have the startup attitude, but also offer stable and long-term employment with a company that has positive cash flow and is not concerned about running out of money.&nbsp; We offer the start-up mindset, but without the fear that we will close our doors next month.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking for a relaxing job where you can work 8-5 Monday through Friday, then this is not the job for you. The Iridium work experience is fast-paced and high intensity. You will be a member of a team of extremely talented and highly skilled technical employees. We all bring our “whatever it takes attitude” to solving both technical and client issues. You will be empowered to showcase your technical skills and grit on a daily basis. You will be given massive responsibility and be expected to independently manage yourself. We can promise overtime, late nights, and even some weekend work. But we can also promise a great sense of achievement, and a supportive team environment that makes it all worthwhile. Are you a hard-charger?

We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

We empower you to create the startup experience that you want and give you the opportunities to challenge yourself. We expect that you walk away from this with the necessary skills and knowledge to launch your own startup.</p><p>This internship will let get your hands dirty in all parts of the business. From hustling, growth hacking, community building, business development, operations, product development, leading a team, customer care to cooking, no two days are ever the same and we like it that way. If you want to wake up knowing exactly how your day will end then this is probably not the right role for you.</p><p>And yep, we also feed you a lot of really good food (that's a given).</p></div></div><div><div>Compensation</div><div>$1K–$2K<br>No Equity</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to dahmakan (YC S17)</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/zursh-2/jobs/239556-ai-trainer-data-analyst-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/zursh-2/jobs/239556-ai-trainer-data-analyst-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>AI Trainer/Data Analyst Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/zursh-2/jobs/239556-ai-trainer-data-analyst-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>ZURSH</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/252929-head-of-operations?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/252929-head-of-operations?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Head of Operations</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/252929-head-of-operations?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>dahmakan (YC S17)</a></div><div>Malaysia, Asia</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/statslateral/jobs/275474-founding-market-research-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/statslateral/jobs/275474-founding-market-research-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Founding Market Research Manager</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/statslateral/jobs/275474-founding-market-research-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>StatsLateral</a></div><div>Toronto</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/merkle-8/jobs/324101-crypto-financial-indices-product-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/merkle-8/jobs/324101-crypto-financial-indices-product-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Crypto financial indices Product...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/merkle-8/jobs/324101-crypto-financial-indices-product-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Merkle Data</a></div><div>Palo Alto, New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/113989-summer-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/113989-summer-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Summer Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/113989-summer-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Forkable</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/114401-intern-anytime?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/114401-intern-anytime?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Intern (Anytime)</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/114401-intern-anytime?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Forkable</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/308585-country-manager-thailand?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/308585-country-manager-thailand?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Country Manager Thailand</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/308585-country-manager-thailand?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>dahmakan (YC S17)</a></div><div>Bangkok, Thailand</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/150377-offline-marketing-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/150377-offline-marketing-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Offline Marketing Manager</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/dahmakan-yc-s17/jobs/150377-offline-marketing-manager?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>dahmakan (YC S17)</a></div><div>Malaysia</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/munchh-pvt-ltd/jobs/199615-internships?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/munchh-pvt-ltd/jobs/199615-internships?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Internships</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/munchh-pvt-ltd/jobs/199615-internships?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Munchh</a></div><div>Kuala Lumpur, Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>What We're Building</h3></div><div><div><p>Eating well everyday is simple: At the push of a button, dahmakan delivers Chef-made meals straight to your door.

If you are not solid on T-SQL, please do not apply.&nbsp; Our programming test for all applicants is based on T-SQL through SSMS.<br><br>The position of BI Consultant/Developer requires candidates with very strong development skills. You will be in touch with our British team, so good English is a must. We are looking for applicants who are entrepreneurial, incredibly bright, organized, focused, creative problem solvers, able to work independently, extremely hard-working, and who embrace the home office-based lifestyle.<br><br>Salary<br><br>Salary is set depending on your experience. If you can pass our application process we will be able to agree on a salary that works for you.&nbsp;<br><br>Job Responsibilities<br><br>The role encompasses a combination of consulting and development duties, including:&nbsp;<br><br><br>* You will be in close touch with our top consultants (mainly in UK) to help implement, customize and support Iridium BI products&nbsp;<br><br>* Report/dashboard design and development&nbsp;<br><br>* Manage client product implementations and projects to successful outcomes&nbsp;<br><br>* You will also be in touch with our development team located in Prague, Czech Republic<br><br>* Design, code, deploy, and test client-specific customizations and enhancements&nbsp;<br><br>* Design, code, deploy, and test Iridium BI product features and enhancements&nbsp;<br><br>* Development of software tools for internal use&nbsp;<br><br>* Technical investigations&nbsp;<br><br>* Client support<br><br><br><br><br>Required Skills<br><br><br>* Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Information Technology, or similar&nbsp;<br><br>* Strong development skills and experience.&nbsp;Our technologies are SQL Server (relational database, T-SQL, SSAS, SSRS), HTML5, Angular JS, C# and others. While we prefer experience with these technologies, we will consider developers that are familiar with other technologies - our thinking is that hard-core coders can learn any technology stack.&nbsp;<br><br>* Good written/oral English&nbsp;<br><br>* We develop software for law firms. Experience in Legal IT (ADERANT, Elite Enterprise, Elite 3E) is a big plus, but is not required<br><br><br><br><br>Life at Iridium Technology<br><br>About Iridium Technology<br><br>Does this get you excited?&nbsp;<br>Living in Czech or Slovak Republic, getting a great salary, flexible hours, and our friendly vacation policy.&nbsp; And more importantly, no commute and no parking problems, because a lot of your time will be spent working out of your home office!<br><br>Note that if you don't want to work from a home office, we will cover the cost of membership in a co-working environment (such as Impact Hub).<br><br>Work Environment<br><br>Iridium provides a great environment for developers to learn new technologies and show off their skills.&nbsp; First of all, this is a company that is run by developers. 25 out of our 30 employees have degrees in Computer Science or IT.&nbsp; We love to code, design architectures, streamline processes, and are relentlessly striving for constant improvement.&nbsp; We have modern/relevant technology stack, and we are moving aggressively into implementing the Microsoft Azure BI/AI capabilities.&nbsp; Each developer is assigned to a team with 4-5 members, and collaborative programming and collaborative problem-solving are highly encouraged. You will constantly be challenged to learn new technologies and extend your knowledge of Iridium’s products. &nbsp;We offer a very agile and empowered environment – if you have a great idea, speak up and present it to the team. If the team loves your idea, then we will look for you to implement it.&nbsp;<br><br>Iridium is an 8-year old company that thinks it is still a startup.&nbsp; What is nice is that we have the startup attitude, but also offer stable and long-term employment with a company that has positive cash flow and is not concerned about running out of money.&nbsp; We offer the start-up mindset, but without the fear that we will close our doors next month.&nbsp;<br><br>If you are looking for a relaxing job where you can work 8-5 Monday through Friday, then this is not the job for you. The Iridium work experience is fast-paced and high intensity. You will be a member of a team of extremely talented and highly skilled technical employees. We all bring our “whatever it takes attitude” to solving both technical and client issues. You will be empowered to showcase your technical skills and grit on a daily basis. You will be given massive responsibility and be expected to independently manage yourself. We can promise overtime, late nights, and even some weekend work. But we can also promise a great sense of achievement, and a supportive team environment that makes it all worthwhile. Are you a hard-charger? If so, you will fit right in and you will love working here.<p>See more jobs at <span>Iridium Technology</span></p></div></div>"

You only need to look at our public quarterly reports to see the massive growth our company has achieved. We’ve been on the Inc. 5000 list of fastest growing American companies twice now! In 2016, we came in at 161, and last year, we came in at 172.<br>And we’re just getting started!<br>You will play a pivotal role in helping us grow, organize and vet future hires for the company. As the HR Coordinator you will be performing background checks on our potential employees, review and revise our hiring emails, update and maintain our career boards and other tasks associated with hiring new talent for the company.<br>You will spend the first 4-6 months with us in SE Asia training with our management team. This position has the potential to become location-independent once your training is done and you can expect some travel. (SE Asia, Europe, US, etc.) You will be in a probationary period for the first six months, and afterwards we’ll have you up and running as an HR Coordinator.<br>You should either be a digital nomad or interested in the digital nomad lifestyle. This is very important for this role, since our entire company is remote and our people are regularly on the move. We would need you to be knowledgeable about the unique challenges that comes with managing such a remote team so you can best serve them.<br>Ideally, we would want you to be based primarily out of SE Asia since so much of our team tends to live in this part of the world. This would allow you to meet face to face with the team fairly regularly and also travel to several events we do around the region every year.<p>See more jobs at <span>Empire Flippers</span></p><p>Visit <a href='https://empireflippers.com/' rel='nofollow'>Empire Flippers</a>'s website</p></div></div>"
