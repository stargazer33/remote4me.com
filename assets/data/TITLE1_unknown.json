Three trends motivated us: First, underserved populations living in our biggest cities have continued to have disproportionately poor health outcomes, with interventions coming much later and at a significantly higher cost than for other populations. Second, nearly all innovation efforts have been focused on people with means, despite urgent need in underserved lower-income communities. And finally, the business of healthcare has become increasingly transactional, leaving little room for meaningful relationships between patients and clinicians, driving increased dissatisfaction among both. We set out to challenge this status quo.<br><br>We share the conviction that inequity in health is both unacceptable and solvable. Together, we are re-imagining the future of community health in cities, with a goal of driving health system change at scale.<br><br>We're preparing to launch our first Neighborhood Health Hub in early 2018.

It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the &quot;Usain Bolt of cyber­security&quot; [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].</p><p>The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is &quot;game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes.&quot; [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as &quot;high risk&quot;. [4]</p><p>Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].</p><p>Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.</p><p>Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.</p><p>We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.</p><p>We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more.

I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.</p><p>Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.</p><p>No one says &quot;not my job&quot;, and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year.

However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.</p><p>(Note: &quot;Director&quot; is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)</p><p>The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.</p><p>TAM roles are primarily remote/work from home, but we try to have them near the customers they support.

Infosec Consultant</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>Carve Systems</h3></span> <div>  <div>   <br>Update May&nbsp;2019: The Carve team is looking for people who like to hack.&nbsp;If you are interested in what you read below, please apply and we'll get you started on the process. Got questions? You'll get a short intro call very early in the process. This is the best place to raise any questions you might have. We have a special interest for candidates in the NYC&nbsp;region but if you can hack lets talk. Thanks ...the Carve team.   <br>   <br>What's the job?   <br>   <br>   <br>* Information security consulting: assessing the security of software and hardware systems.   <br>   <br>* Understanding how systems are built and learning how to break them.   <br>   <br>* Working with our experienced team on short-to-medium term engagements.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>What would you do?   <br>   <br>Every two to three weeks you'll get a new project to work on. A typical project will involve:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Recon: Digging into the functionality, design, and implementation of the software system or device.   <br>   <br>* Probing: Searching for implementation weaknesses which could indicate a security issue. This is a combination of tools that we use, tools that we build, and manual probing. For device projects this can include firmware extraction, analysis, and hardware interfacing.   <br>   <br>* Extending: Now that you've found a weakness... how far can you extend your access into the system?   <br>   <br>* Writing: Now that you've hacked your way in you'll need to write-up your findings and work with the developers to make sure they understand what the problem is and how to fix it.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>If you enjoy puzzles and technical variety you'll find this job very enjoyable.   <br>   <br>Who are we looking for?   <br>   <br>   <br>* You do not need to have information security experience. If you've got the right technical background and problem solving skills we can train you in the dark arts of infosec.   <br>   <br>* People who enjoy writing code, solving problems with code, and learning how computers work at a fundamental level.   <br>   <br>* This is not a &quot;travel every week&quot; type of consultant. We do sometimes work at a client site but most of the time we do our projects remotely.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We’re hiring for all experience levels: from zero career experience to information security veterans.   <br>   <br>Skills &amp; Requirements   <br>   <br>   <br>* Deep experience in software and computers. You may have earned this experience with a degree, career as a software developer, or perhaps you've invested in a technical hobby that took you deep into the rabbit hole.   <br>   <br>* Technical writing skills (English)   <br>   <br>* Resident of the USA and able to be employed in the USA.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We encourage remote candidates to reply *if* they are residents of the USA.  </div> </div>",
