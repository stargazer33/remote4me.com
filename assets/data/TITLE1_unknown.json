We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.</p><p>We're a startup — we're 600+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.</p><p>We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 24 states.</p><p>We've raised $180M in Venture Capital since 2015 and we're scaling rapidly. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.</p><p>Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.</p><p>We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.</p><p>Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.</p>",

It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the &quot;Usain Bolt of cyber­security&quot; [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].</p><p>The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is &quot;game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes.&quot; [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as &quot;high risk&quot;. [4]</p><p>Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].</p><p>Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.</p><p>Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.</p><p>We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.</p><p>We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more.

I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.</p><p>Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.</p><p>No one says &quot;not my job&quot;, and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year.

As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.</p><p>(Note: &quot;Director&quot; is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)</p><p>The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.</p><p>These roles are primarily remote/work from home, but we try to have them near the customers they support.

Three trends motivated us: First, underserved populations living in our biggest cities have continued to have disproportionately poor health outcomes, with interventions coming much later and at a significantly higher cost than for other populations. Second, nearly all innovation efforts have been focused on people with means, despite urgent need in underserved lower-income communities. And finally, the business of healthcare has become increasingly transactional, leaving little room for meaningful relationships between patients and clinicians, driving increased dissatisfaction among both. We set out to challenge this status quo.\n <br>\n <br>We share the conviction that inequity in health is both unacceptable and solvable. Together, we are re-imagining the future of community health in cities, with a goal of driving health system change at scale.\n <br>\n <br>We're preparing to launch our first Neighborhood Health Hub in early 2018.

We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices.

To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.</p>\n<p>Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.</p>\n<p>We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.</p>\n<p>Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.</p>",

It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the &quot;Usain Bolt of cyber­security&quot; [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].</p>\n<p>The former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is &quot;game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes.&quot; [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as &quot;high risk&quot;. [4]</p>\n<p>Fortune featured us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5], and the Great Place to Work survey put us at #18 in Best Workplaces in the Bay Area [6].</p>\n<p>Benefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, extensive parental leave, fertility and adoption benefits, and more.</p>\n<p>Compensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.</p>\n<p>We get everyone together 4 times a year to keep the remote staff from feeling too remote, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.</p>\n<p>We have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.friedly@[company site].</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Senior Software Engineer - Tanium's Product Engineering is an all-star team with a quality-focused culture. I've never felt like I was the smartest guy in the room here.</p>\n<p>Every PR requires a code review and passing of automated testing before merging, and the ticket is later followed up with a verification to ensure the changes actually met the requirements.</p>\n<p>No one says &quot;not my job&quot;, and depending on what you're doing, you might find yourself writing C++, JavaScript (Node.js, React, AngularJS), Python, Go (golang), or Rust - I did all but one of those within the past year.

As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, ops, programming, and security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.</p>\n<p>(Note: &quot;Director&quot; is indicative of the responsibility level, but Director TAM is not a people-managing role.)</p>\n<p>The organization also has open roles for Customer Success, Solutions Architect, and Enterprise Integration Developer.</p>\n<p>TAM roles are primarily remote/work from home, but we try to have them near the customers they support.

The incumbent vendor has written custom code around Camel which they are prepared to support, but not Camel itself. Zurich has approached us for providing a triaging service for the support Requirement- If a problem is traced back to the core Apache Camel layer (as opposed to the custom code that the vendor has written), it has to be fixed, compiled and deployed in production by Client. Given that the platform is business critical, they are expecting high level of support. The usual support hours are 8 AM to 6 PM GMT, Monday to Friday. The SLAs are likely to be at a Platinum level, given the criticality of the application. I am reproducing the Platinum SLAs below.\n</div>",

Our team is driven to make a difference for the patients we serve. We are leading the transformation of the genetics industry, by making clinical-grade genetic information affordable and accessible to guide health decisions across all stages of life.</p>\n <p>Our team is expanding rapidly and we’re looking for people who are passionate about helping improve healthcare to join us.</p>\n <p>This position is to be the central source of expert information on the company’s products, their use and utility, both internally to the commercial group and externally to patients and physicians, in reproductive genetics and be the authoritative voice within the Medical Affairs team for reproductive and prenatal genetics. Medical Affairs must work assiduously to establish the values and processes needed to support scientific credibility to outside stakeholders. This position sees itself as being responsible for maintaining productive peer-to-peer relationships with KOLs around the world as honest, credible partners in healthcare rather than as biased commercial agents.</p>\n <p>The role emphasizes working with Reproductive Health Genetics Medical Affairs Liaison to organize aspects of medical affairs support for reproductive and prenatal genetic testing including carrier testing, NIPS, prenatal single-gene diagnostic testing, prenatal genomic testing for aneuploidies and aneusomies (by cytogenomic arrays or by NGS cytogenomic methods), and genetic testing for aneuploidies and aneusomies in preimplantation embryos (PGT-A). The Reproductive Genetic Testing Clinical Specialty Lead role requires a deep understanding of current and future clinical trends, standards of care, and client expectations in this arena to advise regarding current product revisions and future development of products including (but not limited t0) genetic evaluation of infertility, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGT-M) and alternative non-invasive methods to PGT-A for assessing health and viability of preimplantation embryos. This role spans both germline and non-invasive maternal genetic testing. Activities include communicating with and educating clients on Invitae’s test offerings in the reproductive genetic space, providing support for the sales and marketing teams, coordinating publications and collaborations with our internal teams and clients, and providing scientific education at conferences and other venues. Client interactions and sales support will be performed in close coordination with Invitae’s Reproductive Medical Affairs Liaison and regional sales managers.</p>\n <p><strong>What you will do:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Working closely with the Clinical Advisory Board, Reproductive Subgroup, to get feedback, solicit ideas for new products, different approaches to reporting results, forging new collaborations, etc.</li>\n  <li>Providing authoritative educational and client support for Invitae’s Reproductive Medical Affairs Liaison, the sales and managed care teams in the area of reproductive genetics.</li>\n  <li>Representing Invitae at reproductive medicine, maternal-fetal medicine and medical genetics conferences by collaboratively preparing abstracts and presenting data.</li>\n  <li>Supporting Invitae’s clinical area directors responsible for building and managing scientific and clinical community relationships and, upon request, helping mediate resolution of client queries.</li>\n  <li>Working with Invitae’s clinical area directors and medical affairs team to help design critical research initiatives, solicit outside collaborators, and define publication and clinical collaboration strategies relevant to Invitae’s entire spectrum of reproductive genetic testing</li>\n  <li>Acting as back-up to Reproductive Medical Affairs Liaison to provide medical affairs support on key messaging in response to clinical clients for queries received via client services, sales, or other groups.</li>\n  <li>Providing input through clinical area directors in all aspects of reproductive genetic testing on commercial priorities related to content prioritization, sales strategies, marketing, and advocacy.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Who you are:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>M.D. with board certification in OB/Gyn as well as in Maternal-Fetal Medicine and/or Clinical Genetics (ABMGG).</strong></li>\n </ul>\n <p>By joining Invitae, you’ll work alongside some of the world’s experts in genetics and healthcare at the forefront of genetic medicine. We’ve created a culture that empowers our teams and our teammates to have the biggest impact and to explore their interests and capabilities. We prize freedom with accountability and&nbsp;<strong>offer significant flexibility,</strong>&nbsp;along with excellent benefits and competitive compensation in a fast-growing organization.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/invitae/jobs/1731907?gh_jid=1731907' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",
