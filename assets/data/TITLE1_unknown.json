The incumbent vendor has written custom code around Camel which they are prepared to support, but not Camel itself. Zurich has approached us for providing a triaging service for the support Requirement- If a problem is traced back to the core Apache Camel layer (as opposed to the custom code that the vendor has written), it has to be fixed, compiled and deployed in production by Client. Given that the platform is business critical, they are expecting high level of support. The usual support hours are 8 AM to 6 PM GMT, Monday to Friday. The SLAs are likely to be at a Platinum level, given the criticality of the application. I am reproducing the Platinum SLAs below.</div>",

    "content": "*Contractor to join an intrapreneurial start-up venture building an employability solution*<br /><br />At Pearson we have a rare opportunity for a driven, entrepreneurial individual who is excited to get the experience of working on an employability start-up, with the unique benefits of innovation coaches and corporate backing by Pearson - the world's leading learning company with global reach and market-leading businesses.  <br /><br />In 2018 a small team of employees from Pearson VUE successfully pitched to receive £200k of seed-stage funding from Pearson’s internal incubator, the Tomorrow’s Markets Incubator (TMI). The Tomorrow’s Markets Incubator is designed to build completely new products, with new business models, that reach new customer markets for Pearson, and deliver social impact through reaching underserved communities.<br /><br />The team have completed comprehensive market research and are in the ‘prototype phase’ of the incubator. They are in the process of taking a concept on paper and turning it into an actual business (the minimum viable venture) that is ready to begin pilot sales. Ventures in the incubator follow a unique ‘venture innovation’ methodology, and the Field Assistant will be expected to learn and effectively apply that methodology in their role, in support of the Venture Director and Field Lead.<br /><br />In addition to direct funding, the Tomorrow’s Markets Incubator provides support to venture teams by way of strategic guidance and hands-on coaching that the Field Assistant will benefit from. <br /><br /><br />*The Role*  <br /><br />The Venture Field Assistant will join a small, dynamic team of employees from Pearson VUE. In this career-enhancing opportunity, it will be your responsibility to:<br /><br />* Assist the Venture Field Lead to conduct desk, academic and in-field customer research with diverse customer demographics and employer organisations. This will include designing the research plan, building research guides, identifying who to interview, executing research to uncover unarticulated pain points and taking detailed notes<br /><br />* Ability to synthesise both quantitative and qualitative research into key findings, to demonstrate an understanding of the market and strategic realities within a corporation and use insight to drive a fully-fledged start-up that is capable of generating significant revenue<br /><br />* Help analyse successes and failures from any testing of the ‘minimum viable venture’ (note: this includes not just testing the product but the marketing, HR support, customer acquisition, etc.)<br /><br />* Build exceptional relationships with internal and external stakeholders (including the Pearson leadership team, the TMI investment committee, potential customers, etc.) <br /><br />* Help with day-to-day project management: scheduling meetings, collating meeting notes, writing regular status reports to the core TMI team, communicating with precision and clarity on the venture’s latest progress and next steps<br /><br />* Track and monitor key performance indicators, including compiling reports as inputs into operational and/or financial modelling activities e.g. researching market wages<br /><br />* Use own initiative to ensure the team stays “on track” to plan, be adaptable to take on a diverse range of tasks, to manage multiple deadlines and deliverable, and to effectively manage own workload in a dynamic and ever changing startup environment (e.g. can work under pressure).<br /><br />You will come with a strong academic background and some professional and/or entrepreneurial experience, perhaps having contributed to start-up businesses in your career, and ideally with good knowledge of the education and/or recruitment industry. <br /><br />We are looking for someone with a strong can-do attitude, great people skills, entrepreneurial spirit, determination to problem solve in an uncertain environment and evolving project definition of success. As the Venture Field Assistant, you will have strong research and analytical skills (both exploratory and evaluative), experience reporting and KPI tracking, an eye for detail, be highly organised and able to independently structure and lead your own work. You will be working in a fast paced, detail oriented and flexible environment and must be open to adapting your knowledge and skills to suit the requirements of the accelerator programme and are comfortable with non-traditional work hours. Think start-up rather than corporate!<br /><br />In return, you will gain hands on experience in all aspects of venture development (e.g. how to build a profitable business), learn a proprietary venture innovation methodology, get exposure to experienced innovation coaches and be part of the team redefining recruitment.<br /><br />You will report to the Venture Field Lead, and work closely with the Venture Director, Tomorrow’s Market Incubator external support team and an experienced venture innovation coach. Key to the success of this position will be working closely with the Venture Field Lead, following directives in a support role, to build a minimum viable venture. <br /><br /><br />*The Opportunity* <br /><br />Venture Field Assistant<br />* Flexible working location (field office and/or home-based)<br />* London/Manchester based with monthly travel opportunities to Manchester/ London <br />* Project expected to last up to 6 months (with potential option for contract renewal) <br />* Pay rate up to £22,500 - £28,000  pro-rata, working full-time hours <br />* Independent contractor<br /><br /><br />*How to Apply*<br /><br />Please complete the answers below and send to Alexandra.Simmons@pearson.com along with a copy of your CV. <br /><br />We are reviewing applications regularly and interviews are being scheduled now, therefore we encourage you to submit your application as soon as possible. Should you have any questions please message Alexandra.<br /><br />Wishing you the very best of success with your application! <br /><br /><br />*Application Questions*<br /><br />1/ What is the biggest challenge with the way employment  / recruitment currently happens today?  <br /><br />2/ What elements are needed to make a venture successful? <br /> <br />3/ Please tell us about a recent project where you have been responsible for completing in-depth research to uncover insights using both consumer research and data analysis. <br />_[We are interested in your approach to problem solving through research, your ability to identify themes, and how you collate and validate ideas]_<br /><br />4/ What other skills or experience do you have, that we did not mention in the job description, but would make you particularly effective at this role?<br /><br />5/ Why are you interested in this role?<br /><br />",

You do the math on that hourly rate.</li><li>You’ll have the freedom of being a freelance writer, like unlimited vacation, work your own hours, work with top-tier clients, eventually getting handed your own top-tier bylines, etc. Except, you won’t have to deal with all the headaches, like email, meetings, client management, billing, self-promotion, and more.</li><li>We’re 100% remote. So it doesn’t matter where you live or what hours you work. Our clients are spread across North America, Europe, and Australia. So we’re set-up to work across time zones, without requiring anyone to virtually punch a clock.</li><li>We always have extra work to go around. And we’ll pay you for content above and beyond your normal capacity. So in addition to the normal pay hikes as you get better (see below), we’ll always have extra work you can take on if you’re interested in working more or overtime.</li></ol><p><b>Why you shouldn’t work with us?</b></p><ol><li>If you’re a ‘writer’ who doesn’t like to write, this position won’t work well for you. The good news is that we’ll strip away all of the other BS that distracts you from writing. Typically, that means full-time writers are putting in a solid 6-8 hours a day (half is usually research, the other half writing). No nights or weekends required (unless that’s when you like doing your thing). However, you’ll still be rolling up your sleeves and putting in some work.</li><li>You’ll write a lot, sure. But to be honest, most of that time should be spent researching. Because there’s a huge difference in writing about truck tires for a generic audience and writing about currency swaps to an audience of savvy, high-net-worth individuals. So you can’t just make $#!^ up. You’ll need to leverage examples, quotes, stats, and screenshots to justify your claims. We’ll show you how to find all of these things, faster and easier, so that your actual time spent writing drops like a rock. Again, you’ll just have to be ready to do the work.</li><li>No, we won’t pay you $500+ per post to start. For a number of reasons, but mostly, you won’t be worth $500+ per post in the early goings. (Harsh, I know.) But we can pay you $5k per month to start if you’re good. And lots more, as you begin mastering client style guides, requiring less oversight from our team of editors. We don’t care if you’re 19 or 59. We want quality and will give you all the work and money available if you can deliver it.</li><li>We’re process-based. That means we have resources and checklists we want you to follow so that you can increase consistency and cut down on the time it takes to create an article. ‘Creatives’ might not like this disciplined approach. But we guarantee your ability to produce high-quality content will skyrocket within the first few months.</li><li>We’re super friendly. We want to support you and do anything possible to help you get better. But we can’t babysit and won’t BS you. If something’s not good, we’ll let you know. Nicely, but firmly. We’re all trying to get better on a daily basis. And that requires constant feedback from other people.</li></ol><p><b>Interested?</b> Please apply here: https://getcodeless.com/writer-investment-economics/</p><p>We’ll get in touch ASAP (today or tomorrow) if you look like a good fit.</p>          </div>          </div>",

We currently have a list of around 2000 companies with some information about each of them. This information includes: website, company name, LinkedIn company profile, and the city and country the headquarters are in. We also have the name of the founder and the contact details for these companies.   <br>   <br>The directory could possibly use an existing WordPress plugin. Here is an example of a similar type of directory: https://saasmag.com/2019-list/.   <br>   <br>The directory will need the following features:   <br>   <br>* The ability for us to add all of the companies we already have.   <br>   <br>* The ability for a company to add themselves.   <br>   <br>* The ability for companies to log in.   <br>   <br>* The ability to email companies a link which will allow them to log in and update their directory listing.   <br>   <br>* A MailChimp signup form embedded on the page.   <br>   <br>* The ability to search the list for a particular company.   <br>   <br>* An admin site to edit entries.   <br>   <br>* The ability to add lists of new companies in the admin site.   <br>   <br>* A list of all of the companies.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>The following fields are to be included on the company profile page:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Company Name   <br>   <br>* Company Description   <br>   <br>* Country   <br>   <br>* Number of Employees   <br>   <br>* Name of the CEO/Founder   <br>   <br>* Position   <br>   <br>* Website Link   <br>   <br>* LinkedIn Company Profile Link   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>TO BE THE BEST MATCH FOR THIS JOB, YOU MUST HAVE EXCELLENT SKILLS IN:   <br>   <br>   <br>* WordPress development (If you will not be using WordPress then PHP is preferred.)   <br>   <br>* Design   <br>   <br>* Project management   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We expect this job to be completed in the following stages:   <br>   <br>Stage 1: Decide what technology to use. (For example, which WordPress plugin). Create the directory design. Receive our approval for the design.   <br>   <br>Stage 2: Create the directory backend and upload it to our servers.   <br>   <br>Stage 3: Upload all of the existing companies to the directory. Create a spreadsheet with a list of all the companies and the link/instructions of how they can update their listings. In this stage, we will do some additional quality assurance for the site to make sure it is working properly.   <br>   <br>Additional Points:   <br>   <br>* The design must look amazing.   <br>   <br>* If we are not happy with Stage 1, we will not continue on to Stage 2.   <br>   <br>* We expect Stage 1 to be very low cost. Most of the cost will be incurred in the creation of the directory (Stage 2).   <br>   <br>  </div> </div>",

Be open minded and hard working enough to be able to fix them.   <br>   <br>* Take constructive criticism;   <br>   <br>* Ask yourself &quot;how to know if I'm wrong?&quot;. You may not, but not challenging your thinking is unhealthy. We challenge each other a lot @Scratchpay.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Our culture   <br>   <br>We care about the human aspect of work and we expect others to. Excellence is also an important keyword @ Scratchpay. While everyone makes mistakes, we learn from them. We are conscious about efficiency and effectiveness in the positive way. We don't do things that bring low-to-no value short or long term. We also do hard things that bring a lot of value. Quality, attention to detail and respect are some of the traits you must have and expect others to have.   <br>   <br>The good   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* We are a team of dedicated, hard working, friendly individuals   <br>   <br>* We move fast, sometimes break things with measure, we give a second chance   <br>   <br>* We give constructive feedback, we challenge each other   <br>   <br>* We are open-minded and we care for each other   <br>   <br>* Everyone is striving towards excellence. Mediocrity isn't our cup of tea. But we always work hard to help those that are willing to get there!   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>The bad   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* Everything goes fast and the ultimate goal is to move the business fast. There can be disconnects in the communication at times. We all need to navigate through this and push whenever it is critical to do so.   <br>   <br>* We are open-minded but things need to be moving forward.   <br>   <br>* We say what we have to. So expect to hear some unpleasant - but true - things sometimes. Don't hesitate to argue back - with respect - if you disagree.   <br>   <br>* Like any startup, It can be a mess some days. You also will likely have to do things that aren't in your scope sometimes. Part of the fun, right? ;)   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>The most important is: We are always looking at improving. All the time, step by step. If you feel mediocre and don't see a path to improvement or can't listen to others' voice to, please do not apply.  </div> </div>",

Adolescence (10-19) is a time of life marked by transition, and is defined by a number of physical and psychological changes that can be both challenging and a time of discovery. In conflict or crisis, young people must somehow ‘cross over’ from childhood to adulthood without the safety, security and opportunities normally afforded to them. Further, humanitarian assistance has typically overlooked adolescents. Mercy Corps’ goal is to work with adolescents in these settings so that they are&nbsp;<em>Future Proof</em>, meaning they are mobilized to contribute to their communities today, ready for what comes their way in the future, can confront obstacles with resilience and resolve, and feel valued by their families, communities, and society. We seek to intentionally integrate adolescents as a central target population in our humanitarian response, engaging adolescents from relief to early recovery programming.</p><p>During emergencies Mercy Corps’ response often start with water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), cash based transfers (Cash), and food security and nutrition (Food Security). These sectors are consider the “areas of excellence” that Mercy Corps plans to advance technically while meeting global best practice, and ensuring strong systems to measure impact. This includes meeting the needs of adolescents and ensuring safe and meaningful participation in humanitarian response. By integrating a focus on adolescents at the initial stages of a crisis we aim to reduce the use of negative coping strategies that put adolescent girls and boys at risk. Through engaging with adolescents and their support networks, we are also able to explore innovative ways to accelerate recovery, and transition programming with adolescents to explore the development of relevant knowledge and skills, as well as meaningful opportunities for civic and economic engagement.</p><p><strong>Purpose / Project Description:</strong></p><p>The purpose of this project is to help advance Mercy Corps’ responsiveness to the needs of adolescent boys and girls at the onset of a crisis. The project will develop actionable information based on promising practices for supporting and partnering with adolescents through emergency WASH, Cash, and Food Security programming. The information is expected to provide concrete guidance to team members in WASH, Cash, and Food Security to incorporate the needs and strengths of adolescent girls and boys when implementing emergency response programming.</p><p>The consultant will review literature on emergency response in WASH, Cash, Food Security &amp; Nutrition, Child Protection (with a focus on girls and boys aged 10-19 years), GBV, and Gender to compile best practices and approaches to inform intentional adolescent programming in Mercy Corps’ emergency response “areas of excellence”. As a result of adolescents traditionally being underserved within emergency response programming, there may be a lack of specific guidance and therefore a need for the consultant to craft best practices by adapting tested approaches that use age, gender and protection factors to inform WASH, Cash and Food Security activities. This includes attention to strategies for working with the most hard-to-reach adolescent girls and boys; and encouraging their direct participation to promote the development of safe environments for adolescents.</p><p><strong>Consultant Objectives:</strong></p><ol><li>A list of best practices in WASH, Cash Based Transfers, and Food Security that support adolescent girls and boys at the onset of emergency response is compiled. Filter using an age (10-14 yrs and 15-19 yrs) gender, and protection lens.</li><li>Best practices are drafted into easy-to-read guidance documents targeting teams in each area of excellence – WASH, Cash, and Food Security. They are unpacked and organized to address specific issues that adolescent boys and girls face during the onset of crisis related to each Mercy Corps “areas of excellence”.</li><li>Sound quality assurance of best practices through consultation with WASH, Cash, Food Security, Adolescent, Protection and Gender Advisors and specialists.</li></ol><p><strong>Consultant Activities:</strong></p><p><strong>The Consultant will:</strong></p><ol><li>Consult with technical advisors of WASH, Cash, Food Security, Adolescent, Protection and Gender to identify reference material.</li><li>Assess key areas of concern among select field staff and advisors concerning adolescent girls and adolescent boys in WASH, Cash Based Transfers, and Food Security.</li><li>Based on consultations in Activity 1, determine sequence of guidance documents by “area of excellence”.</li><li>Literature review of global best practices that highlight intentional support to adolescent girls and adolescent boys in the emergency response of WASH, Cash, and Food Security (i.e. Areas of Excellence).

Ballot Scout helps election administrators track absentee ballots through the mail, providing transparency in the vote-by-mail process and making it easier to follow up when things go awry. And in 2018, we became the organizational home of the National Association of State Election Directors (NASED).</p><p><strong>Software Development at Democracy Works</strong></p><p>These products are the work of our 14-developer team. Most of our development involves writing microservices in Clojure running in Docker containers on Kubernetes and hosted on AWS.

We also have projects that use JavaScript, Node, React, Python, and PostgreSQL.</p><p>We pair program, collaborate with product managers, and make sure our efforts deliver value to voters.

Works for you, doesn’t it? If so, you’re probably someone who regularly earns the most valuable player award on any team, club, or company you’ve ever worked for. If this sounds like you – someone who enjoys managing projects or initiatives from start to finish with a lot of moving parts – we hope you will take a look at our <strong>Grants Coordinator</strong> position – especially if development or account management are on your career path.</p><p>We are looking for someone who cares deeply about the pressing issues facing our planet and who views advancing Friends of the Earth’s case for funding as your mission. We want someone who is willing to do what it takes to get the job done. The role can be remote. We have offices in DC and in the Bay Area.</p><p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p><p><strong>Friends of the Earth </strong>is working for a healthier and more just world. We understand that the challenges facing our planet call for more than half measures, so we push for the reforms that are needed, not merely the ones that are politically easy. Our mission is to change the perception of the public, media and policy makers — and effect policy change — with impactful, well-reasoned policy analysis and advocacy campaigns that truly protect people and the planet. This hard-hitting advocacy has been the key to our successful campaigns over our four-plus decades in operation. Our programs address a wide range of domestic and international issues as they relate to the environment, including but not limited to: climate and energy, food and agriculture, oceans and water, economic policy and democracy reform.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p><p>You will be joining a development team that has achieved record success. Most of the growth in revenue, however, has been in our major donor, email and mail operations. The Grant portfolio is strong at approximately $2M per year. But it hasn’t yet achieved the same pace of growth as other channels. That is why we are investing in our grant program by hiring you! We have a skilled grant writer who is focused on making sure we are sending out only the highest quality content to funders. Your job will be to make sure our grant fundraising operation runs like a well-oiled, finely tuned machine. Here are the broad areas of responsibility, as well as a sampling of the juicy tasks you’ll be tackling on your first day:</p><p><strong><em>Manage our grant-seeking process: </em></strong>You will own the entire grants pipeline from helping to identify funders to receiving the checks! At the end of the day, it’s your job to be an advocate for our funders, ensuring that our proposals and documentation meet all their expectations.</p><ul><li>Build, expand, and maintain an internal calendar of grant proposal and report deadlines.</li><li>Develop and distribute a production timeline to all involved project staff to ensure timely submission by deadlines.</li><li>Track each step of assignments and coordinate directly with staff to ensure deadlines are met.</li><li>Collect all components of each grant submission, ensuring that the proposal is formatted, packaged, and submitted in accordance with funders’ requirements.</li><li>Produce components not assigned to other project participants.</li><li>Advise and assist in the design and formatting of grant proposal and report documentation.</li><li>Communicate with foundations administrative staff regarding grant submission and follow-up.</li><li>Quality control – make sure all the details meet funders expectations.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Identify prospects and manage our communications with them: </em></strong>You will be mining databases for prospects, entering them into our prospect database, arranging for impactful communications to be forwarded to interested parties. You are pleased when you are able to find a nugget of data or information that someone else might have missed and are able to share that with the team.</p><ul><li>Maintain your individual and our collective knowledge of grant-making policies and procedures.</li><li>Keep your finger on the pulse of foundation opportunities.</li><li>Mine our foundation data to determine missed and potential opportunities.</li><li>Connect the dots for other FOE team members that will make our proposals exceptional and win praise from our funders.</li></ul><p><strong><em>Track and report on progress towards goals:</em></strong> You own our prospect database and consider keeping it up one of the most important parts of your job. Plus, you love keeping score so maintaining records is second nature to you. It allows you to see patterns in your work and make improvements.</p><ul><li>Oversee foundation prospect database, tracking communications and next steps in cultivation.</li><li>Document submissions, conversations with funders, and next steps.</li><li>Maintain up-to-date folders for reference documentation and previous grant proposals for us in the drafting of new proposals.</li><li>Provide the VP of Membership and Development reports for use at FOE board meetings.</li><li>Identify and report on gaps and ways to systems.</li></ul><p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p><p><strong>Who You Are</strong></p><p>First of all, if you are not currently working in a nonprofit, that is fine. If you are in a sales or proposal coordination position in corporate, please consider yourself welcome to apply. And, if you are in a nonprofit, great. Regardless of where you come from, a commitment to our mission and the progressive movement is critical.</p><p><strong>Experience Required:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Bachelor’s or experience</strong></li><li>3 years of professional work experience</li><li>Nonprofit experience preferred, but sales or proposal support work in the private sector valuable</li></ul><p><strong>To be successful in this job, you are exceptional in these five areas:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Project management </strong>– You stay on top of multiple projects without dropping any balls and meet deadlines for multiple projects at once. You plan with the end goal in mind and work backwards, anticipating obstacles, involving stakeholders appropriately, and using resources wisely. You are not afraid to ask for help when you need it.</li><li><strong>Customer service orientation </strong>– You take initiative to solve problems, but your real strength is proactively improving the efficiency of our grants operation and preventing problems. You not only do your own work well, but your natural inclination is to reach out to others and offer support to move a project to completion. You know how to get what we need to be successful without damaging relationships.</li><li><strong>Communication </strong>– You lean into conversations, but don’t have to be the center of attention. You seize concepts and ideas easily and are able to accurately put this understanding into action. You are assertive when you need to be and a clear communicator in both verbal and written communications.</li><li><strong>Attention to detail </strong>– You have an exceptional eye for accuracy around process – workflows, deliverables, original content, and deadlines — and able to ensure all content is packaged correctly and on time.</li><li><strong>Organization</strong> – You have always been organized and use a variety of personal systems and technology tools to ensure that you are always delivering what is needed in the time frame required. You are very comfortable with the Microsoft Office Suite – Word, Excel, PowerPoint</li></ul><p><strong>What Else You Should Know</strong></p><p>We are a culture of can-do people, working in open spaces, regularly supporting each other. You can work remote. Your salary will be competitive for the role and market and you will find our benefits to be generous – organization-sponsored medical/dental/vision care, generous paid time off, contribution to retirement, flexible spending accounts, commuter benefits, paid maternity/paternity leave and more.</p><p>But above all, you have a passion for the environment and progressive politics . . . and it shows through. If this sounds like you, please forward your resume to our recruiter and let’s get started!</p><p><em>We are an equal opportunity employer who encourages applications from women, people of color and other members of underrepresented groups who will contribute to the diversity of its staff. Also, please note that references will be requested during the screening process and we will ask final candidates to tackle some exercises that directly relate to the job description.</em></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://foe.org/grants-coordinator/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
