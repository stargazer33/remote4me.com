You will engage, enroll and coordinate care to improve health and quality of life for members of this program, helping them comply with treatment plans, take advantage of available resources, and more. All work is done over the phone, so you can&nbsp;work from the comfort of your&nbsp;<em>home office</em>&nbsp;and enjoy a good deal of&nbsp;autonomy. We’re looking for sharp, creative professionals who are motivated to use their brainpower in a pioneering health management framework. While we are still young as a company, our&nbsp;successful approach has earned us contracts with major health plans&nbsp;and allowed us to expand rapidly. That growth will create opportunities for strong performers.</p><p>We have multiple opportunities for Care Coaches across the country, so feel free to share this information within your network.</p><p>Catasys is making a positive impact on people’s lives every day. We use predictive analytics to identify health plan members with unaddressed behavioral health conditions that worsen chronic disease, then engage, support and guide these members to better health with a personalized, human-centered approach. This has led us to where we are today: growing fast and saving lives as we do.</p><p>To support our explosive growth, we’re looking for compassionate, hard-working people-lovers to join our team. If innovating in the<em>&nbsp;field&nbsp;</em>of patient care is something you’re passionate about, we encourage you to join our mission to improve the health and save the lives of as many people as possible.</p><p><strong>The Requirements</strong></p><p>To meet the basic qualifications for this role you will have legal authorization to work permanently in the United States for any employer without requiring a visa transfer or visa sponsorship.

You’ll need a<em>&nbsp;</em><strong>home office&nbsp;</strong>space free from distraction, a high-speed Internet connectivity that delivers download speeds of at least 10 MBPS and upload speeds of at least 5 MBPS, and the ability to hardwire the VoIP phone to your router.</p><p>You’ll work Monday through Friday from 12 PM to 9 PM Eastern.</p><p><strong>Pivotal Role in Innovative Program</strong></p><p>You will assume responsibility for engagement, enrollment, retention and coordination of care to improve the health and quality of life for our members.

But we&rsquo;re also a team of dedicated (self-proclaimed) nerds, tech is what we know and love. So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]</p><p>Job positions:</p><p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)</p><p>- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.</p><p>- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.</p><p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.</p><p>- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)</p><p>- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc</p><p>Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 3months.</p><p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com</p><p>PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.</p><p>PS II: In case you're only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important).</p>",

We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.</p><p>We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices.

We're planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.</p><p>Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.</p><p>We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.</p><p>Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.</p>",

What&rsquo;s shocking is almost all of this is avoidable, 80-90% in fact.</p><br /><p>How? Through sustained lifestyle and weight loss. It sounds so simple, but in reality is much harder to achieve at&nbsp;scale.</p><br /><h2>2&nbsp;OurPath</h2><br /><p>OurPath provide&nbsp;a digital lifestyle improvement programme that is proven to help people improve their lifestyle and lose weight, which ultimately reduces their risk for conditions such as type 2 diabetes.</p><br /><p>The programme incorporates evidence-based education, health coaches, peer group support, and digital tracking tools. Everything is delivered digitally through phone and web apps.</p><br /><p>We were the first digital behavioural change programme to be commissioned by the NHS &ndash; we&rsquo;re now expanding rapidly having won a few big national contracts (both in diabetes prevention and management).</p><br /><p>Alongside our NHS work, we also offer the programme directly to consumers &ndash; you can buy the programme on our website if you&rsquo;re looking to make a healthy lifestyle change and lose weight. Our direct-to-consumer channel is essentially a competitor to the likes of Weight Watchers and Slimming World.</p><br /><p>About us: We are now a team of 50 &ndash; consisting of ex-strategy consultants, dietitians, designers, and developers. We believe OurPath is a fun place to work with an informal, non-bureaucratic, and agile working environment. Finally, we will provide endless amounts of poor jokes and sub-standard humour. Just so you know.</p><br /><p>Some of our national press:</p><br /><p><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/ourpath-raises-3m-in-round-led-by-connect-ventures-to-reverse-type-2-diabetes/'>TechCrunch</a></p><br /><p><a href='http://www.wired.co.uk/article/ourpath-diabetes-app-roche-nhs-partnership'>Wired</a></p><br /><h2><strong>3 The Position</strong></h2><br /><p>As we continually expand the company, we&rsquo;re now looking to hire an Office Manager to help support our fast-growing team, manage the office environment, and assist with maintaining our accounts. This exciting role would primarily entail:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Ensuring that the office is a pleasant and safe space to work in</li><br /><li>Ordering groceries, stationary, equipment, and furnishings</li><br /><li>Finding a new office space for our growing team to move into (super fun!)</li><br /><li>Liaising with building management, facilities, cleaners, and repairmen</li><br /><li>Planning events, conferences, parties and socials</li><br /><li>Processing team expenses</li><br /><li>Paying bills and maintaining a tidy record of invoices</li><br /><li>Assisting team members and our company founders with ad-hoc tasks</li><br /></ul><br /><p>One of the advantages of the Office Manager position at OurPath is that almost every day is different, so the role will keep you on your toes in dealing with a wide range of activities.&nbsp;</p><br /><h2><strong>4 Person Specification&nbsp;</strong></h2><br /><p>The team assistant position will be a heavily task-orientated role. Therefore, our ideal candidate must:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Have 2 years of experience as either an office manager or admin/team/personal assistant</li><br /><li>Really thrive on getting a lot of things done, and this is an energy provider for them (rather than an energy depleter)</li><br /><li>Be particularly efficient, agile, know how to prioritise, and able to see what jobs need to be done without being asked</li><br /><li>Demonstrate excellent attention to detail and be meticulous about their work (essential for looking after our financial admin)</li><br /><li>Be confident and able to speak up to the team (especially when they need to be told to wash their dishes!)</li><br /></ul><br /><h2><strong>5 What can we offer you?</strong></h2><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>An exciting job</strong>&nbsp;at one of the first digital behavioural change programmes ever commissioned by the NHS</li><br /><li><strong>Exposure</strong>&nbsp;to lots of different elements of the development of an early stage healthcare startup</li><br /><li><strong>You&rsquo;ll have autonomy&nbsp;and responsibility</strong>&nbsp;for your work direction; we also offer a flexible working environment where you can work from home when you need to</li><br /><li><strong>Opportunity to provide direct input</strong>&nbsp;into the development of OurPath and the shape of our office environment in the near future</li><br /><li><strong>You&rsquo;ll get to work with&nbsp;amazing, friendly, smart colleagues&nbsp;</strong>all incredibly passionate about solving the type 2 diabetes epidemic</li><br /><li><strong>We have regular company-sponsored socials</strong>&nbsp;(pub drinks, team lunches, board games and movie nights) that&rsquo;ll allow you to make friends with everyone on the team</li><br /><li><strong>We all have a thirst for knowledge</strong>&nbsp;and have regular Lunch &amp; Learn sessions to help us expand our knowledge base</li><br /></ul><br /><h2>6&nbsp;To Apply</h2><br /><p>This position is available to start immediately, so please send your CV and cover letter to stella@ourpath.co.uk</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;ll be interviewing on a rolling basis, so the quicker you can apply&nbsp;the better.</p><br /><p>If Stella doesn&rsquo;t respond within 7 days then she&rsquo;s not intentionally being rude but please assume it&rsquo;s probably a no for now.</p><br /><p>In the meantime, you can check out our lovely faces&nbsp;<a href='https://www.ourpath.co.uk/about-us'>here</a>.</p>",

We connect people with health needs to companies who can help them.</p><p>That means we run online ads to find people in need of medical procedures or treatment, they ask for help or more information, and then we call them to convince them to take action and schedule and attend an appointment with one of our partner doctors.</p><p>Right now we need a few more folks to help with those calls.That’s where you come in.</p><p><strong>What’s your role in all this?</strong></p><p>We are expanding our outreach team as our clients continue to grow. No, it’s not cold calling, but there is persuasion involved. The people our outreach team calls have requested information and typically want their health problem solved. This is a medical sales position.</p><p><strong>So, who is our company?</strong></p><p>We are 83bar. Yes, that’s our name. 83bar is the maximum amount of pressure a fire hose can put out, which describes what we do well for our clients. We work hard to make sure our clients can help as many people as possible. We’re a company that believes in “doing well while doing good.”</p><p><strong>What makes us unique?</strong></p><p>A few things. We work with cutting edge healthcare companies, which is always fun, and we’re a virtual company. We have employees in Texas, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, Florida and many other states. We work online and enjoy what we do, but without the stuffy office.</p><p>Currently Hiring for part time positions – and we are looking applicants available to&nbsp;<strong>work shifts between 7am and 10 pm CST.</strong>&nbsp;If you do well, full time could become an option.</p><p>We’ve custom built a system that lets you log in do your job wherever you want to. You just need access to high speed Internet.</p><p>If you are smart, detail-oriented, don’t mind calling people, and have availability, you might be a fit for us.</p><p>One key benefit we offer our clients is medically trained outreach clinical specialists. We have found that nurses have both the clinical knowledge and the empathy required to successfully connect with the people we are reaching out to help, and educate them about the life-changing services our clients have to offer.</p><p>Bonus points if you’ve done outbound calling before, have worked with CRMs, or have previous sales experience.</p><p>We need applicants who are willing to become experts in our clients’ services and the disease processes that they treat. In addition, we are looking for people who are skilled at connecting with patients and convincing them to take the next step to get their health problems solved. The key to success in this position is the ability to persuade people to take action, and overcome their skepticism in trying something new.</p><p>Our outreach team is responding immediately when a new consumer reaches out to us. We make it easy for you to “punch in” and “punch out”, but&nbsp;<strong>if your schedule is too hectic and you can’t dedicate a consistent 20 hours a week, please do not apply.</strong></p><p><strong>Details about the position</strong></p><p>Pay: $30/hour (paid bi-weekly with direct deposit)</p><p>Schedule: Because consumers reach out to us at all hours, we’re staffing for many different time frames and would like to hear from you when you are available.<strong>&nbsp;This position is part-time, but it does require a commitment to a consistent schedule where you will be logged in and working in our system. (The minimum commitment is 20 hours a week. Full time is an option depending on experience.)</strong></p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p><strong>We work remotely and you don’t have to drive to work!</strong></p><p><strong>About our clients</strong></p><p>As you have probably figured out, our clients aren’t your typical healthcare companies like a hospital or insurance provider. Instead, we work with creative, relatively new companies with innovative solutions trying to help people solve their health issues in new ways. These new companies need awareness and that’s where we come in. We use cutting-edge lead generation and sales automation to help consumers find our clients.</p><p><strong>Here are a few examples of folks we work with:</strong></p><ul><li>A DNA lab testing company that helps people discover if they are at risk of hereditary cancers.</li><li>A services company that treats people with prediabetes and prevents them from developing Type II diabetes. One-third of adults have prediabetes!</li><li>A medical device company that helps women who have been struggling with bladder control for years.</li><li>Too many to list them all here.</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Experienced, Licensed Nurse (RNs )</li><li>Experience in Sales</li><li>Customer Service Experience</li><li>Detail Oriented</li><li>Ability to Commit to a Set Weekly Schedule</li></ul><p>To apply: Please complete the application and respond with a short paragraph or two on why you think you’re a fit. Please attach your resume and also add in what experience you’ve had (if any) working with a virtual company, in sales, on the phone, and in health care.</p><p>Once you have completed the above step please click on the link below and complete our pre-test. This is MANDATORY and we will not be able to schedule any interviews or consider you if this pre-test is not completed.</p><p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYdZhxQl7PARpnnNbKKA4E7ohP3xFuTbSRIsUh62bVCxGAfg/viewform</p><p>Please do NOT call our office to inquire about the role or ask about your application status. We receive a high volume of applications and are unable to return calls. Complete all the steps outlined, and if we think you are a good fit, we will contact you.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p>$30/hour</p><p><strong>Work from home.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://83bar.workable.com/jobs/1059724' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Your intelligence and talent are not fixed; they're developed over time through perseverance, dedication, and hard work.</li><li>Calm the Chaos: Urgency leads to errors; frenzy to frustration. We focus on developing the steady working rhythm and calm mind that works best for solving complex problems.</li><li>Communication is Just as Important as Code: No one at Corgibytes identifies themselves as a “technical” or “non-technical” because everyone is both. Practice both types of skills regularly.</li><li>Craft in Context: Match your solution to the situation. Sometimes it’s a quick and dirty prototype to prove a concept. When the stakes are high, spending extra time getting it right is the best way to go.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Does that sound like you? Awesome! We live these values every day, and they’re a guide in making decisions, no matter how small. They’ve helped us develop a culture where folks are autonomous, responsible, and work hard without feeling burned out or like they have to choose between family and work. We’re the type of company where it’s common to see a toddler bouncing on a knee during a meeting. As an intentionally distributed team, we focus more on results than micromanagement. Our core values are key to our culture, as are our pillars of autonomy, balance, diversity, and trust.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re interested in this type of position -- if you enjoy managing details, keeping people accountable, rolling up your sleeves to just get the job done -- but don’t quite have the experience, try anyway. Many skills are transferable.</div><div><br>Click <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdzA9x3Qv90sNhk2JpSY8MHcTRpew84PREwDnA-EPvrfKkwHg/viewform' rel='nofollow'>here</a> to apply.</div></div>",
