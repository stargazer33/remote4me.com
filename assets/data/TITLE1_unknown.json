    "content": "<p>Hi, my name is Anton - one of the founders of Zipkin Real Estate. We are working with world&rsquo;s most prestigious and demanding property market - London.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Two things put us in front of the competition and make clients want to work with us - <em>novelty</em> and <em>quality</em>. That means we invest in latest technologies to offer our clients maximum convenience at an unprecedented level of quality.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We entered the market with goal to avoid the burden that classic real estate agencies are carrying. We are not driven by inertia and old ways, instead we closely follow the market and keep ourselves aligned with the needs of our clients. We have streamlined our model to allow us carefully listen market trends and follow them without having to re-train or re-design any of our processes.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our light-weight model is coated with our signature customer service. Each client is served in a way that works best for him - that means viewings after hours and on weekends; that means holding conversation on platform of client&rsquo;s choice; that means negotiating best terms even without being asked to do so. You get the idea - <em>fighting in the corner of our client</em>. We work in high-end segment and our clients are successful people who excel in what they do and they always spot the difference. And once they do, they genuinely want to work with us.<span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;>&nbsp;</span></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our team is just as important to us. That&rsquo;s why we play it fair and use common sense and require everyone in the team to do the same. No office politics or other mumbo-jumbo. We don&rsquo;t pay flat fees to our agents, but offer signing bonus to support while agent&rsquo;s pipeline is filling up. We are volume driven business and offer fair 15% of each deal, payable same day as money hit company&rsquo;s account, no deductions. Any agent in this position can easily expect to take home anywhere between &pound;10.000 and &pound;15.000/month and we don&rsquo;t put any caps.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We don&rsquo;t want our agents spending time cold calling through old lists. We ensure our agents get fresh high quality leads to work with, this is made possible through our partnership with digital industry leaders and our heavy investment in marketing. We give agents ground for success and in return we require our agents to have strong market expertise and entrepreneurial mindset. We don&rsquo;t offer training and expect our agents to start right off the bat. That&rsquo;s why we only look for experienced agents with successful track-record in London.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our customer coverage will span across Middle East, Asia, Europe and UK. Each segment will be gradually taken on, starting with London and that&rsquo;s why we are looking for <strong>Head of London desk</strong> who will be spearheading our London sales and development. At first, this position will be predominantly sales oriented, however, as we ramp-up the volume, we will be hiring more London agents reportable into this position. This is an opportunity to be in the front row and actually drive new company.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Your output:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>London new-build flat or house sold to a client and our company gets a fair fee for the deal.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Your responsibility:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Timely processing of the incoming leads in line with company&rsquo;s standards and reflecting your progress in CRM.</li><br /><li>Preparing selection of options for prospective clients to help them narrow the search. Swift communication with developers to collate real-time snapshot of available plots and presenting information to the clients.</li><br /><li>Viewings logistics management on behalf of the client.</li><br /><li>Full ownership of the deal until developer transfers the fee into company&rsquo;s account.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Working with ZipKin will suit you if:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have experience living and selling real estate in London in medium and high-end price range.</li><br /><li>You feel you are meant to do more and will not shy away from responsibility in running this business.</li><br /><li>You feel uplifted by delivering work on an exceptional level of quality.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Terms:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>We don&rsquo;t pay flat fees, but offer &pound;3.000 signing bonus to support you while your pipeline is filling up. We offer you 15% of each deal, payable same day as money hit company&rsquo;s account, no deductions.<span class=&quot;Apple-converted-space&quot;>&nbsp;</span></li><br /><li>3 month contract with option to switch to employment after.</li><br /><li>Flexible working hours as long as it works for your clients - you will be setting the hours and your results will be the judge.</li><br /><li>We provide strong stream of fresh and high-quality leads landing straight into convenient CRM system. You are not expected to generate leads yourself.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Extras:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>We don&rsquo;t cap your income - seasoned agents can expect to get &pound;15.000-25.000/month and our terms remain fixed on any levels.</li><br /><li>This is a new business with a lot of milestones yet to be hit.

Tables, margins, weird indentations and other print related tricks are your jam, and nothing in Word really scares you unless were talking about that time you thought you were Word; in which case you might be our kind of weird, keep reading.</li><li>Love Logic Problems&nbsp;— You love logic. If this, then that? A huge plus if you ever done some light programming or aspire to learn more. Looking at computer syntaxes and code doesn’t scare you — no, for you that’s a warm feeling right there.</li><li>Attention to Detail&nbsp;— it drives you crazy when things arent right, out of place or the formatting is janky (hey, thats a technical term!)</li><li>Self Starting, Strong Communicator&nbsp;— we are a fully remote team and expect everyone on the team to have great communication skills. Youll be relied upon to deliver on a really important part of the product which will require team collaboration.</li><li>Desire to Learn&nbsp;— Well be teaching you WebMerge, JSON, version control and some development skills. If you have any of this coming in the door, that’s a plus, let us know!</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p>~$30/hr, we expect this to be a part-time gig to start.

Our vision is to establish a project at the heart of the community, producing exceptional spirits using the great raw ingredients (Chalk filtered water off the plain, barley grown in the field by the distillery site) to produce world class spirits (including alcohol free) to meet the changing needs of our consumers while creating products Wiltshire can be proud of!</p><br /><p>At this stage we are looking to build the brand out to support the business plan and in turn secure funding for the distillery. The branding will be key to setting off on the right foot and establishing a sound base from which to grow and develop.</p><br /><p>The role/deliverables:</p><br /><div class=&quot;s3&quot;>1. Support development of overall start up strategy &ndash; principles/mission</div><br /><div class=&quot;s3&quot;>2. Review market segments, covering areas of growth/contraction and predicted trends. (Slide pack)</div><br /><div class=&quot;s3&quot;>3. Consider target groups, identify different customer profiles (Slide pack)</div><br /><div class=&quot;s3&quot;>4. Develop initial messaging</div><br /><div class=&quot;s3&quot;>5. Develop brand position (Slide pack, paper &ndash; to support BP)</div><br /><div class=&quot;s3&quot;>6. Develop logo, tag line (slide pack)</div><br /><p>Experience (Preferred but not essential):</p><br /><div class=&quot;s3&quot;>1. Alcoholic beverages (Spirits)</div><br /><div class=&quot;s3&quot;>2. Premium Soft drinks</div><br /><div class=&quot;s3&quot;>3. Premium product development</div><br /><div class=&quot;s3&quot;>4. Wiltshire / South West based</div><br /><p class=&quot;s4&quot;>This is a voluntary position as we don't currently have funding (so would suit someone on furlough with a passion for distilling and some spare time!). We'd hope to be able to repay you with some of our end product down the line, as well as references and potentially future paid work if everything goes to plan. Plus, we think we're an alright bunch of people to work on a project with, so hopefully a positive distraction if you're looking for one!</p><br /><p class=&quot;s5&quot;><a name=&quot;_GoBack&quot;></a><span class=&quot;s2&quot;>Hours</span>: Remote to suit. we imagine this will need a few days of effort, would probably require a couple of hours a day for a week or so. Obviously, we're flexible on timing and can work around you, but if you're looking for full-time work this probably isn't the project for you</p>",
