You would be the first person in this area of the business, and we’d want you to wear multiple hats: accounting, financial planning, board reporting, etc. At first, we need you to roll up your sleeves and get things done, but as the company grows we’ll want you to help us grow the finance function into a best-in-class team.</p><p><strong>Who we are</strong></p><p>At Fishtown Analytics, we have developed strong opinions on how companies should practice analytics.</p><p><strong>Specifically, we believe that:</strong></p><ul><li>Code, not graphical user interfaces, is the best abstraction to express complex analytic logic</li><li>Data analysts should adopt similar practices and tools to software developers</li><li>Critical analytics infrastructure should be controlled by its users as open source software</li><li>Analytic code itself—not just analytics tools—will increasingly be open source</li></ul><p>It turns out that a lot of other people believe this too! Over the course of the past several years we’ve built a community of 5,000+ people and 1,700 companies who are using our ideas, products, and workflows to conduct analytics, including Lyft, Monzo, GitLab, Snowflake, the ACLU, Amazon, JetBlue, and RentTheRunway. Our product, dbt, has come to be synonymous with the practice of analytics engineering, defining an entire industry.</p><p>We’re on a mission to empower analysts to create and disseminate organizational knowledge.

Experience in venture-backed companies is a must. Experience in a SaaS environment is a plus.</li><li>Have a CPA or a graduate degree in accounting.</li><li>Have led teams before; have both hired and fired.
