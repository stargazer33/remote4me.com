When your parent is diagnosed with Parkinson's, you realize with clarity that life is short. You realize that your most important memories are just sitting in your fallible mind. Our memories are one of our most important possessions, yet we don't use a dedicated tool to help us relive our family's love.</p><p>In the future, you'll have your precious memories at your fingertips. Whenever you need them, wherever you are, stored securely forever. We'll share these memories with the people closest to us &amp; keep these precious memories within quick reach for us personally. We'll take a few minutes here and there to reminisce through our memories. Escape. Relive our family's love: our children's laughter, our spouse's wedding day smile, our parent's &quot;it'll be okay&quot;. It will all be there, in one spot: deep &amp; meaningful.</p><p>To bring this to reality we need to do a few things: We need to make collecting memories fun, make curating delightful with collaboration, &amp; build magical relive experiences. We're building a platform that starts by focusing on Millennial parents, with the intention of bringing along the Gen X grandparents for the social network Facebook should have been: a private family room instead of a public town square. Focused on love &amp; family, not memes &amp; politics.</p><p>About the Role</p><p>We're looking for our 1st hire, a designer to help us set our design foundation. We're a team of 3 (engineering, iOS, &amp; product).</p><p>Role Requirements:</p><p>- Beautiful modern design sense</p><p>- Positive attitude</p><p>- Growth mindset</p><p>- Loves working remote</p><p>Ideal Candidate:</p><p>- Mother</p><p>- Willing to help in other areas of the business</p><p>- Illustration animation experience</p><p>- Sketch experience</p><p>This project is being worked on by experienced startup founders (2 startups: 1st acquired, 2nd funded $20m).</p><p>Send me a note with [HN] in the subject line to chad@trypersona.com</p>",

We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices.

However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.</p><p>We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.</p><p>Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.</p>",

We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result.</p><p>We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.</p><p>We're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.</p><p>We recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We're planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry. To do that, we're looking to bring on more exceptionally talented engineers. Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.</p><p>Our tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.</p><p>We're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.</p><p>Email us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.</p>",

    "content": "[still-unnamed startup in stealth mode] | REMOTE or ONSITE(around HK: Guangzhou,Macau,Shenzhen,Taiwan,etc) | 20-40h per week, freelancers/full-timers/part-timers<p>Sorry for the vague description but I can tell you more about the product we're building when you apply. Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]</p><p>Job positions:</p><p>- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well.)</p><p>- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.</p><p>- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.</p><p>- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.</p><p>- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of &quot;Electron apps&quot;, because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)</p><p>- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc</p><p>Important perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 3months.</p><p>Write me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com</p><p>PS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.</p><p>PS II: In case you're only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important).</p>",

But we&rsquo;re also a team of dedicated (self-proclaimed) nerds, tech is what we know and love. So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

We work online and enjoy what we do, but without the stuffy office.</p><p>Currently Hiring for part time positions – and we are looking applicants available to&nbsp;<strong>work shifts between 7am and 10 pm CST.</strong>&nbsp;If you do well, full time could become an option.</p><p>We’ve custom built a system that lets you log in do your job wherever you want to. You just need access to high speed Internet.</p><p>If you are smart, detail-oriented, don’t mind calling people, and have availability, you might be a fit for us.</p><p>One key benefit we offer our clients is medically trained outreach clinical specialists. We have found that nurses have both the clinical knowledge and the empathy required to successfully connect with the people we are reaching out to help, and educate them about the life-changing services our clients have to offer.</p><p>Bonus points if you’ve done outbound calling before, have worked with CRMs, or have previous sales experience.</p><p>We need applicants who are willing to become experts in our clients’ services and the disease processes that they treat. In addition, we are looking for people who are skilled at connecting with patients and convincing them to take the next step to get their health problems solved. The key to success in this position is the ability to persuade people to take action, and overcome their skepticism in trying something new.</p><p>Our outreach team is responding immediately when a new consumer reaches out to us. We make it easy for you to “punch in” and “punch out”, but&nbsp;<strong>if your schedule is too hectic and you can’t dedicate a consistent 20 hours a week, please do not apply.</strong></p><p><strong>Details about the position</strong></p><p>Pay: $30/hour (paid bi-weekly with direct deposit)</p><p>Schedule: Because consumers reach out to us at all hours, we’re staffing for many different time frames and would like to hear from you when you are available.<strong>&nbsp;This position is part-time, but it does require a commitment to a consistent schedule where you will be logged in and working in our system. (The minimum commitment is 20 hours a week. Full time is an option depending on experience.)</strong></p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p><strong>We work remotely and you don’t have to drive to work!</strong></p><p><strong>About our clients</strong></p><p>As you have probably figured out, our clients aren’t your typical healthcare companies like a hospital or insurance provider. Instead, we work with creative, relatively new companies with innovative solutions trying to help people solve their health issues in new ways. These new companies need awareness and that’s where we come in. We use cutting-edge lead generation and sales automation to help consumers find our clients.</p><p><strong>Here are a few examples of folks we work with:</strong></p><ul><li>A DNA lab testing company that helps people discover if they are at risk of hereditary cancers.</li><li>A services company that treats people with prediabetes and prevents them from developing Type II diabetes. One-third of adults have prediabetes!</li><li>A medical device company that helps women who have been struggling with bladder control for years.</li><li>Too many to list them all here.</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><ul><li>Experienced, Licensed Nurse (RNs )</li><li>Experience in Sales</li><li>Customer Service Experience</li><li>Detail Oriented</li><li>Ability to Commit to a Set Weekly Schedule</li></ul><p>To apply: Please complete the application and respond with a short paragraph or two on why you think you’re a fit. Please attach your resume and also add in what experience you’ve had (if any) working with a virtual company, in sales, on the phone, and in health care.</p><p>Once you have completed the above step please click on the link below and complete our pre-test. This is MANDATORY and we will not be able to schedule any interviews or consider you if this pre-test is not completed.</p><p>https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdYdZhxQl7PARpnnNbKKA4E7ohP3xFuTbSRIsUh62bVCxGAfg/viewform</p><p>Please do NOT call our office to inquire about the role or ask about your application status. We receive a high volume of applications and are unable to return calls. Complete all the steps outlined, and if we think you are a good fit, we will contact you.</p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><p>$30/hour</p><p><strong>Work from home.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://83bar.workable.com/jobs/1059724' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
