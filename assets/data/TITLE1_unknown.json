Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>ACT’s Core Infrastructure team is seeking fundraisers to help build the zero carbon footprint future version of our planet. Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>We believe that the core problem of global warming is lack of global collaboration. Our goal is to support and enhance global collaboration facilitated by an ecosystem of carefully crafted software systems. Just like Wikipedia is a computer facilitated collaboration platform around building the world’s biggest encyclopedia – so will ACT enable collaboration around green shopping and help humans ACT together for a sustainable planet so that we can do our part to end global warming and also support fair trade.</p><p>- ACT is software technology with smart gamification to connect consumers around sustainable shopping and collaboration.<br>- The immediate goal of ACT is to reduce climate gasses and possibly be the “solution” to global climate change.<br>- ACT is a role model of a democratic organization: Max factor of 8 between highest and lowest paid, all employees has 1 vote, no person or organization can own voting shares (i.e. no external organization can control ACT, which is important to keep us a partner of independent advice).<br>- All software is expected to be open source and free, so that all can take action.</p><p>We have just finished a major design phase and now wish to start serious development of the software platform. We are looking to tell the world about our extraordinary solution for ACTion, that we believe will change the way we manage global climate change almost overnight.</p><p>We need to strengthen our team, our advisory board and council with experienced resources within multiple fields: Management, Communication/journalism/marketing, Financial management, Fundraising, Life cycle analysis &amp; research, Graphical design, Web development, Mobile development, Backend development, Networking.</p><p>WHY ACT?<br>Have you ever thought that it is impossible to solve global climate change and that your effort would mean so little?</p><p>What if you had the chance to work with one of the most ambitious climate change projects? We believe that ACT is one of the most hands-on solutions to mitigating climate change. These might sound like just 'great words,' but do the math yourself: E.g. If only 1700 people decided to use ACT to find the least fossil fuel consuming goods, service alternatives and register their purchases it would deliver a combined purchasing power of 63 million USD/year after tax*, which is the same amount Norway uses to conserve the Amazonas rainforest! And those 1700 people could decide to ACT tomorrow!</p><p>* Assuming a salary of 37,000 USD/year after tax.</p><p>JOB DESCRIPTION, FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS<br>ACT is now selling shares and applying for funding with various organizations. We need 2 highly motivated FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS to join our Core team in this exciting phase that will have a serious impact on sustainability of our planet. </p><p>At best the following requirements apply to you:</p><p>- You have applied and won support from Innovasjon Norge on multiple occasions.<br>- You have applied and won support from various other foundations.<br>- You have experience from selling shares.<br>- You have a good network.<br>- You have a good command of English.</p><p>The fundraisers will work closely with co-founders and be a part of our small team of entrepreneurs with a flat organizational structure. Since the company is in an early phase you will be able to shape your role in the company exactly how you like it best.</p><p>WORK PLACE<br>This job should at best be carried out as much as possible in co-location with ACT in Oslo, but we are open to remote work too.</p><p>APPLICATION<br>Please send your CV and some words introducing yourself, why you want to work with ACT, highlight relevant previous experience and your current situation.</p><p>For more information about this job and ACT please contact:</p><p>Thomas Jepsen<br>President, Founder &amp; CTO<br>ACT Cooperative Corporation AS</p></div>",

You will constantly be challenged to learn new technologies and extend your knowledge of Iridium’s products. &nbsp;We offer a very agile and empowered environment – if you have a great idea, speak up and present it to the team. If the team loves your idea, then we will look for you to implement it.&nbsp;</p><p>Iridium is an 8-year old company that thinks it is still a startup.&nbsp; What is nice is that we have the startup attitude, but also offer stable and long-term employment with a company that has positive cash flow and is not concerned about running out of money.&nbsp; We offer the start-up mindset, but without the fear that we will close our doors next month.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking for a relaxing job where you can work 8-5 Monday through Friday, then this is not the job for you. The Iridium work experience is fast-paced and high intensity. You will be a member of a team of extremely talented and highly skilled technical employees. We all bring our “whatever it takes attitude” to solving both technical and client issues. You will be empowered to showcase your technical skills and grit on a daily basis. You will be given massive responsibility and be expected to independently manage yourself. We can promise overtime, late nights, and even some weekend work. But we can also promise a great sense of achievement, and a supportive team environment that makes it all worthwhile. Are you a hard-charger? If so, you will fit right in and you will love working here.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from your home office</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>UNLIMITED vacation policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Will invest into your development</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>New laptop</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We want to show developers that resin.io can help, and inspire them to build projects with our platform. We’ve solved the infrastructure problems so developers can focus on their applications. Through examples and content, we want them to see how the resin toolkit works in the real world.</p><p>That means creating cool hardware projects (machine learning on a Raspberry Pi, for example), highlighting customer case studies, building integrations with third party tools, and writing content to communicate the value of resin. It also means sharing and promoting our story in a way that resonates with developers and engaging with our community members. You’ll help us spread the message by showing people what’s possible with resin.io.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Build hardware projects that demonstrate the power of resin.io.</li><li>Write up tutorials, blog posts, and case studies.</li><li>Share your projects and content with developers.</li><li>Engage with resin community members and help them build projects of their own.</li><li>Partner with other communities to build integrations and show how our platforms work well together.</li><li>Encourage resin.io team members to share their own projects, and help highlight interesting work from the team.</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p>Need to have:</p><ul><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills (in English).</li><li>Able to understand and empathize with developers and IoT project owners (maybe you are one yourself!)</li><li>Able to turn technical details into clear and interesting content.</li><li>Passionate about trying new technologies and always curious to learn new things.</li><li>Willing and able to develop a deep understanding of the resin.io platform.</li><li>Interested in hacking on hardware projects.</li><li>Highly organized, able to handle many threads at once, and keep things moving.</li><li>Self-motivated and able to drive results without too much management.</li><li>Desire to make yourself and others more effective. You’re always looking for ways to improve the process.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Nice to have:</p><ul><li>Technical or engineering background.</li><li>Experience with resin.io-related technologies (e.g. Docker, Linux, IoT devices like the Raspberry Pi).</li><li>Experience creating and promoting developer-focused tutorials and content.</li></ul><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><ul><li>Work with extremely talented, diverse team</li><li>Equipment of your choice</li><li>Remote-friendly</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Generous vacation policy</li><li>Annual company gathering in an international location</li><li>We send you hardware for side projects!</li></ul><p><strong>About working at Resin.io</strong></p><p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://resin.workable.com/j/27A101659C' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Resin.io</h3>            <div><p>Resin.io provides a software platform that helps developers build, deploy and manage code on connected devices.

Our investors include DFJ, Aspect Ventures, GE, and Ericsson.</p><p>Resin is a highly distributed, remote-friendly company. We rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages.

We want to show developers that resin.io can help, and inspire them to build projects with our platform. We’ve solved the infrastructure problems so developers can focus on their applications. Through examples and content, we want them to see how the resin toolkit works in the real world.<br><br>That means creating cool hardware projects (machine learning on a Raspberry Pi, for example), highlighting customer case studies, building integrations with third party tools, and writing content to communicate the value of resin. It also means sharing and promoting our story in a way that resonates with developers and engaging with our community members. You’ll help us spread the message by showing people what’s possible with resin.io.<br><br><br>Responsibilities<br><br><br>* Build hardware projects that demonstrate the power of resin.io.<br><br>* Write up tutorials, blog posts, and case studies.<br><br>* Share your projects and content with developers.<br><br>* Engage with resin community members and help them build projects of their own.<br><br>* Partner with other communities to build integrations and show how our platforms work well together.<br><br>* Encourage resin.io team members to share their own projects, and help highlight interesting work from the team.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>REQUIREMENTS<br><br>Need to have:<br><br><br>* Excellent written and verbal communication skills (in English).<br><br>* Able to understand and empathize with developers and IoT project owners (maybe you are one yourself!)<br><br>* Able to turn technical details into clear and interesting content.<br><br>* Passionate about trying new technologies and always curious to learn new things.<br><br>* Willing and able to develop a deep understanding of the resin.io platform.<br><br>* Interested in hacking on hardware projects.<br><br>* Highly organized, able to handle many threads at once, and keep things moving.<br><br>* Self-motivated and able to drive results without too much management.<br><br>* Desire to make yourself and others more effective. You’re always looking for ways to improve the process.&nbsp;<br><br><br><br><br>Nice to have:<br><br><br>* Technical or engineering background.<br><br>* Experience with resin.io-related technologies (e.g. Docker, Linux, IoT devices like the Raspberry Pi).<br><br>* Experience creating and promoting developer-focused tutorials and content.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>BENEFITS<br><br><br>* Work with extremely talented, diverse team<br><br>* Equipment of your choice<br><br>* Remote-friendly<br><br>* Flexible working hours<br><br>* Generous vacation policy<br><br>* Annual company gathering in an international location<br><br>* We send you hardware for side projects!<br><br><br><br><br>About working at Resin.io<br><br>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.<br><br>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.<br><br>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.<p>See more jobs at <span>Resin.io</span></p></div></div>",

    "content": "A great opportunity to see for yourself what a very-early-stage startup looks like from inside. <br /><br />We will be developing together the coolest project for millennials living abroad : a survival kit connected to a chatbot that welcomes people anywhere in the world!<br /><br />I need someone that can learn fast and can adapt to any situation, just like an entrepreneur does. I am the founder of KitNations, and I created a survival kit for people settling in London (and soon Paris, Montreal, LA, Singap...).<br /><br />The job will consist of:<br /><br />1. Contacting pubs, bars, restaurants all over London to create partnerships<br /><br />2. Creating some cool content and posting on Insta/Fb/Snap...<br /><br />3. Help me in many other tasks, grinding daily, and see THE REAL STARTUP LIFE from inside.<br /><br />If you always wondered what it could be like to launch your own company, bootstrap, grind, and make a cool product, join me!<br /><br />You're not afraid of pushing it to the limits and propose new ideas/learn new skills everyday? The ambience is very relaxed, but we will be grinding hard, and I will be raising a good seed in a few months, so why not hire you later on? <br /><br />I can't pay you though (not yet). Flexible hours. Looking for someone that likes things done well. <br /><br />Juste send me a DM with the skills you already have (Indesign? Photoshop? Coding? Photography? Video? I want someone that is eager to learn and multi-task). No formalities please!<br /><br />The job is in Camberwell/Brixton but you can work from home, we'll see together. <br /><br />Check what we do before you apply and if you believe in the idea, DM and tell me in a few words what you would like to bring to the concept!<br />",
