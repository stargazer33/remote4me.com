Three years ago I started Mixtiles together with David, my business partner and best friend. Since then, we’ve completely changed what people do with their photos and how they bring them to life, with millions of our tiles proudly presented on people’s walls.</p><p>We’re looking for a great VP Finance to join our team. Our company has grown significantly, and so have our finance needs. With our revenue run rate in the tens of millions of dollars, several international subsidiaries, tier-one equity and debt partners, and our own manufacturing facilities in several countries, we need a VP Finance who believes in our vision and can help us scale in pursuit of becoming the way the entire world puts photos on walls.</p><p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll take ownership of our existing financial processes and systems.</li><li>You’ll make our finances predictable and safe for high growth.</li><li>You’ll use your intimate understanding of our business to initiate growth strategies, such as sophisticated pricing schemes, shipping optimizations, marketing optimizations, supply chain modeling and raising growth capital.</li><li>You’ll own the company’s financial dashboards.</li><li>You’ll find new angles of looking at the company’s data in a way that’s actionable and has high impact.</li><li>You’ll work directly with our CEO, other executives and our board.</li><li>You’ll be a major contributor to the company’s success.</li></ul><p><strong>Who should you be?</strong></p><ul><li>We’re looking for someone who is data-driven; comfortable with modeling, statistics and data projects. While we expect you to have a deep understanding of all aspects of the financial side of the company (reporting, taxes, accounting, debt) we also expect you to have a passion for the business side (the market, competition, valuation, etc.). The way we see it, they’re two sides of the same entity.</li><li>You’re a player-coach who can get a lot done by yourself and can also lead a small team. You’re good with technology and have a lot of experience with Google Sheets. Great social skills are essential; people should love talking with you. You’ll have a sense of ownership and high standards.</li></ul><p><strong>Mixtiles is a fully remote company</strong></p><p>We’re a fully remote company. We don’t have a central office, and we all work from home or a shared office space of our choice. Working from home allows us to live a better life, and we think it’s also more productive. It isn’t for everyone, but we think it is for a lot of people. And we’ve noticed that people who like it, really like it.</p><p><strong>Our Vision</strong></p><p>Here’s how we think about the future. Every day, masses of people put photos on walls. They’ve been doing it since the days of cave paintings. Even today, they still use hammers, nails and pay $40+ per photo. We believe everyone would prefer a photo that sticks easily, leaves no marks and costs $10. It’s simple, and it makes sense.</p><p>Our focus is on spreading the word about Mixtiles and improving our product to meet our vision. We want Mixtiles to be the way the whole world puts photos on walls. And yes, that also means generating billions of dollars in revenue and profits.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/mixtiles/2fd96039-fa21-47ce-9be1-0591e781b7be' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

    "content": "<span>Binary Mint | San Francisco, REMOTE/ONSITE<p>Here at Binary Mint, we fundamentally believe in the value of blockchains, which enable the creation of “decentralized applications,” or DApps. DApps are trustless, transparent, interoperable, and unstoppable, and thus have the potential to empower users in unprecedented ways.</p><p>But just like how web 2.0 did not take off until it started seeing usage outside of the military and academia, blockchains are not going to take off until DApps are being used by the average consumers. And yet, it’s the unfortunate reality today that DApps have very little usage outside of finance. The reason is that it’s currently extremely difficult to create DApps that can handle a large number of users efficiently, due to technical limitations with existing blockchains and the lack of good tooling for building DApps.</p><p>Binary Mint is all about creating technologies that will make consumer DApps a reality. Our first product is the Tenfold Protocol (<a href='https://www.tenfoldprotocol.io/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.tenfoldprotocol.io/</a>), a practical and versatile platform on which developers can easily build DApps that scale.</p><p>Binary Mint is an early-stage startup. As such, you can expect to be wearing many hats, becoming a leader in the company, and making a large impact. We are looking for people who are responsible, driven, and great at what they do. We are a distributed team with a base in San Francisco; both local and remote hires are very welcome.</p><p>The full list of open positions can be found here: <a href='https://github.com/binary-mint/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/binary-mint/careers</a></p><p>To apply to any of these positions, please email careers@binarymint.io</p></span>",

You will constantly be challenged to learn new technologies and extend your knowledge of Iridium’s products. &nbsp;We offer a very agile and empowered environment – if you have a great idea, speak up and present it to the team. If the team loves your idea, then we will look for you to implement it.&nbsp;</p><p>Iridium is an 8-year old company that thinks it is still a startup.&nbsp; What is nice is that we have the startup attitude, but also offer stable and long-term employment with a company that has positive cash flow and is not concerned about running out of money.&nbsp; We offer the start-up mindset, but without the fear that we will close our doors next month.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are looking for a relaxing job where you can work 8-5 Monday through Friday, then this is not the job for you. The Iridium work experience is fast-paced and high intensity. You will be a member of a team of extremely talented and highly skilled technical employees. We all bring our “whatever it takes attitude” to solving both technical and client issues. You will be empowered to showcase your technical skills and grit on a daily basis. You will be given massive responsibility and be expected to independently manage yourself. We can promise overtime, late nights, and even some weekend work. But we can also promise a great sense of achievement, and a supportive team environment that makes it all worthwhile. Are you a hard-charger? If so, you will fit right in and you will love working here.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from your home office</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>UNLIMITED vacation policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Will invest into your development</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>New laptop</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>ACT’s Core Infrastructure team is seeking fundraisers to help build the zero carbon footprint future version of our planet. Sounds interesting? Read on.</p><p>We believe that the core problem of global warming is lack of global collaboration. Our goal is to support and enhance global collaboration facilitated by an ecosystem of carefully crafted software systems. Just like Wikipedia is a computer facilitated collaboration platform around building the world’s biggest encyclopedia – so will ACT enable collaboration around green shopping and help humans ACT together for a sustainable planet so that we can do our part to end global warming and also support fair trade.</p><p>- ACT is software technology with smart gamification to connect consumers around sustainable shopping and collaboration.<br>- The immediate goal of ACT is to reduce climate gasses and possibly be the “solution” to global climate change.<br>- ACT is a role model of a democratic organization: Max factor of 8 between highest and lowest paid, all employees has 1 vote, no person or organization can own voting shares (i.e. no external organization can control ACT, which is important to keep us a partner of independent advice).<br>- All software is expected to be open source and free, so that all can take action.</p><p>We have just finished a major design phase and now wish to start serious development of the software platform. We are looking to tell the world about our extraordinary solution for ACTion, that we believe will change the way we manage global climate change almost overnight.</p><p>We need to strengthen our team, our advisory board and council with experienced resources within multiple fields: Management, Communication/journalism/marketing, Financial management, Fundraising, Life cycle analysis &amp; research, Graphical design, Web development, Mobile development, Backend development, Networking.</p><p>WHY ACT?<br>Have you ever thought that it is impossible to solve global climate change and that your effort would mean so little?</p><p>What if you had the chance to work with one of the most ambitious climate change projects? We believe that ACT is one of the most hands-on solutions to mitigating climate change. These might sound like just 'great words,' but do the math yourself: E.g. If only 1700 people decided to use ACT to find the least fossil fuel consuming goods, service alternatives and register their purchases it would deliver a combined purchasing power of 63 million USD/year after tax*, which is the same amount Norway uses to conserve the Amazonas rainforest! And those 1700 people could decide to ACT tomorrow!</p><p>* Assuming a salary of 37,000 USD/year after tax.</p><p>JOB DESCRIPTION, FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS<br>ACT is now selling shares and applying for funding with various organizations. We need 2 highly motivated FUNDRAISERS / MARKETEERS to join our Core team in this exciting phase that will have a serious impact on sustainability of our planet. </p><p>At best the following requirements apply to you:</p><p>- You have applied and won support from Innovasjon Norge on multiple occasions.<br>- You have applied and won support from various other foundations.<br>- You have experience from selling shares.<br>- You have a good network.<br>- You have a good command of English.</p><p>The fundraisers will work closely with co-founders and be a part of our small team of entrepreneurs with a flat organizational structure. Since the company is in an early phase you will be able to shape your role in the company exactly how you like it best.</p><p>WORK PLACE<br>This job should at best be carried out as much as possible in co-location with ACT in Oslo, but we are open to remote work too.</p><p>APPLICATION<br>Please send your CV and some words introducing yourself, why you want to work with ACT, highlight relevant previous experience and your current situation.</p><p>For more information about this job and ACT please contact:</p><p>Thomas Jepsen<br>President, Founder &amp; CTO<br>ACT Cooperative Corporation AS</p></div>",

I am the founder of KitNations, and I created a survival kit for people settling in London (and soon Paris, Montreal, LA, Singap...).<br /><br />The job will consist of:<br /><br />1. Contacting pubs, bars, restaurants all over London to create partnerships<br /><br />2. Creating some cool content and posting on Insta/Fb/Snap...<br /><br />3. Help me in many other tasks, grinding daily, and see THE REAL STARTUP LIFE from inside.<br /><br />If you always wondered what it could be like to launch your own company, bootstrap, grind, and make a cool product, join me!<br /><br />You're not afraid of pushing it to the limits and propose new ideas/learn new skills everyday? The ambience is very relaxed, but we will be grinding hard, and I will be raising a good seed in a few months, so why not hire you later on? <br /><br />I can't pay you though (not yet). Flexible hours. Looking for someone that likes things done well. <br /><br />Juste send me a DM with the skills you already have (Indesign? Photoshop? Coding? Photography? Video? I want someone that is eager to learn and multi-task). No formalities please!<br /><br />The job is in Camberwell/Brixton but you can work from home, we'll see together. <br /><br />Check what we do before you apply and if you believe in the idea, DM and tell me in a few words what you would like to bring to the concept!<br />",
