    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already installed in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 12 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as a technically inclined<br /><br />*Customer* *Support* *Lead*<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount<br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />We are looking for an experienced Customer Support Lead to help us with our user and installer base.<br /><br />The role requires a high degree of initiative and an ability to manage a varied workload whilst under pressure. The successful candidate will be service focused and have a proactive/can do attitude combined with excellent communication skills<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />* Build and manage our customer support function<br />* Active receipt and solution of support calls and emails from users and installers<br />* Manage and set up out of hours contact centre<br />* Contribute to the development of the Switchee product through feature and bug reporting<br />* Develop marketing material to residents and installers<br />* Produce Helpline KPIs and database<br />* Support on deliveries, unit preparation and order logistics<br />* Contribute to the development and creation video content about the product<br />* Periodically being on-call for out of hours resident support<br />* As part of the team you may take part in other activities such as trade fairs / exhibitions, help with event setup and support the team during the show.<br /><br /><br />Switchee is a company built on a strong technical foundation. You will need to triage, problem-solve and communicate effectively with users and engineers. We also expect you to work closely with Product Development to ensure our product evolves with the customer’s needs at the very centre.<br /><br />*Your* *experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has/is:<br /><br />* Technically inclined<br />* Experience in customer support, especially in call centre environment<br />* Excellent communicator<br />* Good at working under pressure, problem-solving<br />* Availability to attend end-user site visits<br />* Friendly and helpful person, excellent interpersonal skills<br />* Fluent speaking and writing in English. Other languages are also desirable<br /><br /><br />Ideal, but not essential:<br /><br />* Some understanding of heating systems<br />* Knowledge of helpdesk software e.g. Zendesk<br />* Experience in technical support by phone, email and on-site would be an advantage<br />* A background in social housing, energy efficiency or product.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />*You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter on our website as soon as possible!",

We’re searching for a </span><span><b>New Client Coordinator</b></span><span> to help our CEO and the rest of our team solve our clients’ biggest problem. If you’re looking for a position where you can </span><span><b>set your own hours</b></span><span>, </span><span><b>take holidays as you see fit</b></span><span>, </span><span><b>work remotely from home or anywhere in the world</b></span><span>, and </span><span><b>help medical research succeed</b></span><span>, then please read on. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Today’s highly sophisticated medical system has added nearly 20 years of life expectancy, reduced infant mortality by 90% and maternal mortality by 99%. Polio, leprosy, smallpox, and tuberculosis are practically eradicated, even in the poorest countries in the world. There’s plenty of room for improvement, but a big part of what’s been achieved is due to new medications, medical devices and understanding developed through clinical research.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Our clients</b></span><span> – academic researchers and medical research organizations, are working hard to continue to develop treatments and devices, increase our understanding, eradicate sickness and improve quality of life. Their biggest challenge is spending half of their time searching for and never being able to recruit enough of the patients required for their clinical trials.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Our company</b></span><span> – Trialfacts, removes the biggest hurdle and frustration to conducting their research, by recruiting the patients they require for their clinical trials, and many times thereby saving their research. We’re the only company in the industry to also do this in a predictable and reliable manner, by determining upfront exactly how many patients we can recruit, and backing that up with a money-back guarantee.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span></span></div><div><b>We're looking for someone who can: </b></div><div><br></div><div><b>Communicate</b>— A large part of this role involves corresponding with and educating potential clients, mostly by email. This includes responding to enquiries generated by our outbound email campaign and inbound through our website, as well as following up with each new client opportunity.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Coordinate</b>— You’ll be performing the critical role of managing each potential new client opportunity as a project. It’s your job to coordinate with our CEO Nick; who is our salesperson, Jess; who performs our Due Diligence process, and researchers; our potential clients, to ensure that each opportunity is progressing through the stages of our new client pipeline like a well-oiled machine.</div><div><br></div><div><span>To do this you’ll need a relentless focus on next steps, client education, coordination of people, and serious organization skills to do this at scale across a large number of new client opportunities simultaneously.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Learn</b>— No experience is necessary, but you’ll need to rapidly develop a thorough understanding of the industry, our clients, their concerns, our service, and new software and technology. You’ll be trained and work closely with our CEO, so you can hit the ground running, but you’ll also need to be able to independently learn via courses and other resources that we’ll pay for.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Market</b>— The other part of this role is to work with our CEO Nick and other team members to implement additional marketing strategies to grow the number of new client meetings performed by Nick each week. Right now we’re seeing a lot of success from, and are mostly focused on our content marketing.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What's in it for you:</b></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Autonomy</b></span><span> — We don’t have set working hours. We don’t have a holiday policy (you can take holidays whenever you want). We don’t micromanage or babysit. You’ll be accountable to the rest of the team purely on your results, and not on the number of hours spent working. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><span>Our team is remote (we communicate via&nbsp;</span><a href='https://slack.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>Slack</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://hangouts.google.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>Google Hangouts</span></a><span> and </span><a href='https://basecamp.com' rel='nofollow'><span>Basecamp</span></a><span>). We set our own hours based on what works for us and our clients. As long as you have a good internet connection you can work from wherever you choose.</span></span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Innovation</b></span><span> —&nbsp;</span><span>We’re the first and only company in our industry to guarantee our results. We’ve launched innovative patient recruitment strategies (e.g. our phone screening appointment system, researcher interviews</span><span>) that provide predictability and certainty in a volatile industry, and we’re constantly improving our service. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We apply the same innovative approach internally to how we operate our business. We’ve streamlined and automated (think templated emails, automated follow-up, and optimized proposal templates) a lot of our new opportunity pipeline, and are constantly testing the latest and greatest sales automation tools (e.g.&nbsp;</span><a href='https://mixmax.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>Mixmax</span></a><span>, </span><a href='https://www.prosperworks.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>ProsperWorks</span></a><span>,&nbsp;</span><a href='https://zapier.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>Zapier</span></a><span> etc)</span><span>. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Impact</b></span><span> — Trialfacts plays an extremely important role in contributing to medical research and driving humanity forward. Our clients—researchers working at universities, pharmaceutical companies, biotech companies, natural medicine companies, hospitals and medical practices—work hard to develop treatments and technology that cure diseases and improve quality of life.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are the only company that solves recruitment problems in a predictable and reliable way—our consistent, results-driven process makes us the only recruitment company that provides a money-back guarantee.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Growth</b></span><span> — As a member of a small team you'll be exposed to many areas of the business. You'll be given the opportunity to learn many new skills and experiment in many new areas, as well as progress and build on what you already know. You'll be testing and implementing new marketing strategies. You'll have access to courses and training programs of your choice, paid for by Trialfacts.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Opportunity</b></span><span> — As a small and innovative team we’ve done away with outdated corporate thinking like the physical office, micromanaging and bureaucratic leave processes, but we haven’t thrown the baby out with the bathwater. We offer a stable salary + results-based compensation package, discretionary annual bonuses, annual salary review, a personal and tailored development plan reviewed with you every three months, and the possibility to grow into positions of additional responsibility and leadership in the future.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re growing rapidly through repeat business, referrals and new clients. We're an innovative company in an industry ripe for disruption. The future looks optimistic as we continue to improve and expand on our core service.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>This position is for you if you:</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><ul><li><span><b>Excel at written &amp; spoken communication</b></span><span> - from answering potential client emails to communicating with colleagues, being able to write well is a must for any Trialfacts position, and especially this one. Being in a remote team, you must be great at communicating, and if necessary be willing to pick up the phone and speak with our clients.</span></li><li><span><b>Are highly organized</b></span><span> - you'll be interacting with many different potential clients, while also managing enquiries from existing lead generation campaigns. If you're not highly organized and comfortable in a fast-paced environment then you're not a good-fit for this role.</span></li><li><span><b>Are flexible</b></span><span> - in an entrepreneurial business we sometimes have to wear different hats. We're looking for someone that takes ownership and wants to help grow our company. If you're the kind of person who would rather sit back and say </span><em>&quot;that's not my responsibility&quot;</em><span> then please don't apply.</span><br></li></ul><ul><li><span><b>Love learning</b></span><span> - we're a team that's driven by learning and improving. We're looking for someone who wants to learn and develop their professional and business skills, grow as a person and constantly improve the service that we provide. This includes someone who is comfortable getting up to speed quickly and is able to quickly understand the unique situation each client is in.</span></li><li><span><b>Have a passion for making data-driven decisions</b></span><span> - these days marketing and all parts of business requires a love of data. If you’re not comfortable with gathering, cleaning and interpreting data, then please don’t apply. You don’t need to have a statistics PhD, but if you’re not comfortable with Excel, then this is not the position for you.</span></li><li><b>Are proficient in HTML</b> - Similar to the above, marketing today relies heavily on technology and automation. You don’t need any formal development experience but if you’re not comfortable with at least HTML, please don’t apply. Similarly, if you’re not the kind of person that loves testing out new tools and technology, this position is not a good fit.<br></li><li><span><b>Are results-driven</b></span><span> - you will be coached and guided, but ultimately you will be responsible for your performance which will directly impact your compensation.</span></li><li><span><b>Are looking for a full-time position</b></span><span> - we’re experiencing growth and we need someone who can fully commit to Trialfacts and get up to speed fairly quickly. We’re not looking for someone who has their own part-time business or freelancing career on the side.</span></li></ul><div><span><b><br></b></span></div><div><span><b>Summary</b></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Yes, this position description is so long that it needs a summary! Here are the facts: &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Set your own hours</b>: Choose when and how you work, but there needs to be some flexibility to have training and meetings with our CEO Nick, located in Australia. This is a full-time position.</li><li><b>Work remotely</b>: We’re a virtual team located around the globe. You can live nearly anywhere or travel with this position. You will need a reliable internet connection.</li><li><b>Results-based environment</b>: You’ll be evaluated based on your results. You will not be micromanaged, and you have the flexibility to set your own hours and work however you like, but you need to be contributing to our target number of new client conversations scheduled with our CEO Nick each week, and the number of new clients we welcome onboard each month.</li><li><b>Commitment to learning</b>: We believe in continuous improvement and growth. You’ll be mentored, guided, and trained by our CEO Nick, our team and external resources, courses and training programs paid for by Trialfacts.</li><li><b>Contribute something meaningful to the world</b>: We make a lot of medical research possible that would otherwise fail, and remove the #1 headache faced by researchers in a predictable and reliable manner, backed by our money-back guarantee.</li><li><b>Trial period</b>: There will be an initial paid trial period probably lasting 2-3 weeks, but it’s possible it might be longer.</li><li><b>Compensation</b>: Compensation will be a monthly salary plus performance-based compensation package. Salaries are reviewed annually.</li></ul><div><span></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>If you're interested in this position, then please email us at <a href='mailto:applications@trialfacts.com' rel='nofollow'>applications@trialfacts.com</a> with the subject “New Client Coordinator Application – [Your Name]” and tell us why we should consider you. Please also let us know how you heard about this position, and include in your application your current career goals and why you would like this position. Please also address where you will think you’ll be located.Please note, you may find the application process differs a little from what you might expect. Although there will be phone interviews, an interview alone is a poor way to assess a candidate, so I’ll also be asking you to complete a few short tasks. These tasks are quick and designed to be fun and informative, but also to assess something about you. After each task I will let you know if you were successful in proceeding to the next round. If all goes well I’ll ask you to undertake a paid trial to see if there is a good fit, before making a final decision.</p>  </div>",

You’re someone who thrives working remotely without much oversight. You’ll be part of the Support Team which is currently ten people. We’re a fully remote team with employees around world.

You’ll be given plenty of autonomy to do what’s right and in the best interests of our customers.</p><h5>About CircleCI</h5><p>CircleCI is the best platform for software teams looking to rapidly build quality projects, at scale.
