People around the globe use me to make their lives a little easier, and the lovely humans supporting them are spread out all the way from Hawaii to Australia. Where’s Acuity HQ, you ask? Your heart, I say. (Or house. Or favorite coffee shop. Or maybe even a dragon lair?)</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways. While I don't usually do this sort of thing, I figured it was time to &quot;put myself out there&quot; and see if, just maybe, the right person might be reading on the other side of the screen.</div><div><br></div><div>Where to begin? Well, for starters, I help small and medium sized businesses keep their schedules organized. It's a great gig, and I like when people tell me how much they love me. Though I am always sad when, at the end of the day, they abandon me (my log-out button is my least favorite physical feature) and go on to do things they tell me humans do, like go to happy hour and play with these things called &quot;the kids.&quot;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>My dad, Gavin, is great. He built me from scratch a decade ago (which means I'm officially in the double digits!). They tell me he's a wonderful boss to work for, and that's where you come in.</div><div><br></div><div>We need another human to come work with us, in order to help even MORE humans. (You all are everywhere.)</div><div><br></div><div>You see, while I'm very useful to your kind (especially what you refer to as &quot;business owners&quot;), sometimes people can be confused by my buttons, bells and whistles. I love to whistle.</div><div><br></div><div>So, my dad decided to get together some other smart humans to help out. Before long, though, there was so much to do! Humans are very limited in their processing capacity, you know. So my dad hired some more humans. And then some more. Because apparently I am growing at the - how do you call it? speed of light? - so while my dad is very happy, it also means we need even more hands.</div><div><br></div><div>Not just any old hands, of course. And not just any old human. We're looking for a very special human--one who loves to dig in, solve problems, be on a team, laugh together, hustle together, and want a long term relationship with me. (Sorry my dad taught me early on that one night stands are bad.)</div><div><br></div><div>And guess what? The best part is that you don't even need to live where I do, you can live anywhere. Cool, right? My sister, the internet, has made life quite convenient for your race. I'm very proud of her.</div><div><br></div><div>Well, that's enough about me. I talk too much, sometimes. But usually only when my sister is being a pain. We have a love/hate relationship.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, is this you? Could you be my new soul mate?</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Human</li><li>Loves to talk to other humans</li><li>Loves to help other humans</li><li>Loves to write emails to other humans</li><li>Excited about working remotely</li><li>Thinks tech is cool and spends free moments in between bathroom breaks and during the latest episode of Arrested Development brainstorming ways to make me, Acuity, even cooler</li><li>Considers themselves a &quot;self-starting maniac who would get it done even when nobody was looking over their shoulder and even if their significant other begged them to give up everything and go on a free trip to Aruba.&quot; Okay, just kidding about that last part. We just like self-starters. And if your significant other is giving away free trips to Aruba, they should probably come work here, too.</li><li>Likes the idea of having 100% of their medical / dental / vision premiums covered (white teeth, mmhmmmmmm)</li><li>Gets jazzed when they see the term &quot;401K,&quot; and even more jazzed when they read &quot;with 3% of your salary contributed whether you want the money or not&quot; (retirement, mmhmmmmm)</li><li>Loves to learn, because when you work here, you also get an annual $5,000 credit toward continuing education (education, mmhmmmmm)</li><li>Would play a great detective, à la Jessica Fletcher or Dick Tracy, digging to the root of other humans' problems and trying to help them crack the case (even if the case is just &quot;I forgot my password&quot;)</li><li>Can write clearly, AKA doesn't typically communicate in ancient Sanskrit. This is important.</li><li>Bonus gold medal if you understand basic CSS/HTML/Javascript, have experience creating videos and screencasts, have worked in Wordpress, Squarespace, Wix or other website creation tools. (My Space doesn't count unless you worked at My Space, or really like the movie Space Balls.)</li><li>Oh, and the most important part! The salary for the right human is USD $50,000. Told you my dad was a great guy!</li></ul><div>PS -- We love all humans and hope you do, too. Acuity Scheduling is committed to being an Equal Opportunity Employer and we’re looking for amazing people regardless of age, sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability status, size, appearance, race, spiritual or religious beliefs, veteran status, ethnicity, and nationality. Good vibes required.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Do you think you might be THE ONE?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Now accepting love letters. We'll let you decide what to write!

People around the globe use me to make their lives a little easier, and the lovely humans supporting them are spread out all the way from Hawaii to Australia. Where’s Acuity HQ, you ask? Your heart, I say. (Or house. Or favorite coffee shop. Or maybe even a dragon lair?)</div><div><br></div><div>Anyways. While I don't usually do this sort of thing, I figured it was time to &quot;put myself out there&quot; and see if, just maybe, the right person might be reading on the other side of the screen.</div><div><br></div><div>Where to begin? Well, for starters, I help small and medium sized businesses keep their schedules organized. It's a great gig, and I like when people tell me how much they love me. Though I am always sad when, at the end of the day, they abandon me (my log-out button is my least favorite physical feature) and go on to do things they tell me humans do, like go to happy hour and play with these things called &quot;the kids.&quot;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>My dad, Gavin, is great. He built me from scratch a decade ago (which means I'm officially in the double digits!). They tell me he's a wonderful boss to work for, and that's where you come in.</div><div><br></div><div>We need another human to come work with us, in order to help even MORE humans. (You all are everywhere.)</div><div><br></div><div>You see, while I'm very useful to your kind (especially what you refer to as &quot;business owners&quot;), sometimes people can be confused by my buttons, bells and whistles. I love to whistle.</div><div><br></div><div>So, my dad decided to get together some other smart humans to help out. Before long, though, there was so much to do! Humans are very limited in their processing capacity, you know. So my dad hired some more humans. And then some more. Because apparently I am growing at the - how do you call it? speed of light? - so while my dad is very happy, it also means we need even more hands.</div><div><br></div><div>Not just any old hands, of course. And not just any old human. We're looking for a very special human--one who loves to dig in, solve problems, be on a team, laugh together, hustle together, and want a long term relationship with me. (Sorry my dad taught me early on that one night stands are bad.)</div><div><br></div><div>And guess what? The best part is that you don't even need to live where I do, you can live anywhere. Cool, right? My sister, the internet, has made life quite convenient for your race. I'm very proud of her.</div><div><br></div><div>Well, that's enough about me. I talk too much, sometimes. But usually only when my sister is being a pain. We have a love/hate relationship.</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, is this you? Could you be my new soul mate?</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Human</li><li>Loves to talk to other humans</li><li>Loves to help other humans</li><li>Loves to write emails to other humans</li><li>Excited about working remotely</li><li>Thinks tech is cool and spends free moments in between bathroom breaks and during the latest episode of Arrested Development brainstorming ways to make me, Acuity, even cooler</li><li>Considers themselves a &quot;self-starting maniac who would get it done even when nobody was looking over their shoulder and even if their significant other begged them to give up everything and go on a free trip to Aruba.&quot; Okay, just kidding about that last part. We just like self-starters. And if your significant other is giving away free trips to Aruba, they should probably come work here, too.</li><li>Likes the idea of having 100% of their medical / dental / vision premiums covered (white teeth, mmhmmmmmm)</li><li>Gets jazzed when they see the term &quot;401K,&quot; and even more jazzed when they read &quot;with 3% of your salary contributed whether you want the money or not&quot; (retirement, mmhmmmmm)</li><li>Loves to learn, because when you work here, you also get an annual $5,000 credit toward continuing education (education, mmhmmmmm)</li><li>Would play a great detective, à la Jessica Fletcher or Dick Tracy, digging to the root of other humans' problems and trying to help them crack the case (even if the case is just &quot;I forgot my password&quot;)</li><li>Can write clearly, AKA doesn't typically communicate in ancient Sanskrit. This is important.</li><li>Bonus gold medal if you understand basic CSS/HTML/Javascript, have experience creating videos and screencasts, have worked in Wordpress, Squarespace, Wix or other website creation tools. (My Space doesn't count unless you worked at My Space, or really like the movie Space Balls.)</li><li>Oh, and the most important part! The salary for the right human is USD $50,000. Told you my dad was a great guy!</li></ul><div>PS -- We love all humans and hope you do, too. Acuity Scheduling is committed to being an Equal Opportunity Employer and we’re looking for amazing people regardless of age, sex, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability status, size, appearance, race, spiritual or religious beliefs, veteran status, ethnicity, and nationality. Good vibes required.&nbsp;</div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><strong>Do you think you might be THE ONE?</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Now accepting love letters. We'll let you decide what to write!

Here’s why…</p><p>My name is Violet Stoyneva. I am the Operations Manager at Fisico Inc.. We’re a natural health company that sells supplements and nutrition programs online.</p><p>And we’re currently looking for an A-player to join our team and help assist our AMAZING customers. I’ll share the details of the position in a moment. First, a bit about our ideal candidate (please read every word the follows).</p><p>In a nutshell, it’s&nbsp;<strong>someone who has worked in – or is currently working in – a virtual position (i.e. highly self-disciplined and can get the job done with minimal supervision)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Furthermore, the ideal candidate is…</strong></p><ol><li>Reliable. I’m talking about very reliable. Not the,&nbsp;<em>“This usually doesn’t happen, but it happened again”</em>&nbsp;type. We’re a small team and everyone must pull their weight. That means showing up every day and on time — no exceptions (save for a major emergency).</li><li>A natural with people (i.e. very personable and someone who easily makes conversation — even with a perfect stranger). Furthermore, it’s someone who loves talking to and helping customers.</li><li>Experienced and comfortable with taking incoming calls/making outgoing calls.</li><li>Patient, kind, and courteous. The words, “please” and “thank you” should be your “go-to” words when communicating with a customer.</li><li>Happy to perform repetitive tasks and answering the same core group of questions day-in and day-out.</li><li>Is fairly tech-savvy. Nothing advanced but you must know your way around Email clients, Microsoft Office, and apps like Skype.</li><li>Fast at typing (at least 50 WPM).</li><li>Highly organized, and can multi-task with ease. The ideal candidate likely works off checklists and makes sure repetitive tasks are completed with pinpoint accuracy.</li><li>Detail orientated. Glossing over things just won’t do. In fact, try this. At the bottom of this ad you’ll find a link to an application. When you’re done reading the entire ad (and only then) click through and fill it out. The last section asks you to provide additional comments or feedback. Go ahead and write the name of your favorite song in there.</li><li>Cool and relaxed but always pushing to get things done. It’s important that you take responsibility and your main focus is always delivering results.</li></ol><p><strong>Does&nbsp;<u>all of the above</u>&nbsp;describe you? Great, then keep reading for the job description…</strong>&nbsp;The main components of the work would be:</p><ol><li>Responding to every one of our customer’s inquiries via telephone and email (online ticketing system) in a timely fashion. Typical scenarios include tracking lost packages, helping people log on to our website, issuing instructions for returns, and answering basic health questions after learning our products inside and out.</li><li>Making sure every customer is fully satisfied with the proposed resolution you put forth. And above all, keeping your cool and remaining professional when conflicts inevitably arise. If you don’t have thick skin, this position is probably not for you. Here’s why…<ol><li>The overwhelming majority of our customers are a pleasure to deal with. But on occasion, you will interface with someone that is irate, or rarely, even hostile. Whether justifiably so, or not, it is your duty to make things right and turn them into a raving fan.</li></ol></li><li>Processing credits for customers who choose to return items.</li><li>Communicating with our fulfilment team to identify and correct mistakes with shipments.</li><li>As well as several other administrative/web-based tasks related to customer care…</li></ol><p><strong>This is a full-time, work from home position. Currently, we have an opening for 8 am. – 5 pm. EST and 2-8 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday.&nbsp;</strong>Weekend hours are also an option. We offer a full health benefits package (includes dental and vision), paid sick time off and performance bonuses.</p><p>OK, if you’re still reading this, there’s a chance you could be a fit for this position. Again, we’re looking for a dependable, detail-orientated, and easy-going (yet professional) person to join our team. If you’re confident you’re a fit, then please let me know by visiting the link below and submitting an application.</p><p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p><p>Best Wishes,<br>Violet Stoyneva<br>Operations Manager<br>Fisico Inc.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='http://fisicoinc.com/virtual-customer-care-specialist' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Simple edits will be completed within minutes while advanced changes may take longer; it's your job to communicate effectively with our customers and set the right expectations.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The types of customer interactions range from highly technical to conversational. You will mostly deal with folks who are not very WordPress saavy, but there are some who are. That's why you understand your job is to provide answers, insights and solutions, not send customers somewhere else to find help.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Even more important than your responsibilities is how you fit into our team here at WP Buffs. Living and breathing our values and principles is an absolute requirement&nbsp;for any new recruit.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>OUR MISSION<br></h4></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Everything we do is driven by our customers and white-label partners. Our aim is to help as many website owners and digital agencies with WordPress as possible. The goal is to get so many people comfortable with WordPress that it powers 51% of the internet.</div><div></div><div><h4><br></h4></div><div></div><div><h4>OUR VALUES</h4></div><div><br></div><div>You can read all about our values here (https://wpbuffs.com/about-us/).

Asking for help and admitting mistakes resolves problems much more quickly.<br></li><li>Have healthy conflict: It’s important that everyone feel safe to disagree. It hurts the company and the mission to never push each other to make better decisions.<br></li><li>Commit to decisions: Once a decision has been made, the team commits to support it fully.<br></li><li>Accountability to decisions: We are accountable to decisions, deadlines and commitments. Our decisions affect other people (team, customers, etc) and we are each responsible for owning what we commit to.<br></li><li>Focus on results: We are measured by our output, not our input. The process matters much less than the product of that process. Results are our measure of success.<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4>The hiring process looks like:</h4></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>After an initial screening, you'll get an email with a few questions to answer. Following that, you'll have a few video chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If this goes well, we'll invite you to join our team and start your 30-day trial. During this period you'll work hourly as a contractor. This gives you an opportunity to make sure you enjoy the work and the team. Also it gives us an opportunity to evaluate your work. We'll have regular chats each week to share feedback and make sure we're on the same page. At the end of the 30 days, you'll be offered a permanent&nbsp;position if all goes well.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><h4>This position is a great fit for someone who:</h4><h4></h4></div><ul><li>Understands the structural functionality of WordPress<br></li><li>Is confident in their ability to deliver edits within 3-6 hours for 90% of edits<br></li><li>Is a self-starter who loves to deliver sustainable solutions<br></li><li>Enjoys tackling a wide variety of problems over a large range of topics<br></li><li>Demonstrates an ability to adapt and incorporate feedback from others<br></li><li>Has experience troubleshooting simple WordPress and hosting issues<br></li><li>Is a fast learner<br></li><li>Is excited about working with a remote team<br></li><li>Wants a flexible job that's not a traditional 9-5<br></li><li>Appreciates emojis and gifs<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4>Required:</h4><h4></h4></div><ul><li>Firm grasp of the English language through email support<br></li><li>Minimum 3 years in WordPress<br></li><li>Available 5 days a week (Sat-Sun for emergencies)<br></li><li>Responds to new support tickets assigned to them within minutes<br></li><li>Regular WordCamp attendee, speaker, volunteer or organizer<br></li><li>Time management skills<br></li><li>Experience making basic and advanced changes via the WordPress dashboard and FTP<br></li><li>Experience troubleshooting issues within the WordPress dashboard<br></li><li>Experience logging into + moving around hosting provider dashboards<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4>Success in this position looks like:</h4><h4></h4></div><ul><li>Timely completion of ticket edits (3-6 hours for 90% of tickets)<br></li><li>Timely communication with customers on their questions and issues<br></li><li>Timely resolution or escalation of issues where appropriate<br></li><li>Up-to-date notes and information on customer records<br></li><li>You're fun to work with and everyone who works with you has a better day because of it<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4>What we expect:</h4><h4></h4></div><ul><li>Confident and positive engagement with the WP Buffs team<br></li><li>Active participation in WP Buffs internal team chat<br></li><li>Feedback and contribution to the team so we can all learn<br></li><li>Eagerness to learn<br></li><li>Transparency with workload or needs<br></li><li>Ability to turn constructive criticism into improved performance<br></li><li>You must be able to give feedback as well as take it.

    "content": "*About us:*<br /><br />Charlie Casey (CEO) and Dave Clark (CTO) founded LoyaltyLion in 2012, with one clear mission: to help retailers succeed in the age of Amazon. They saw that retailers could never compete with Amazon on price or logistics. But they could offer a better customer experience. One that made customers feel valued, rather than like they were just another number. <br /><br />Getting to today wasn’t easy. The founders spent 12 months doing some serious bootstrapping – using a friend’s lounge as an office, renting the cheapest accommodation (it had no bathroom!) and taking government loans to make LoyaltyLion a success. Happy to say it’s paying off. <br /><br />Today, thousands of fast-growth ecommerce merchants use LoyaltyLion to power their loyalty programs and we have offices in the UK and the USA. <br /><br /><br />*Role:*<br /><br />As a Senior Customer Success Manager you’ll provide strategic loyalty advice to our largest clients (don’t worry, we’ll train you :). You’ll advise them on their launch strategy and how to optimise their programs over time. You’ll also work on renewals. <br /><br />Most of our clients are US based, so we are looking for someone to work US hours. The exact hours are negotiable, but something like 5pm to midnight, would be brilliant. We are flexible with working arrangements (ie. working from home, working part of the day in the office and the rest at home). <br /><br />You’ll be joining a team of three who are all passionate about customer happiness. We currently have exceptionally high customer retention because of the care and time we invest into our client relationships. We’re never satisfied though and we want you to come with your own ideas on how to offer the best post sale customer experience. <br /><br /><br />*Here are some of the activities you’ll be doing:*<br /><br />* Advising merchants on their loyalty launch strategy <br />* Speaking with merchants on a quarterly basis to provide loyalty recommendations<br />* Agreeing contract renewals <br />* Answering support queries when needed <br /><br /><br />*What we're looking for:*<br /><br />Someone who genuinely cares about customer happiness and goes above and beyond to help them succeed.  More about what we want:<br /><br />* Proven experience in software account management <br />* Natural multi-tasker<br />* Impeccable written English <br />* Professionalism in all areas of work<br />* Ability to build rapport, especially in difficult situations <br />* Willingness to work flexible hours - some of our clients are US based  <br />* Desire to make your mark in a fast growth startup<br /><br /><br />*What we offer:*<br /><br />* Opportunity to join a fast growth startup early and at an exciting time - we have doubled the team size in the past 6 months <br />* Flexible working arrangements<br />* Autonomy -  we encourage this<br />* Opportunity to make an impact - we’re a team of 20 so your efforts will make a visible change<br />* Solid existing team<br />* Warehouse office in central London with some great usual startup perks: free lunch Mondays, Beer Fridays, table football and the not so usual - HTC Vive - the best virtual reality in the world and an office favourite :)<br /><br /><br /><br />*To apply:* <br /><br />Please send your CV and a short cover email or apply via our company &quot;careers page&quot;:https://loyaltylion.com/jobs",

You will hear “What’s my login?” one trillion times, and you will have to say, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” with a straight face.<br /> <br />It’s not rocket science, which is why this helpdesk support role pays 30k not 300k, but we’ll throw in contributions to gym membership and a share of your first year’s new orders revenue.<br /> <br />You’ll be dealing with clients’ issues, from the first ticket to resolution. And, of course, you’ll be dealing with dummies who think toolkits are what Dad keeps in the garage, and who don’t know networks from nachos. That’s pretty much all you’ll do, day in, day out, so if you’d rather eat your own face than be polite to people every damn day, stop reading.<br /> <br />Still here? Cool. We also need you to document every step. So explain stuff to clients, and write it down. Officially, this is “retaining system knowledge”. Really it’s so when someone deletes the wrong thing and plunges of Europe into darkness, you can prove you didn’t tell ’em to do it.<br /> <br />To sum up so far:<br /><br />• Answer the damn phone or email, log the damn tickets and help the damn client.<br /><br />• Don’t swear or say stuff like “hybrid cloud” unless you want to freak them out.<br /><br />• Prioritise. If someone says, “I’ve deleted the wrong thing and plunged half of Europe into darkness,” put ’em ahead of someone whose Instagram is freezing.<br /><br />• Pass the buck. No, really. If you can’t resolve the issue, escalate it to Sales, Accounts, Management or upper line support. None of them will thank you for this, so buy them drinks when we go out, even though all of them will be paid more than you.<br /><br />• Maintain a knowledge base and suggest ideas for improvement. Keep these work-related for the probation period, then try asking for at-desk massages and in-house baristas. You won’t get them, but it’ll be slightly harder for us to fire you.<br /> <br />Don’t bother applying unless you have, or can convincingly lie about having:<br /><br />• one year’s experience on a technical and client-focused support desk.<br /><br />• one year’s customer service experience in any sector.<br /><br />• a logical approach to resolving functional and technical issues.<br /><br />• the ability to assess and document client issues, user experiences and processes.<br /><br />• a professional phone and email manner.<br /><br />• the ability to talk to people at different levels, with diverse backgrounds, without sighing or asking if they were dropped on their head as a baby.<br /><br />• experience of being accountable in a small team and the ability to work independently.<br /><br />• understanding of data protection and compliance principles, namely GDPR.<br /> <br />We need you to be organized, systematic, a good communicator, a problem-solver, proactive, reliable and able to prioritise. You need to know the Microsoft Office suite too – but, let’s face it, even your grandma can work Outlook, Word and Excel these days.<br /> <br />If you can do all that, you’re halfway through the door. If you can do all that, and you have experience of MS SharePoint (2010 and 2013), Zendesk, Targetprocess, remote assistance software and support portals, and conceptualising system frameworks and impacts, maybe those massages and baristas will happen.*<br /><br />*They won’t.<br /><br />Interested? please send us a CV and be sure to include a covering letter. That's right you don't go fishing without a hook. We look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />P.S. disclaimer time... we don't really think of end users as dummies - that was just parody.",
