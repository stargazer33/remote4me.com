We’re 4 folks in total, but are part of a larger care team of about 20, that includes email and site-based moderation. Because the support team is so small relative to our user base, each support representative has full ownership over what they’re working on and the opportunity to have a huge amount of impact.</p><p>We encourage suggestions, ideas, innovation, and collaboration across teams.&nbsp;We’re avid collectors of information, and relay that info from our product team and&nbsp;engineers to our users and then back again. We like to think of ourselves as information archeologists, unearthing data and using it help our users find love, and our company get better.</p><p>Another result of our lean team size is the ability to cross-train and learn a ton. You’ll have the opportunity to answer a huge variety of questions from both free and paid users, help write knowledge base articles, monitor and reply to app reviews and social media, compile bug reports, cross-train in billing and moderation, and more.</p><p>As a team, we value&nbsp;curiosity, empathy, communication, positivity, responsible autonomy, and a passion for helping people. We’re also animal fans who tend to be early risers, and we’re passionate supporters of love for absolutely everyone (we take great pride in the partnerships that OkCupid has had in the past with groups like Planned Parenthood and the ACLU).</p><p></p><strong>You’ll have:</strong><ul></ul><li>2 – 5 years experience in a customer service environment, preferably in web/app based support</li><li>The ability to understand sometimes complicated scenarios and respond with appropriate and well-thought-out written solutions</li><li>A thirst for learning, and a passion for helping others learn</li><li>Curiosity and interest in asking hard questions and digging for answers</li><li>Excellent judgement, including knowing when to escalate and how to prioritize</li><li>Enjoys finding discrepancies and putting together patterns</li><li>Sensitivity and empathy to a diverse and global user base</li><li>Strong web savvy and an understanding of internet norms and interactions</li><li>Experience using Android and iPhone apps</li><li>The ability to work reliably and independently from home, with at least one day available during the weekend</li><p>You’ll also be a key part of the team as we move support centers and rework our knowledge base, so you should be flexible and excited about trying new things.</p><p></p><strong>Bonus points for:</strong><ul></ul><li>Fluency in a second language (Hebrew and Hindi especially)</li><li>Familiarity with OkCupid</li><li>Prior success working in a remote environment</li><li>Experience writing and organizing knowledge bases</li><p></p><strong>What are the perks?</strong><ul></ul><li>Competitive salary and full benefits, including Medical, Dental, Vision, and 401k</li><li>Work from home perks: snack boxes, reimbursement for home office setup, create your own schedule (also soon to include company provided computers)</li><li>Happy hours and other events if you live in the NYC area</li><li>Amazing coworkers</li><p></p><strong>In your cover letter:&nbsp;</strong><ul></ul><li>Tell us about the two customer support situations you’re most proud of taking care of, and one that you think you could have done better at</li><li>Include the keyword “okcupidcare”</li><li>Tell us your favorite joke</li><p>OkCupid is an&nbsp;equal opportunity employer that celebrates diversity and is deeply committed to fostering an inclusive environment for all employees.

Here’s why…</p><p>My name is Violet Stoyneva. I am the Operations Manager at Fisico Inc.. We’re a natural health company that sells supplements and nutrition programs online.</p><p>And we’re currently looking for an A-player to join our team and help assist our AMAZING customers. I’ll share the details of the position in a moment. First, a bit about our ideal candidate (please read every word the follows).</p><p>In a nutshell, it’s&nbsp;<strong>someone who has worked in – or is currently working in – a virtual position (i.e. highly self-disciplined and can get the job done with minimal supervision)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Furthermore, the ideal candidate is…</strong></p><ol><li>Reliable. I’m talking about very reliable. Not the,&nbsp;<em>“This usually doesn’t happen, but it happened again”</em>&nbsp;type. We’re a small team and everyone must pull their weight. That means showing up every day and on time — no exceptions (save for a major emergency).</li><li>A natural with people (i.e. very personable and someone who easily makes conversation — even with a perfect stranger). Furthermore, it’s someone who loves talking to and helping customers.</li><li>Experienced and comfortable with taking incoming calls/making outgoing calls.</li><li>Patient, kind, and courteous. The words, “please” and “thank you” should be your “go-to” words when communicating with a customer.</li><li>Happy to perform repetitive tasks and answering the same core group of questions day-in and day-out.</li><li>Is fairly tech-savvy. Nothing advanced but you must know your way around Email clients, Microsoft Office, and apps like Skype.</li><li>Fast at typing (at least 50 WPM).</li><li>Highly organized, and can multi-task with ease. The ideal candidate likely works off checklists and makes sure repetitive tasks are completed with pinpoint accuracy.</li><li>Detail orientated. Glossing over things just won’t do. In fact, try this. At the bottom of this ad you’ll find a link to an application. When you’re done reading the entire ad (and only then) click through and fill it out. The last section asks you to provide additional comments or feedback. Go ahead and write the name of your favorite song in there.</li><li>Cool and relaxed but always pushing to get things done. It’s important that you take responsibility and your main focus is always delivering results.</li></ol><p><strong>Does&nbsp;<u>all of the above</u>&nbsp;describe you? Great, then keep reading for the job description…</strong>&nbsp;The main components of the work would be:</p><ol><li>Responding to every one of our customer’s inquiries via telephone and email (online ticketing system) in a timely fashion. Typical scenarios include tracking lost packages, helping people log on to our website, issuing instructions for returns, and answering basic health questions after learning our products inside and out.</li><li>Making sure every customer is fully satisfied with the proposed resolution you put forth. And above all, keeping your cool and remaining professional when conflicts inevitably arise. If you don’t have thick skin, this position is probably not for you. Here’s why…<ol><li>The overwhelming majority of our customers are a pleasure to deal with. But on occasion, you will interface with someone that is irate, or rarely, even hostile. Whether justifiably so, or not, it is your duty to make things right and turn them into a raving fan.</li></ol></li><li>Processing credits for customers who choose to return items.</li><li>Communicating with our fulfilment team to identify and correct mistakes with shipments.</li><li>As well as several other administrative/web-based tasks related to customer care…</li></ol><p><strong>This is a full-time, work from home position. Currently, we have an opening for 8 am. – 5 pm. EST and 2-8 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday.&nbsp;</strong>Weekend hours are also an option. We offer a full health benefits package (includes dental and vision), paid sick time off and performance bonuses.</p><p>OK, if you’re still reading this, there’s a chance you could be a fit for this position. Again, we’re looking for a dependable, detail-orientated, and easy-going (yet professional) person to join our team. If you’re confident you’re a fit, then please let me know by visiting the link below and submitting an application.</p><p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p><p>Best Wishes,<br>Violet Stoyneva<br>Operations Manager<br>Fisico Inc.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='http://fisicoinc.com/virtual-customer-care-specialist' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Building strong and long-lasting relationships with our customers is our highest priority. We're looking to add a team member who can make the priorities of our customers their own. Your ultimate goals are happy customers and magnificent WordPress websites. Boom!</h4></div><div><br></div><div><i>&quot;WP Buffs is not for everybody. If you're looking for a job that will let you coast, get away with being lazy and not be a team player, you wouldn't last long here. If you're ready to commit to a great team for the long-term, take the next step in your WordPress career and ditch the traditional 9-5, we're looking forward to seeing what you're made of. Booyah!&quot;&nbsp;</i>- Joe Howard, Head Buff</div><div><br></div><div><h4></h4></div><ul><li>You will take the lead on technical support. This position is the very first line of technical support for the majority of our customers when they need edits to their website. That's why you're someone who understands that fast and effective work is paramount. Our customers already have fully-functioning WordPress websites; it's your job to make sure any edits they need are taken care of quickly and effectively.<br></li><li>You will help manage hosting. Of course you're an expert when it comes to the WordPress dashboard, but you also know your way around hosting dashboards for providers like WP Engine, Kinsta, GoDaddy, SiteGround. Regardless of the hosting provider, you can create new FTP credentials and make adjustments via any hosting dashboard.<br></li><li>You will build relationships with our customers. This position is the very first line of contact for the majority of our customers when they need edits to their website. That's why you're someone who always wants to put a smile on somebody's face. Our customers already have fully-functioning WordPress websites; it's your job to make sure any edits they need are taken care of.<br></li><li>You will help on-board new customers. This amounts to a large checklist of tasks required for all new customers and is something you will be trained to do. Your job will be to execute everything correctly to secure, speed up and provide ongoing support for all our customers as well as provide guidance on how to improve these systems and checklists.<br></li><li>If you excel, you will manage a team of WordPress developers. Management experience is not a requirement for this position. But we are looking for someone who has the ability to step back from the technical execution and manage the work of other developers at some point.<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The types of support requests range from highly technical (speed optimization via Pingdom suggestions) to very straight-forward (CSS changes). Simple edits will be completed within minutes while advanced changes may take longer; it's your job to communicate effectively with our customers and set the right expectations.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The types of customer interactions range from highly technical to conversational. You will mostly deal with folks who are not very WordPress saavy, but there are some who are. That's why you understand your job is to provide answers, insights and solutions, not send customers somewhere else to find help.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Even more important than your responsibilities is how you fit into our team here at WP Buffs. Living and breathing our values and principles is an absolute requirement&nbsp;for any new recruit.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>OUR MISSION<br></h4></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Everything we do is driven by our customers and white-label partners. Our aim is to help as many website owners and digital agencies with WordPress as possible. The goal is to get so many people comfortable with WordPress that it powers 51% of the internet.</div><div></div><div><h4><br></h4></div><div></div><div><h4>OUR VALUES</h4></div><div><br></div><div>You can read all about our values here (https://wpbuffs.com/about-us/).

Asking for help and admitting mistakes resolves problems much more quickly.<br></li><li>Have healthy conflict: It’s important that everyone feel safe to disagree. It hurts the company and the mission to never push each other to make better decisions.<br></li><li>Commit to decisions: Once a decision has been made, the team commits to support it fully.<br></li><li>Accountability to decisions: We are accountable to decisions, deadlines and commitments. Our decisions affect other people (team, customers, etc) and we are each responsible for owning what we commit to.<br></li><li>Focus on results: We are measured by our output, not our input. The process matters much less than the product of that process. Results are our measure of success.<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4>The hiring process looks like:</h4></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>After an initial screening, you'll get an email with a few questions to answer. Following that, you'll have a few video chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If this goes well, we'll invite you to join our team and start your 30-day trial. During this period you'll work hourly as a contractor. This gives you an opportunity to make sure you enjoy the work and the team. Also it gives us an opportunity to evaluate your work. We'll have regular chats each week to share feedback and make sure we're on the same page.

Building strong and long-lasting relationships with our customers is our highest priority. We're looking to add a team member who can make the priorities of our customers their own. Your ultimate goals are happy customers and magnificent WordPress websites. Boom!</h4></div><div><br></div><div><i>&quot;WP Buffs is not for everybody. If you're looking for a job that will let you coast, get away with being lazy and not be a team player, you wouldn't last long here. If you're ready to commit to a great team for the long-term, take the next step in your WordPress career and ditch the traditional 9-5, we're looking forward to seeing what you're made of. Booyah!&quot;&nbsp;</i>- Joe Howard, Head Buff</div><div><br></div><div><h4></h4></div><ul><li>You will take the lead on technical support. This position is the very first line of technical support for the majority of our customers when they need edits to their website. That's why you're someone who understands that fast and effective work is paramount. Our customers already have fully-functioning WordPress websites; it's your job to make sure any edits they need are taken care of quickly and effectively.<br></li><li>You will help manage hosting. Of course you're an expert when it comes to the WordPress dashboard, but you also know your way around hosting dashboards for providers like WP Engine, Kinsta, GoDaddy, SiteGround. Regardless of the hosting provider, you can create new FTP credentials and make adjustments via any hosting dashboard.<br></li><li>You will build relationships with our customers. This position is the very first line of contact for the majority of our customers when they need edits to their website. That's why you're someone who always wants to put a smile on somebody's face. Our customers already have fully-functioning WordPress websites; it's your job to make sure any edits they need are taken care of.<br></li><li>You will help on-board new customers. This amounts to a large checklist of tasks required for all new customers and is something you will be trained to do. Your job will be to execute everything correctly to secure, speed up and provide ongoing support for all our customers as well as provide guidance on how to improve these systems and checklists.<br></li><li>If you excel, you will manage a team of WordPress developers. Management experience is not a requirement for this position. But we are looking for someone who has the ability to step back from the technical execution and manage the work of other developers at some point.<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The types of support requests range from highly technical (speed optimization via Pingdom suggestions) to very straight-forward (CSS changes). Simple edits will be completed within minutes while advanced changes may take longer; it's your job to communicate effectively with our customers and set the right expectations.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>The types of customer interactions range from highly technical to conversational. You will mostly deal with folks who are not very WordPress saavy, but there are some who are. That's why you understand your job is to provide answers, insights and solutions, not send customers somewhere else to find help.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Even more important than your responsibilities is how you fit into our team here at WP Buffs. Living and breathing our values and principles is an absolute requirement&nbsp;for any new recruit.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>OUR MISSION<br></h4></div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>Everything we do is driven by our customers and white-label partners. Our aim is to help as many website owners and digital agencies with WordPress as possible. The goal is to get so many people comfortable with WordPress that it powers 51% of the internet.</div><div></div><div><h4><br></h4></div><div></div><div><h4>OUR VALUES</h4></div><div><br></div><div>You can read all about our values here (https://wpbuffs.com/about-us/). They're completely public so that we're accountable for living up to them and our customers can hold us to these standards.</div><div><h4><br></h4></div><div></div><div><h4>OUR TEAM FOUNDATIONS</h4><h4></h4></div><ul><li>Create an environment of trust: It’s hard to be vulnerable and unless we create an environment of trust, we won’t take risks. Asking for help and admitting mistakes resolves problems much more quickly.<br></li><li>Have healthy conflict: It’s important that everyone feel safe to disagree. It hurts the company and the mission to never push each other to make better decisions.<br></li><li>Commit to decisions: Once a decision has been made, the team commits to support it fully.<br></li><li>Accountability to decisions: We are accountable to decisions, deadlines and commitments. Our decisions affect other people (team, customers, etc) and we are each responsible for owning what we commit to.<br></li><li>Focus on results: We are measured by our output, not our input. The process matters much less than the product of that process. Results are our measure of success.<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4>The hiring process looks like:</h4></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>After an initial screening, you'll get an email with a few questions to answer. Following that, you'll have a few video chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>If this goes well, we'll invite you to join our team and start your 30-day trial. During this period you'll work hourly as a contractor. This gives you an opportunity to make sure you enjoy the work and the team. Also it gives us an opportunity to evaluate your work. We'll have regular chats each week to share feedback and make sure we're on the same page. At the end of the 30 days, you'll be offered a permanent&nbsp;position if all goes well.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><h4>This position is a great fit for someone who:</h4><h4></h4></div><ul><li>Understands the structural functionality of WordPress<br></li><li>Is confident in their ability to deliver edits within 3-6 hours for 90% of edits<br></li><li>Is a self-starter who loves to deliver sustainable solutions<br></li><li>Enjoys tackling a wide variety of problems over a large range of topics<br></li><li>Demonstrates an ability to adapt and incorporate feedback from others<br></li><li>Has experience troubleshooting simple WordPress and hosting issues<br></li><li>Is a fast learner<br></li><li>Is excited about working with a remote team<br></li><li>Wants a flexible job that's not a traditional 9-5<br></li><li>Appreciates emojis and gifs<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4>Required:</h4><h4></h4></div><ul><li>Firm grasp of the English language through email support<br></li><li>Minimum 3 years in WordPress<br></li><li>Available 5 days a week (Sat-Sun for emergencies)<br></li><li>Responds to new support tickets assigned to them within minutes<br></li><li>Regular WordCamp attendee, speaker, volunteer or organizer<br></li><li>Time management skills<br></li><li>Experience making basic and advanced changes via the WordPress dashboard and FTP<br></li><li>Experience troubleshooting issues within the WordPress dashboard<br></li><li>Experience logging into + moving around hosting provider dashboards<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4>Success in this position looks like:</h4><h4></h4></div><ul><li>Timely completion of ticket edits (3-6 hours for 90% of tickets)<br></li><li>Timely communication with customers on their questions and issues<br></li><li>Timely resolution or escalation of issues where appropriate<br></li><li>Up-to-date notes and information on customer records<br></li><li>You're fun to work with and everyone who works with you has a better day because of it<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><h4>What we expect:</h4><h4></h4></div><ul><li>Confident and positive engagement with the WP Buffs team<br></li><li>Active participation in WP Buffs internal team chat<br></li><li>Feedback and contribution to the team so we can all learn<br></li><li>Eagerness to learn<br></li><li>Transparency with workload or needs<br></li><li>Ability to turn constructive criticism into improved performance<br></li><li>You must be able to give feedback as well as take it.

Our datasets include tens of terabytes of content spread across multiple data centres, which can be quite challenging and time-consuming when developing features and products. Our team is tasked with designing and implementing a PaaS-like robust, distributed storage component that can easily be leveraged to speed up new user-facing features and products.</li><li>Session management service. Privacy is of great concern to Wikipedia’s communities. By isolating session management into a separate service, we are minimising the attack surface and increasing the security of our systems.</li><li>Event propagation and dependency tracking. While the number of direct edits is rather small, they can cause updates to several million pages at once. Hence, our infrastructure must be able to reliably update the databases and HTML representations and purge content from the caches at large scale. &nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Requirements</strong></strong></p><ul><li>You have experience building large-scale server applications.</li><ul><li>You think about clusters, caching and latencies</li><li>You are familiar with issues in large-scale systems and are eager to learn new technology</li></ul><li>You are familiar with a diverse set of programming languages and have a solid understanding of core engineering concepts:</li><ul><li>Unix process and concurrency models</li><li>Server application deployment and infrastructure automation</li><li>Relational &amp; distributed databases (e.g. MySQL, Cassandra, Riak, HBase, DynamoDB)</li><li>Principles of fault tolerance and security</li></ul><li>With freedom comes responsibility; you direct your own work and are proactive in seeking input</li><li>You have a scientific mindset and empirically test your hypotheses</li><li>BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or equivalent work experience</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Pluses</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Familiarity with Node.js</li><li>Experience with contributing to open source software and free culture</li><li>Self-organised, with experience in working in a geographically-distributed environment</li><li>You know what it means to be a volunteer or to coordinate the work of volunteers</li><li>Big ups if you are a contributor to Wikipedia and/or its sister projects</li></ul><p>Show us your stuff!

Our vision is a world in which every single human can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. We believe that everyone has the potential to contribute something to our shared knowledge, and that everyone should be able to access that knowledge, free of interference. We host the Wikimedia projects, build software experiences for reading, contributing, and sharing Wikimedia content, support the volunteer communities and partners who make Wikimedia possible, and advocate for policies that enable Wikimedia and free knowledge to thrive. The Wikimedia Foundation is a charitable, not-for-profit organization that relies on donations.

    "content": "*About us:*<br /><br />Charlie Casey (CEO) and Dave Clark (CTO) founded LoyaltyLion in 2012, with one clear mission: to help retailers succeed in the age of Amazon. They saw that retailers could never compete with Amazon on price or logistics. But they could offer a better customer experience. One that made customers feel valued, rather than like they were just another number. <br /><br />Getting to today wasn’t easy. The founders spent 12 months doing some serious bootstrapping – using a friend’s lounge as an office, renting the cheapest accommodation (it had no bathroom!) and taking government loans to make LoyaltyLion a success. Happy to say it’s paying off. <br /><br />Today, thousands of fast-growth ecommerce merchants use LoyaltyLion to power their loyalty programs and we have offices in the UK and the USA. <br /><br /><br />*Role:*<br /><br />As a Senior Customer Success Manager you’ll provide strategic loyalty advice to our largest clients (don’t worry, we’ll train you :). You’ll advise them on their launch strategy and how to optimise their programs over time. You’ll also work on renewals. <br /><br />Most of our clients are US based, so we are looking for someone to work US hours. The exact hours are negotiable, but something like 5pm to midnight, would be brilliant. We are flexible with working arrangements (ie. working from home, working part of the day in the office and the rest at home). <br /><br />You’ll be joining a team of three who are all passionate about customer happiness. We currently have exceptionally high customer retention because of the care and time we invest into our client relationships. We’re never satisfied though and we want you to come with your own ideas on how to offer the best post sale customer experience. <br /><br /><br />*Here are some of the activities you’ll be doing:*<br /><br />* Advising merchants on their loyalty launch strategy <br />* Speaking with merchants on a quarterly basis to provide loyalty recommendations<br />* Agreeing contract renewals <br />* Answering support queries when needed <br /><br /><br />*What we're looking for:*<br /><br />Someone who genuinely cares about customer happiness and goes above and beyond to help them succeed.  More about what we want:<br /><br />* Proven experience in software account management <br />* Natural multi-tasker<br />* Impeccable written English <br />* Professionalism in all areas of work<br />* Ability to build rapport, especially in difficult situations <br />* Willingness to work flexible hours - some of our clients are US based  <br />* Desire to make your mark in a fast growth startup<br /><br /><br />*What we offer:*<br /><br />* Opportunity to join a fast growth startup early and at an exciting time - we have doubled the team size in the past 6 months <br />* Flexible working arrangements<br />* Autonomy -  we encourage this<br />* Opportunity to make an impact - we’re a team of 20 so your efforts will make a visible change<br />* Solid existing team<br />* Warehouse office in central London with some great usual startup perks: free lunch Mondays, Beer Fridays, table football and the not so usual - HTC Vive - the best virtual reality in the world and an office favourite :)<br /><br /><br /><br />*To apply:* <br /><br />Please send your CV and a short cover email or apply via our company &quot;careers page&quot;:https://loyaltylion.com/jobs",

    "content": "We won’t lie. You will hear “What’s my login?” one trillion times, and you will have to say, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” with a straight face.<br /> <br />It’s not rocket science, which is why this helpdesk support role pays 30k not 300k, but we’ll throw in contributions to gym membership and a share of your first year’s new orders revenue.<br /> <br />You’ll be dealing with clients’ issues, from the first ticket to resolution. And, of course, you’ll be dealing with dummies who think toolkits are what Dad keeps in the garage, and who don’t know networks from nachos. That’s pretty much all you’ll do, day in, day out, so if you’d rather eat your own face than be polite to people every damn day, stop reading.<br /> <br />Still here? Cool. We also need you to document every step. So explain stuff to clients, and write it down. Officially, this is “retaining system knowledge”. Really it’s so when someone deletes the wrong thing and plunges of Europe into darkness, you can prove you didn’t tell ’em to do it.<br /> <br />To sum up so far:<br /><br />• Answer the damn phone or email, log the damn tickets and help the damn client.<br /><br />• Don’t swear or say stuff like “hybrid cloud” unless you want to freak them out.<br /><br />• Prioritise. If someone says, “I’ve deleted the wrong thing and plunged half of Europe into darkness,” put ’em ahead of someone whose Instagram is freezing.<br /><br />• Pass the buck. No, really. If you can’t resolve the issue, escalate it to Sales, Accounts, Management or upper line support. None of them will thank you for this, so buy them drinks when we go out, even though all of them will be paid more than you.<br /><br />• Maintain a knowledge base and suggest ideas for improvement. Keep these work-related for the probation period, then try asking for at-desk massages and in-house baristas. You won’t get them, but it’ll be slightly harder for us to fire you.<br /> <br />Don’t bother applying unless you have, or can convincingly lie about having:<br /><br />• one year’s experience on a technical and client-focused support desk.<br /><br />• one year’s customer service experience in any sector.<br /><br />• a logical approach to resolving functional and technical issues.<br /><br />• the ability to assess and document client issues, user experiences and processes.<br /><br />• a professional phone and email manner.<br /><br />• the ability to talk to people at different levels, with diverse backgrounds, without sighing or asking if they were dropped on their head as a baby.<br /><br />• experience of being accountable in a small team and the ability to work independently.<br /><br />• understanding of data protection and compliance principles, namely GDPR.<br /> <br />We need you to be organized, systematic, a good communicator, a problem-solver, proactive, reliable and able to prioritise. You need to know the Microsoft Office suite too – but, let’s face it, even your grandma can work Outlook, Word and Excel these days.<br /> <br />If you can do all that, you’re halfway through the door. If you can do all that, and you have experience of MS SharePoint (2010 and 2013), Zendesk, Targetprocess, remote assistance software and support portals, and conceptualising system frameworks and impacts, maybe those massages and baristas will happen.*<br /><br />*They won’t.<br /><br />Interested? please send us a CV and be sure to include a covering letter. That's right you don't go fishing without a hook. We look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />P.S. disclaimer time... we don't really think of end users as dummies - that was just parody.",
