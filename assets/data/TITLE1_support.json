You’d fit this role if you have a customer-centric mentality, and would like to help online shoppers have an awesome experience with their purchase.</p><p>Our Customer Experience Specialists work to put a real-life smile on customers’ faces by responding to their questions and concerns through email, chat, and social media. We believe that fast, accurate, comprehensive, and personalized messages make happy and loyal customers!</p><p>At SellerSmile,&nbsp;we work as a virtual team,&nbsp;sharing insights, staying in regular contact through online chat and video conferences. We share feedback, encourage each other to reach personal and professional milestones, and turn mistakes into opportunities for learning. We value clear communication, open-mindedness, enthusiasm, and the ability to anticipate and solve issues.</p><p><strong>You should apply if the following list describes you:</strong></p><ul><li>You’re agile.&nbsp;Change is the only constant in the modern business environment and you respond to that change with calculated speed. You attack problems with constant activity. You do more than most with vigorous persistence and endurance.</li><li>You love smiling.&nbsp;You want to exude the feeling of a smile with every conversation. You’re happy-go-lucky, empathetic, and light-hearted even in the face of negative circumstances. You leave the people that interact with feeling lighter and satisfied.</li><li>You’re mindful.&nbsp;Conscientious, dedicated, attentive, and empathetic. You anticipate customer and client needs and take every opportunity to be helpful. You strive to go the extra mile and reflect on our performance.</li><li>You’re independent.&nbsp;Self-governed, autonomous, and self-sufficient. As a remote professional, you are your own motivator and taskmaster. You don’t wait for others to find solutions and workarounds to barriers. You get to set your own pace without waiting for approval.</li><li>You’re liberated.&nbsp;Free, unrestricted, and flexible, you help our clients and our team members to rise above the “normal” existence where time, resources, and location are limited.</li><li>You’re ethical.&nbsp;You do the right thing even when it’s difficult, which imparts trust. You tell the truth when it’s not flattering or easy. You have a strong internal moral compass that directs us to act in ways that are right and cause the least harm.</li><li>You value empathy.&nbsp;You love to help! You can easily put yourself in a customer’s shoes and feel their anxiety. You realize that not everyone has the same skill set and that smart people sometimes make mistakes. You make customers feel empowered and not stupid because of a small mistake.</li><li>You pay attention to details.&nbsp;Sometimes customers may write emails that are a bit confusing. You pay attention to the finer nuances and context clues to determine what they need. You anticipate future problems and address concerns that may have gone unsaid. You understand the proper tone and language depending on the scenario. Maybe you have a “one emoticon” or “one exclamation point” rule of thumb for every email. You make sure each word and each punctuation mark makes people delighted to work with you.</li><li>You have strong written language skills.&nbsp;Almost everything at SellerSmile is done through text communication (both with customers and within our team). If you’re a user of Grammarly, we are looking for you! (Big plus&nbsp;if you are conversational in any other languages, our entire team is multilingual!).</li></ul><p><strong>Preferred qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience in an e-commerce setting.</li><li>Previous work history in customer service (online or brick &amp; mortar).</li><li>Proven ability to work independently. You’ll be communicating with the team primarily via online chat (Slack) and video calls. We understand that a remote lifestyle isn’t for everyone, it takes an advanced level of self-discipline.</li><li>Knowledge of helpdesk software such as Help Scout, Zendesk, Front, Intercom, etc.</li><li>Current use of productivity tools like Slack, Trello, Google Docs, Zoom, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>Things you might do with SellerSmile:</strong></p><p>SellerSmile is a small but fast-growing remote-first company, so you’ll likely get experience on many different projects while you work with our team. That said, here are some things you’ll probably do:</p><ul><li>Help customers through email or chat to ensure they have the best experience possible (teammates tend to send 60+ emails every day), helping research their problems and answering their questions.</li><li>Write documentation to share your knowledge with the team. Everything we create is written and maintained by the Customer Experience Specialists.</li><li>Work with the team to build processes and guidelines that will optimize and increase the quality of support at the same time.</li><li>Experiment: we’re a startup so we like to test new things often!h</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits of working with the SellerSmile team</strong></p><ul><li>100% remote.&nbsp;Work from anywhere with an internet connection!</li><li>Competitive pay.&nbsp;We don’t use remote as an excuse to pay less.</li><li>Flexibility.&nbsp;Take time away when you need it. Balance your business, pleasure, and personal lives!</li><li>Happy birthday.&nbsp;Mandatory holiday on your special day!</li><li>Results only.&nbsp;We care about getting the job done, not bureaucracy.</li><li>Fun. Work alongside a light-hearted but determined team.</li><li>Bonus $.&nbsp;Upgrade your home office + internet.</li><li>Growth.&nbsp;Join a profitable &amp; growing company.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.sellersmile.com/join-our-team/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Since At Home agents will assist DISH customers over the phone, personal disruptions such as but not limited to children playing, dogs barking, loud music, and non-work-related phone calls are not allowed during scheduled hours. Additionally, dependent care and other family obligations cannot interfere with job duties.<br><br> DISH reserves the right to inspect At Home workspaces to ensure business requirements are met. It is essential that At Home agents agree and understand that such inspections are necessary to ensure continuity of DISH’s business and excellent standards of customer service.<br><br> Team Environment<br> At Home agents will be members of a larger virtual team, with support from a supervisor. There will be additional resources available such as help desks and online tools. This is a structured environment and At Home agents will be provided a schedule they must adhere to.</p></div>",

You&rsquo;re likely working in a support role for some form of online platform, either currently remotely or with a desire to work remotely and flexibly.</p><br /><p>You will have guided customers through an entire customer service and support journey. That means you will have had the conversations needed to support someone through everything from being interested in a platform, to joining it, and to troubleshooting any difficulties they have, helping them make the most of a service.</p><br /><p>You will also be a seasoned champion of listening to customer feedback and turning anyone who may have had a negative experience into happy and loyal returning customers.</p><br /><p><em>Fancy a change?</em></p><br /><p>Does helping customers of a loyal, passionate online community sound like a good day at the 'office' to you?

    "content": "<h3> Remote Sales and Customer Champion </h3><div><div>Greenback Expat Tax Services is a company that specializes in preparing tax returns for Americans living overseas. We are a highly energetic, positive, resourceful team working virtually across the globe. We believe that executional excellence is key to success. We are currently seeking a talented, passionate, enthusiastic <strong>Sales and Customer Champion </strong>to join our team<strong>. </strong>As a business, our DNA and core is about excellence in customer experience plus we’re in a big period of growth for the business, so we see this role as one of the most integral ones on our team.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The role has two critical and interrelated, but distinct responsibilities. You need to be passionate, experienced and talented at both.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Customer Care:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</div><div>We call this role a “customer champion” for a reason- your role is to be the customer advocate and champion for our business. Good customer service seeks to understand a customer’s situation and help them resolve that situation at the first point of contact. Great customer service seeks to resolve that customer’s need, and translate that need back to the business to ensure that we improve- sometimes in tiny ways- and avoid any customer having a similar confusion moving forward.<em> Incredible customer service</em> does not just that, but seeks to listen to what’s not being said, read between the lines and take that back to make the experience better- for that customer and every one after that one. We believe our customers deserve incredible customer care. So, if you do too, and you love to help people, can’t stand the idea of anyone ever being confused or have anything other than a surprisingly delightful experience working with us, we’d love for you to apply.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Sales:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In the same way that we care deeply about customer experience, we also understand that in order to win that business, we need to earn the trust of prospective customers. That’s not easy (nor should it be!). We know that when someone starts the process of engaging a tax preparer, they may feel anxious, they may feel frustrated, and they may dread the process. Taxes aren’t at the top of their list, and they need us to make it easy for them, but also make them feel confident that we are in control of their tax needs. The right sales person doesn’t just answer a question, but help to really explain and articulate what makes Greenback special and why we’re a great fit compared to other alternatives. The right sales person can speak intelligently about taxes, about how we work, about the strength of our accountant team and do so in a genuine, not pushy way. Timeliness, appropriate feedback, good knowledge of the industry as well as our internal process are all critical to the role.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Last- but certainly not least- we’re looking for someone who’s a great fit for our company culture. We’re a small, tight knit team- all of us working remotely from home offices. We’re growing fast (check us out on the INC 5000 list- whoohoo!). We’re obsessive about customer experience, believe that planning is the key to success, and like to work hard and make things happen- but also live our lives outside of the (home) office too! We’re looking for someone who is confident, reliable, an excellent communicator, loves working in a fast-paced team, and is able to get things done with minimal supervision (we don’t like looking over your shoulder- and don’t think you’d like that either).&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Key skills needed:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Excellent communication skills (does that go without saying?). You will mostly be speaking with people via email (80%), with some phone calls (20%). You need to be able to read between the lines and craft messaging that is warm, friendly, professional and really meets the need of the specific demands of that email interaction.&nbsp;</li><li>The ability to convert warm leads at a high volume by setting proper expectations, providing thoughtful responses, and clearly outlining next steps.&nbsp;</li><li>Ability to identify opportunities to add value by monitoring industry changes, trends and customer needs.&nbsp;</li><li>Use analytics to manage and measure your success, know where to put additional effort, and prioritize. That means you need to be someone who can manage to targets, metrics, and can analyze these metrics, understand what they mean, and make good decisions as a result.&nbsp;</li><li>Excellence in execution: Attention to detail and ability to keep organized/juggle multiple things at once. We're a seasonal business, so there are times when our inboxes are on fire! This is part of the role, and being organized, handling stress well and being able to juggle high demand situations comes with the territory.&nbsp;</li><li>We don’t expect you to be an accountant, but you will need to learn and become a subject matter expert on US expat taxes.&nbsp;</li><li>Bonus: current or former expat, or someone who appreciates or gets excited about the expat life.&nbsp;</li><li>Time zone: we’re looking for someone who is in a fixed time zone +/- 2 hours from GMT. We’re not looking for long term travelers/people who aren’t in the same time zone most of the year.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div>What we offer:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>The opportunity for you to work with highly talented, communicative, make-it-happen people who also love adventure.</li><li>&nbsp;Very generous time off policy.&nbsp;</li><li>4 weeks of Paid Parental Leave at 100% of your salary!&nbsp;</li><li>We have an excellent benefits package that includes a 401k plan (with company match), medical, vision, and dental coverage (We pay 75% of your premium) and short-term disability (We cover 100% of the cost)!&nbsp;</li><li>Annual team trip (this year: San Diego, last year: Playa del Carmen, Mexico)&nbsp;</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Apply today!!! To apply, please visit:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We ONLY accept applications via our website here: https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/jobs/remote-sales-and-customer-champion/&nbsp;</div></div>",

If you’ve never been in some sort of personal development program where coaching played a part (either you being the coach or being coached by someone else), you will not be considered (sorry!).&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Structure of the role<br></strong><br>The customer support role is split, more or less, into three thirds:<br><br></div><div>The first third is fielding customer support issues as they come in. Generally via email, though sometimes we take the initiative to call and knock it out over the phone (in our business, customers are often really stoked to hear from a real person!).</div><div><br>The second third is making ourselves available for demos, help sessions, consultations (affectionately referred to as hand holding sessions, these are where we get to shine by letting our customers get to talk to and be guided by A REAL PERSON).</div><div><br>The third third is where we have time and bandwidth to do things above and beyond just reacting to incoming needs and requests. This is when we do outreach to our customers (affectionately dubbed “doling out customer love”), improve and expand our learning resources (like writing articles and making help videos), and take on other sorts of projects to further our mission to serve coaches.</div><div><br>Each of these thirds affords opportunities to shine and excel, and gives a lot of variety from day to day plus opportunities to learn. The third third in particular is ripe for you to bring your creativity and have your voice heard to make lasting contributions.</div><div><br><strong><br>Structure of the position<br></strong><br></div><div>The position is full-time, 40-45 hours per week during business hours in North America. On average about 2 of these hours per week will be over the weekend to cover incoming support issues. The position is remote, though may occasionally require commuting for in-person demos and meet ups, and several times a year entails travel for conferences and in-person work with the team (er, when things settle down with this whole COVID-19 thing, ahem!). You must be a US resident.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Compensation and Benefits</strong><br><br></div><div>Because our team is so small, it is vitally important for us to find the right fit in adding number three. Therefore the first two months is a test period during which you’ll be an hourly contractor earning $30/hour. You can start full time to begin or we can be flexible to allow you to ramp up as needed to assist with your transition.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>After two months if we agree this is a Good Thing™, congratulations! That’s what we’re going for and you will then be offered a full-time salaried position starting at $60,000 per year. As a salaried employee vacation benefits apply: holidays plus THREE weeks off per year. Your discretionary paid time off is earned pro rata as you go starting from your official employment hire date.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>After two months as a salaried employee, the following additional benefits kick in:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>$100 monthly fitness allowance ($1200 per year)</li><li>$500 per year continuing education allowance (to learn ANYTHING you want, doesn’t need to be job related; we know that curious and happy employees are the best kind)</li><li>$50 monthly internet/phone allowance ($600 per year)</li><li>QSEHRA health insurance premium reimbursement benefit of up to $5,150 per year for self-only employees ($429.17 per month) and $10,450 per year for employees with a family ($870.83 per month)</li><li>SIMPLE IRA 100% match of up to 3% of salary (3% of $60,000 is $1800)</li></ul><div><br>Cash value of these benefits maxed out: $1200 + $500 + $600 + $5150 + $1800 = <strong>$9250<br></strong><br></div><div>Total compensation adds up to <strong>$69,250 + 3 weeks paid vacation</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Requirements and Applying<br></strong><br>Again, you need to have some sort of coaching experience to be considered. <strong>Please do not apply if you don’t have that.</strong></div><div><br>Have that sort of background?
