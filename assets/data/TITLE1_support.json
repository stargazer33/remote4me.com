We guarantee 15-20 hours per week with an hourly pay of between $25/hr. and $45/hr., depending on the In-Home Usage Test project. No experience required. <br><br>American Consumer Panels is a consulting firm that specializes in product testing and product development work. We design and conduct In-Home Usage Testing (IHUT) locally and nationally to provide actual user feedback to companies and market research firms to evaluate products, packaging, related product instructions and more. <br><br>We leverage our network of private panels (In-Home Usage Testers) to provide product testers to companies for evaluating the in-home experience with a wide variety of products to ensure proper product certification and greater market access. <br><br>Please note that although this job can be done from home 95% of the time, very occasionally In-Home Product Testers may be asked to visit the client's office, laboratory, store, warehouse or factory for training or meetings (visits are local and scheduled at no more than 20 minutes drive from the In-Home Usage Tester address). These optional visits are also paid by the hour. <br><br>During your application process, we will determine your consumer profile and establish what products would be suitable for you to test according to your demographics, lifestyle, consumer behavior, skills, hobbies and ability. Research questionnaires are used to identify and target certain types of consumers, to ensure the right participants are engaged and to achieve the representative sample needed. Job candidates for In-Home Usage Testing are also screened to meet the client s needs for the project to ensure that the product is one that they qualify to test and that they have a balance of demographics and attitudes. <br><br>Participation in these product testing and consumer panels is always free, secure and private. In-Home Usage Testing is a quick, easy and fun way to make extra cash by telling big brands what you think about their upcoming products and services in the American market.<br><br>Main duties: <br><br> Sign and return non-disclosure agreements before the product to be tested is shipped. Individuals who complete the required documents will have the products sent to their homes.<br><br> Once the product is received for In-Home Usage Test (IHUT), the Product Tester must take care of the product being tested and use it responsibly.<br><br> Read and strictly follow the In-Home Usage Test Daily Schedule provided with each product testing project. In-Home Usage Test Daily Schedules may include tasks to do such as: unpacking, reading instructions, journal entries, online or mobile feedback, usage of product for certain amount of time, writing reviews, taking pictures, etc.<br><br> Properly document In-Home Usage Test as instructed in the In-Home Usage Test Daily Schedule.

Our team works remotely from all over the world.</div><div><br></div><div>Our sole focus is building an application called <a href='https://www.cliniko.com/' rel='nofollow'>Cliniko</a>. Cliniko makes life easy for Allied Health professionals by handling appointment scheduling, storing treatment notes, and a bunch of other things. It's quite a neat system and is used globally by tens of thousands of people every day.</div><div><br></div><div>Things we love to do:</div><ul><li>Provide great software and service.</li><li>Work with talented people.</li><li>Delight our customers.</li><li>Make the world a little bit better.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>How we work</strong></div><div>We work smarter, not harder. We think work/life balance is important and we work a 30-hour week as standard (you still get a full-time pay; it’s a full-time position).</div><div><br></div><div>Even though we're based out of Melbourne, Australia, our team is spread around the world. We want to hire the best person available, not just the best person within a 10km radius. You can see our team's locations on the <a href='http://www.redguava.com.au/' rel='nofollow'>Red Guava</a> website (admittedly that site is a bit neglected, so it's kind of how our team looked a couple of years ago).</div><div><br></div><div>If you want to know more about how we work (which really is quite different), our founder Joel gave a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_2jXqzxBNU' rel='nofollow'>talk</a> about it.<br><br><strong>Great work environment</strong></div><div>We want people doing their best work with us. We know that needs a great work environment, and we don't just mean a flashy office. Some things we do a little differently to enable people to do their best work and live a happy life:</div><ul><li>30-hour work week.</li><li>Complete autonomy.</li><li>Work from anywhere.</li><li>Unlimited annual leave (minimum 4 weeks per year).</li><li>Supplied computer equipment.</li><li>Ergonomic furniture.</li><li>Fresh organic fruit weekly to your home.</li><li>Overseas trips for full team meet-ups (family invited and paid for too).</li><li>No managers.</li><li>No meetings.</li></ul><h3>The job</h3><div>We are looking for someone amazing to join our customer support team. This doesn’t mean you need to have 5+ years experience in the industry, we care about skill, passion, and integrity much more than credentials.</div><div><br></div><div>Even though we generally have very flexible work hours, always having someone around to chat with our customers is also pretty important for us. So for this role, we'd need you to be able to work mostly 9AM to 3PM MST (roughly 4PM to 10PM UTC) weekdays.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Who you are</strong></div><div>As a young child you had an epiphany where you realised other people actually exist in their own right, they aren't just cameo appearances in your story. This helped build the empathy and eagerness to help others that you have today.</div><div><br></div><div>You have superb English skills (both verbal and written). You are able to take your thoughts and put them together in easy to understand language. You're able to convey your messages in a friendly, accurate, and jargon-free way. You appreciate a good oxford comma.</div><div><br></div><div>You want to work in a place where you can do your best work and have fun too. You want to constantly improve.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What you'll work on</strong></div><div>You’ll spend your time supporting Cliniko customers. This includes:</div><ul><li>Responding to chat/email messages from existing customers.</li><li>Helping people decide if Cliniko would suit their business.</li><li>Voice calling customers when chat isn't enough or it's requested.</li><li>Communicating with people via social media.</li><li>Writing bug reports to share with our developers.&nbsp;</li><li>Working with third party integrators to solve customer problems.</li><li>Engaging in peer review feedback to help others improve.</li><li>Anything else you think needs doing.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Our goal is to &quot;do right by our customers&quot; in every single interaction, so you'll be empowered (and expected) to provide amazing support.<br><br><strong>In summary</strong></div><div>Let’s be clear, you do need to be seriously amazing. We don't hire often and when we do, we get hundreds of applicants. We will offer you the best job you have ever had with plenty of perks, but we expect you to be super-talented.</div><div><br></div><div>You should be absolutely passionate about providing amazing support. You should take pride in your work and be excited to do it.<br><br><br><strong>Job applications close 16th of October, 2019.</strong></div></div>",

    "content": "<p><strong>SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE </strong></p><br /><p>OLIO is the world&rsquo;s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and our mission is to solve the problem of food waste in the home &amp; local community. We do this by connecting anyone with spare food &ndash; which can be households or local businesses &ndash; with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away &pound;800 of food each year - collectively adding up to &pound;15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile &amp; web apps.</p><br /><p>Over the past 4 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. We now have 1.3 million users who have together shared well over 2.3 million portions of food&ndash; with food being successfully shared in 49 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our Food Waste Heroes programme, with over 5,000 registered Food Waste Hero users who rescue food from local businesses, take it home and shared it with their neighbours via the OLIO app. OLIO is now looking for an intern to join the core team as we embark upon the next exciting phase in our journey.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITY &ndash; LONDON and REMOTE</strong></p><br /><p>To support the OLIO team and OLIO Food Waste Heroes, we are recruiting for a Food Waste Hero Support intern. You will report into Anna Lopez-Fujimaki, Food Waste Hero Supply &amp; Support Associate.</p><br /><p>The Food Waste Heroes (FWHs) programme involves OLIO matching small groups of waste-busting volunteers with their local street food market, farmers&rsquo; market, shop, café, bakery, deli, greengrocer, hotel or restaurant. Once matched, the FWHs provide a service by collecting any unsold surplus food at the end of the day. Food Waste Heroes then use the OLIO app to re-distribute the saved food within their local community.</p><br /><p>In this role you will be responsible for:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Supporting the OLIO Food Waste Hero Community on a broad range of topics (sharing on OLIO, food safety, Food Waste Hero registration and training, reaching out to local businesses) via a broad variety of channels (social media, email, customer service software, WhatsApp, telephone)</li><br /><li>Supporting the OLIO Food Waste Hero team with admin tasks as needed, such as registering participating food businesses on the OLIO systems and ensuring compliance with OLIO&rsquo;s policies</li><br /><li>Responding to volunteers&rsquo; emails using HelpScout (customer service software)</li><br /><li>Stepping in to rescue and redistribute food to the local community (London only, if London-based) as and when needed to stop good food from going to waste and to maintain food business donor relations</li><br /></ul><br /><p>All of our roles are remote working roles, however for London based team members there is the ability to co-work as well. We live for our mission, but like to have fun along the way!</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>IS THIS YOU? </strong></p><br /><p>Our ideal internship candidate will first and foremost be as passionate about our mission as we are! In addition to this, you will have the following experience and skills:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Projects, university or voluntary work in the field of social good or environmentalism</li><br /><li>A high level of organisational skills and attention to detail</li><br /><li>Articulate and extroverted, with the ability to explain things in simple terms</li><br /><li>Confident working with people from all walks of life </li><br /></ul><br /><p>And all OLIO team members share these attributes:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>A self-starter with a &lsquo;can-do&rsquo; attitude o Resourceful and creative</li><br /><li>Thorough, but able to move quickly and decisively</li><br /><li>A ruthless ability to prioritise</li><br /><li>Excellent communication skills</li><br /><li>Fun to work with ☺</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><em>PLEASE NOTE: This is an unpaid internship for fully enrolled university students who want to put theory into practice and see the inside of a fast-growing start-up.

We&rsquo;ve built the UK&rsquo;s first real-time pay-by-mile car insurance policies with a smart driving app, bringing the same level of on-demand convenience to car ownership that people now expect from taxis and take-away food.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We launched in the UK in July 2018 and our highly-engaged member base is growing quickly, so we&rsquo;re expanding our&nbsp;<a href='https://www.customerserviceexcellenceawards.co.uk/2019winners' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>award-winning</a>&nbsp;team to support our policyholders with excellent customer service. We&rsquo;re on the lookout for a bright, creative and driven team player to help support a growing online community of customers and build a refreshing new brand in the car insurance space.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You can read a little more about us on the&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fbusiness-45758926' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>BBC</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.driving.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fpay-drive-car-insurance-now-offered-uk%2F' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>The Times</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://www.telegraph.co.uk/insurance/car/could-save-money-car-insurance-paying-drive/' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>The Telegraph</a>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autoexpress.co.uk%2Fcar-news%2Fconsumer-news%2F100067%2Fuk-s-first-pay-per-mile-car-insurance-launches' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>Auto Express</a>.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>ABOUT YOUR ROLE:</strong></p><br /><p>This role is a full-time position and would suit someone keen to work a flexible 5 day week on a rota, with the availability to sometimes swap your working hours or working days. We'd be looking for someone that would be able to work into the evening (sometimes up until 9/10pm), and was also available to work at the weekend. Remote working is something we could definitely consider after you've passed your first 2 months with us.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be a skilled, versatile writer and a natural communicator with a friendly and professional phone manner and a keen eye for detail. You&rsquo;ll be as comfortable using emojis as you are with semi colons, and while you&rsquo;re disciplined enough to stick to a script when needed &ndash; you should have the wit and charm to rewrite it too (when appropriate). It would help if English is your first language, but this is certainly not essential.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be proactive, upbeat and able to work both with a team and independently to solve problems and come up with new ways to keep our customer base happy. It would be ideal if you have proven experience in a customer service or support role and you get a kick out of helping improve processes to make our customer experience the best it can be.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Your day-to-day will involve answering and resolving customer queries through our in-app messenger, on the phone, on social media or via email. You may be required to do some simple data management and analysis, so a basic grasp of Excel would be handy. Technology is at the core of everything we do, and you may often have to speak with our development team to get to the bottom of issues, so it will help if you have an active interest in tech too.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>It&rsquo;s worth saying that working in an early stage startup will mean that no two days are ever the same, so the ideal candidate will relish the opportunity to get stuck in and won&rsquo;t be afraid to learn new things &ndash; appreciating that their job description is only the tip of the iceberg. There may sometimes be late nights and early mornings, but we'll have a lot of fun along the way.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>If you see this as a positive challenge and a chance to grow quickly within a role that has the potential to be whatever you make it, then you should definitely think about joining our team to help us change car insurance forever.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>YOU&rsquo;LL NEED</strong>:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>A degree in English Literature or Language, Creative Writing or similar or relevant experience in a communications or customer service role</li><br /><li>Great verbal, written and general communication skills</li><br /><li>Excellent attention to detail</li><br /><li>To be organised, process-driven and comfortable working to tight deadlines</li><br /><li>The passion and drive to succeed in a startup environment</li><br /><li>A positive outlook, patience and a good sense of humour</li><br /><li>Knowledge and experience of using social media</li><br /><li>Proficiency in Microsoft Office, particularly Excel</li><br /><li>A keen interest in technology and a desire to understand our product inside out</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>BONUS POINTS IF YOU</strong>:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Have experience of managing people (either one person or a whole team)</li><br /><li>Have had any exposure to VOIP systems or call centre switchboards</li><br /><li>Have experience of using live chat software (like Intercom), and CRM tools (like Zendesk)</li><br /><li>Have experience dealing with complaints and disputes</li><br /><li>Have experience in working with insurance claims</li><br /><li>Have experience of working in a regulated industry</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What will you get in return?</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>A competative salary package with excellent growth opportunities</li><br /><li>A&nbsp; chance to work in a lively supportive environment, where no two days are the same.</li><br /><li>A chance to be part of the UK fastest growing insurer, as one of our very earliest members of an <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.customerserviceexcellenceawards.co.uk%2F2019winners' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>award-winning</a> team.</li><br /><li>Opportunities to advance your career in any direction.

    "content": "<h3><b> Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept:</b></h3> &nbsp; <p>Join our passionate team of top-notch experts to solve a real-world problem, and help people spend less time managing expenses and more time pursuing their real goals. As we revolutionize the way people manage their expenses, being part of the Expensify team means building the easiest, fastest, and most efficient platform to automate everything expense-related. </p><p>We‘ve expanded into the UK market and set up shop in London. Help shape the team that will launch our global domination of expense reports and maintain a standard of excellence around the world.</p><p>Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most talked about perk is our <a href='https://we.are.expensify.com/explore-the-world' rel='nofollow'>Offshore</a> where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we’re going to Vietnam, do you want to join?</p><h3>About The Job</h3><p>As a Success Coach, you’ll focus on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems that we integrate with.  Our customers come in all shapes and sizes and we do our best to make them as happy as possible (read: phenomenal support is the name of the game). When our product changes, you’ll be the point of contact for our customers via email, in product announcements, phone calls and (occasional) in-person visits.</p><h3>About You</h3><p>Joining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and ever changing work environment. You’re fearless and relish in big challenges, working within the grey and making it concrete and clear. You’re entrepreneurial, you love supporting customers and helping them solve complex problems -- all with the ease of a trapeze artist! You’re a digital expert and love interacting with customers through email, chat, and sometimes over the phone.  Because Expensify is a simple product that connects to a variety of deceptively complex financial systems, you’re also someone who is comfortable wading in the complicated waters of accounting and simplifying it for our customers.</p><p>For the best possible fit, we’re looking for someone who can:</p><ul><li><p>Articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about the product implications of a new feature, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem. The ideal candidate will be able to clearly articulate themselves in each scenario.</p></li><li><p>Maintain customer happiness and problem solve on their behalf by providing clear and friendly written and verbal communication.</p></li><li><p>Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things move quickly in this environment and it’s crucial that you are able to react to new information and re-prioritize accordingly.</p></li><li><p>Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we're all learning things as we go. We also love anyone who's able to effectively train colleagues as we grow the team.</p></li><li><p>Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company day to day, even if it may be repetitive sometimes and not so glamorous. #oneteamonedream</p></li><li><p>Support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. Make no mistake, this role is grounded in customer support, no matter the customer size.</p></li><li><p>Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly, but it is only possible with in-depth product knowledge and a deep understanding of the problem that the customer is trying to solve.</p></li><li><p>Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, not required!</p></li></ul><h3>What We Offer</h3><ul><li><p>Full-time, salaried position</p></li><li><p>Employer match to retirement pension</p></li><li><p>100% of the premiums for Dental and Medical insurance</p></li><li><p>Free lunch</p></li><li><p>Flexible vacation policy</p></li><li><p>Last, but far from least, the company spends 3 weeks abroad as a team</p></li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are many ways to do that, but the easiest way to help us out is by answering the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren't successful addressing their concerns, why not?</p></li><li><p>Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?</p></li><li><p>If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?</p></li><li><p>What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?</p></li><li><p>How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</p></li></ol><h3>Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href='mailto:jobs@expensify.com' rel='nofollow'>jobs@expensify.com</a>. We're excited to hear from you!</h3> ",

Our product is a performance feedback platform rolled out company-wide from the intern to the CEO. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives, organize one-on-one meetings, and to praise each other for a job well done</div><div>We’ve got a very <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/customer-team' rel='nofollow'>strong customer team</a> in place that we’re now looking to grow with a friendly and proactive customer success manager who is keen to work full-time remotel<br><br><br></div><h3>What you’ll do</h3><div>Our ultimate CS goal is that customers are happy and renew without hesitation. Our process is built on creating personal relationships with clients, educating them, and relaying their feedback and needs into the product roadmap. You’ll focus on the US eastern time zones, helping out with EU and PST clients clients too.<br><br></div><div>As a successul CS manager, you will</div><ul><li>Help customers during the onboarding process, ensuring they know the product and what kinds of processes can work best for their business</li><li>Lend a hand when customers need support. Advanced tickets will be handled by our support team, but clients really appreciate it when they have a single contact for most questions.</li><li>Reach out to your customers on a regular cadence, and set up 30-minute calls to learn about their challenges, to suggest improvements to their processes, and to share product news with them</li><li>Collect all the knowledge and track it in our CRM, and share the highlights (or lowlights) inside the CS team but also with product management or even company-wide</li><li>Reach out to clients in time, and ensure their renewal is something they look forward to!</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Once you got the hang of it, there’s a lot more you can get involved with:</div><ul><li>Make suggestions on how to improve our internal processes, and the product itself</li><li>Join feature development projects and represent the customer perspective</li><li>Rally customers for early-access testing, and relay back the feedback you receive</li><li>Find novel ways to help customers get more value. Collaborate with marketing, or development, or product, or sales, or support, and get things done</li></ul><div><br>You’re expected to think outside the box – anything that helps making clients more successful is fair game. We don’t lock clients into long term contracts, and we never overpromise during the sales process, so it’s very rewarding work. At the same time we definitely need to be on our toes and truly help clients, as they can literally leave any time and get their money back.</div><div><br></div><h3>Who we’re looking for</h3><div><strong>5 years of experience in comparable roles helping customers with B2B software:</strong> Our product is a web-based SAAS solution, so experience in customer success or account management with comparable online products is a must. Ideally you’ve worked on two or more products before.<br><br></div><div><strong>You are business-savvy:</strong> You see customer renewal as a top priority, and your goal is to keep churn low. You’re comfortable to prioritize, so that as many customers as possible are as likely to renew as possible.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Experience with remote work:</strong> There are many advantages to working from home: No commute, flexible location, and more. It’s not as if you’ll be entirely on your own — we communicate constantly using Hangouts, Slack, and Confluence. (Plus we’ll fly you over to Berlin once a year.) Our satellite workers are of the self-driven, comfortably autonomous variety though. So if you are naturally a self-starter and very proactive about keeping everyone in the loop, you’ll fit right in!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Process passion:</strong> You get excited at improving processes. You’ve seen lots of approaches already, and can really contribute to our processes and make them better. You’re highly structured and will prepare diligently and take copious amounts of notes about customers and their needs afterward.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Technical plus charming:</strong> You need to be tech-savvy and a fast learner, as our product is complex and supports a wide range of HR practices. At the same time, you just <em>have</em> to love people and interacting with them. You need to be an overall positive person, and your glass should always be half-full.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Willingness to go the extra mile:</strong> It’s not about making calls as quickly as possible. It’s about really helping clients, and that might involve researching or mulling over something for a few days, and then getting back to the customer once you have an even better idea/suggestion/workaround later on</div><div><br>Prior experience in HR- related topics is a major plus, and general interest in the topic is a must.<br><br><br></div><h3>More reasons to work at SI</h3><ul><li>We’re international: We’re based in Berlin and sell mainly to the US, Australia and the UK. Our staff of 35 hails from 16 countries (all our written communication is in English)</li><li>We're self-funded — our only &quot;investors&quot; are our amazing <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/customers/' rel='nofollow'>customers</a> who have helped us grow our customer base largely through word of mouth.</li><li>We invest in our people. You’ll get a learning &amp; development budge and days off for attending conferences</li><li>We’re serious about our open and tolerant company culture, and we believe diversity makes our culture and our product better.</li><li>We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales. Also, there are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!</li><li>You’re invited to visit our Berlin head office for three weeks once a year and we cover the costs. Take an <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/office-tour/' rel='nofollow'>office tour</a>.</li><li>We want to do well by doing good, so we turn down dodgy clients and <a href='https://startup.small-improvements.com/lets-good-donations-2017/' rel='nofollow'>donate 2% of our profits</a> to charity.</li><li>And we love to travel! <a href='https://vimeo.com/293382390' rel='nofollow'>Take a look at our last company trip</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>",

We’re looking for an empathetic, efficient problem solver who loves to make people’s day. This role will be a remote-based role keeping Pacific Time hours (9am-5pm Pacific Time).</p><p>Empathetic, passionate support-people love working at Mystery.org, because our elementary teacher and homeschool customers are raving fans of our product, and because ours is a company where customer issues get solved at the root, and quickly, so support is less about apologizing, and more about saying,&nbsp;<em>yes we can</em>! Our customer experience specialists work remotely and all (five currently) have been with us for at least a year, forming an engaged, positive team. We don’t just handle typical support requests; we also help with inside sales efforts, and our more experienced team members have become a go-to resource for a wide range of company projects. This is a great opportunity for empathetic, energetic people who want to grow with us as we scale to help us reach millions of children, at school and at home.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><ul><li>Do you have two or more years of experience delighting customers by solving their problems, and caring for them in a friendly, fun and professional way?</li><li>Are you a strong, empathetic, friendly communicator–both verbally (via phone or Zoom), and in writing?</li><li>Do you have experience with managing a high volume of different types of tasks using systems (such as ZenDesk, CRMs, or email/Slack), and creating approaches that allow you to move fast, while maintaining meticulous attention to each important detail?</li><li>Do you thrive on variety and regularly learning new things, in a school-year driven setting where ticket types change along with the seasonal needs of the teachers and administrators we support?</li><li>Are you happy to work from your home office, keeping Pacific Time hours (9 am – 5 pm)?</li><li>Are you uniquely motivated by our mission?</li></ul><p><strong>Day-to-day</strong></p><p>In this role you’ll report to our Director of Communication, Heike Larson. As a Customer Experience Specialist, your primary focus will be solving our customer’s problems. Mostly, we respond to customer inquiries via email–helping customers with a wide range of questions, from what lesson to teach next, to how to trouble-shoot video issues, from which of our membership levels to choose, to how to submit a purchase order. However, you’ll also answer inbound phone calls, and support our district partnership team with outbound calls to school or district admins to follow up on quotes they created, or emails that bounce.</p><p>In your daily work, you’ll be using a wide range of systems: ZenDesk, Slack, Asana, Zoom, in addition to the Google suite and our in-house CRM and content management system.</p><p>As you join, we’ll train you on all aspects of this job: we’ve got a robust wiki with training resources and best practices, in addition to a seasoned team eager to help you get up-to-speed. Once you’re on top of all ticket types and know Mystery well, you may also have the opportunity to work on projects for other teams in the company.</p><p>This is an opportunity to help more kids stay curious and become the next generation of problem solvers. While your work will be remote from your home office, we meet daily via Zoom as a team, and have weekly company-wide town halls. Plus, we all get together near our San Francisco office for our semi-annual offsites.</p><p><strong>Package &amp; Perks</strong></p><p><strong>If you’re looking for the basics:</strong></p><ul><li>$4M in funding from leading education investors (and we’re already profitable)</li><li>Competitive salary</li><li>Equity in a high-growth company</li><li>401K, health care, vacation</li><li>Customers who love us</li></ul><p>…but the real perks of working at Mystery.org are the quality of the people on your team and the problem we’re solving.

We&rsquo;re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our mission. We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.</p><br /><p>Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 30 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Shanghai, Singapore, Romania and North America. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.</p><br /><p>Winnow&rsquo;s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow has now worked with hundreds of sites to reduce food waste, including hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and high street restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for operations.</p><br /><p>As the global leader in addressing food waste, we are committed to continue pushing the envelope on what technology can do to solve this problem. Winnow Vision, our new artificial intelligence-based technology, is trained to automatically track all food waste thrown away. It has won awards at the World Economic Forum and has been received tremendous enthusiasm from our clients and the industry.

With our customers, we challenge them if we don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re achieving their goals, whether they be environmental or financial.</p><br /><p><strong>People of action.</strong>&nbsp;Done is better than perfect, and we learn by boldly doing then rapidly improving. We&rsquo;re breaking new ground, so we know things might go wrong. But we judge ourselves and each other on our reaction and our resilience.</p><br /><p><strong>Bound by food.</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re a diverse bunch, but our belief in the value of food is the common thread in everything we do. With each other, we celebrate through our love and respect for food. With our customers, it means we work hard to develop creative tools to make it easy for chefs to value food.</p><br /><p><strong>Hungry and humble.</strong>&nbsp;Our product is revolutionary, our people are impressive, and we&rsquo;re hungry for change. But, we&rsquo;re just the catalyst for a bigger movement. We stay humble regardless of our success, and make chefs the heroes in this journey.</p><br /><p>This is an opportunity to join a rapidly growing start-up (and one of Wired&rsquo;s top 100 start-ups in Europe) and help us propel our growth at what is truly the most exciting and dynamic points in time in our business.

We’re looking for an empathetic, efficient problem solver who loves to make people’s day. This role will be a remote-based role keeping Pacific Time hours (9am-5pm Pacific Time).</div><div><br>Empathetic, passionate support-people love working at Mystery.org, because our elementary teacher and homeschool customers are raving fans of our product, and because ours is a company where customer issues get solved at the root, and quickly, so support is less about apologizing, and more about saying, <em>yes we can</em>! Our customer experience specialists work remotely and all (five currently) have been with us for at least a year, forming an engaged, positive team. We don’t just handle typical support requests; we also help with inside sales efforts, and our more experienced team members have become a go-to resource for a wide range of company projects. This is a great opportunity for empathetic, energetic people who want to grow with us as we scale to help us reach millions of children, at school and at home.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>About You</strong></div><ul><li>Do you have two or more years of experience delighting customers by solving their problems, and caring for them in a friendly, fun and professional way?<br><br><br><br></li><li>Are you a strong, empathetic, friendly communicator--both verbally (via phone or Zoom), and in writing?&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></li><li>Do you have experience with managing a high volume of different types of tasks using systems (such as ZenDesk, CRMs, or email/Slack), and creating approaches that allow you to move fast, while maintaining meticulous attention to each important detail?<br><br><br></li><li>Do you thrive on variety and regularly learning new things, in a school-year driven setting where ticket types change along with the seasonal needs of the teachers and administrators we support?<br><br><br></li><li>Are you happy to work from your home office, keeping Pacific Time hours (9 am - 5 pm)? &nbsp;<br><br><br></li><li>Are you uniquely motivated by our mission?&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Day-to-day</strong></div><div><br>In this role you’ll report to our Director of Communication, Heike Larson. As a Customer Experience Specialist, your primary focus will be solving our customer’s problems. Mostly, we respond to customer inquiries via email--helping customers with a wide range of questions, from what lesson to teach next, to how to trouble-shoot video issues, from which of our membership levels to choose, to how to submit a purchase order. However, you’ll also answer inbound phone calls, and support our district partnership team with outbound calls to school or district admins to follow up on quotes they created, or emails that bounce.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>In your daily work, you’ll be using a wide range of systems: ZenDesk, Slack, Asana, Zoom, in addition to the Google suite and our in-house CRM and content management system.&nbsp;</div><div><br>As you join, we’ll train you on all aspects of this job: we’ve got a robust wiki with training resources and best practices, in addition to a seasoned team eager to help you get up-to-speed. Once you’re on top of all ticket types and know Mystery well, you may also have the opportunity to work on projects for other teams in the company.<br><br><br></div><div>This is an opportunity to help more kids stay curious and become the next generation of problem solvers. While your work will be remote from your home office, we meet daily via Zoom as a team, and have weekly company-wide town halls.

First round phone interviews: 23rd &amp; 27th August 2019</p><br /><p><strong>Start date:</strong>&nbsp;Immediate</p><br /><p><strong>Location:</strong>&nbsp;London, Oxford, or Remote (England)</p><br /><p><strong>Hours:</strong>&nbsp;Full time, Monday-Friday 11:00 &ndash; 19:30</p><br /><p><strong>Salary:</strong>&nbsp;&pound;22,000-&pound;25,000 p.a</p><br /><p><strong>How to apply:</strong>&nbsp;Please email your CV and cover letter in PDF format. Applications without these will not be considered.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - Why</strong>&nbsp;Like it or not, funding plays a critical role in a schools ability to deliver a great education, and we are unfortunately facing a funding cut crisis in the UK, the scale of which hasn&rsquo;t been seen since the WW2. This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve. Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours. Across the UK, connected communities are simply not happening. This is where School Space comes in.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - How</strong>&nbsp;Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays. We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the centre of a thriving community. School Space - Team Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 7 years, and recent success includes investment raises, 30 partner schools, over half a million generated for them. We&rsquo;ve been on the Techstars 2018 Cohort, been nominated for Social Enterprise UK&rsquo;s Social Enterprise of the Year, and picked up a few awards and amazing networks along the way. Our team are committed to the nth degree and full of the belief that social business is the model of the future. We have endless determination to see School Space grow fast and well, scaling our impact across the UK and beyond. In the mix we have Oxbridge graduates, marathon runners, a pilot, industry veterans, an Olympic torch bearer and a man who once ran a marathon with no training/trainers for an onion bhaji.</p><br /><p><strong>The Role</strong>&nbsp;<strong>- Why</strong>&nbsp;We have grown our customer base of wonderful community members hiring our school spaces - and we need amazing, motivated people to help ensure they have a good experience. This is the second hire in this role, as we work towards offering our customers constant support with their experience hiring our venues.</p><br /><p><strong>The Role - How</strong>&nbsp;Key responsibilities include:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Problem solving for our customers, speaking directly with them via email<br />and phone to find a solution to their need (be it positive or negative<br />feedback).</li><br /><li>Proactively spotting patterns in the frustrations or hopes of our customers,<br />seeing where we can change our processes, tools, or product to make them<br />happier.</li><br /><li>Working with our operations team (who manage our school relationships)<br />to ensure we can solve the customer&rsquo;s problems on the spot, and for the<br />future.</li><br /><li>Understanding, prioritising and escalating our customers&amp;#39; feedback and<br />requests to the rest of the team (sales, product development and<br />operations.)</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What we want from you:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills</li><br /><li>A love of customers/people in general and an ability to empathise with their<br />problems, build rapport and leave them satisfied with the solution.</li><br /><li>Resilience - the ability to deal with and thrive on people coming to you with<br />things that are going wrong!</li><br /><li>Strong attention to detail</li><br /><li>Curiosity - you should love investigating awkward problems, getting to the<br />root cause and fixing them</li><br /><li>The ability and desire to work in a fast-paced, challenging environment with<br />peers who challenge you to constantly improve</li><br /><li>An eagerness to take on more responsibility, and you thrive on change - we<br />are a start up and that means things are fast moving.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do<br />not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual<br />orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</p>",

Our Software as a Service (SaaS) applications run on desktops, mobile devices, and campground check-in kiosks.</p><p>We are an intentionally small company based in Mount Juliet, TN and take our time finding the right people who believe in our mission. For us, this is not just a job – it’s our passion! We take pride in our work and “own our own stuff.” We work hard to be proactive and solve problems. But most importantly, we get what good customer service looks and feels like. We either add value to the market by making campground management and reservations easy, or we find something else to do.

A person who provides useful, forward-thinking solutions and has the ability to explain complex technology in easy-to-understand language. Someone who can see the forest and the trees. And finally, someone who is genuinely cool, has an open spirit, is willing to learn and wants work to feel meaningful and fun.</p><p>Still reading?
