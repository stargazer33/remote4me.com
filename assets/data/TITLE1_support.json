You will join the support rotation, and take on an agreed number of evening and weekend support hours (compensated both in money and time). While the ongoing Snowplow Insights support commitment is the first priority, our Support Engineers will regularly take full days to work on projects that are strategic for the Support team or wider company.</p><br /><p>Being in the European timezone, you will have regular opportunities to interact with the wider company, including at Snowplow&rsquo;s office in London, our company Away Weeks and at our various meetups across Europe.</p><br /><p><strong>The environment you&rsquo;ll be working in</strong></p><br /><p>Our company values are Transparency, Honesty, Ownership, Inclusivity, Empowerment, Customer-centricity, Growth and Technical Excellence.

    "content": "<h3> Customer Support Specialist </h3><div><div>Welcome ! <br><br>Demio is currently hiring a <strong>part-time Support Specialist</strong> (we call them Success team members) to join our mission to help businesses leverage the power of personal conversations at scale.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Demio is a hassle-free webinar platform built for marketers. With our platform, companies can generate leads, filter prospects, perform group demos, engaging sales presentations, integrate with their CRM, view advanced webinar reporting, track conversions, and more. It’s truly unlike any other product on the market.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We’re looking to bring on that someone special right now to join the team part-time (... and yes, we're hoping that's you... keep reading to see ).&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We want to be joined by someone that shares our same vision for a product-centric and customer-centric business. Someone who understands that customer support is not just about answering questions, but about guiding users to success. Someone that is willing to join us on our journey to change the way that businesses communicate, market, and sell online. Someone that is process-oriented and driven by seeing customers succeed.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As a young startup (we almost hit our 3 year launch anniversary), we have tons of amazing users and are adding new great companies every single month.&nbsp; A wonderful product experience is our primary focus here at Demio... from the customer support to the onboarding process, to the platform itself, we're working hard to make it all a delightful experience.&nbsp;<br><br>While the webinar, web-communication space has been around for a&nbsp; while and continues to grow, we believe that we’re creating an entirely new segment in the market and doing it in a simple way.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>About the Position:</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Our team is small, but nimble . We have 5 success team members, 4 engineers, a QA team member, product manager, and 2 founders. As a company, we love to employ and work with great people, and we're hoping you might be the right addition to our amazing team to join us on our big new initiatives and steps forward!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>While we (the founders) are based in Tampa, FL, we’re dedicated to building our company with a remote-based work environment meaning our entire team is remote, and we are happy to offer the ability to work from <strong>anywhere</strong> in the world through our systems in Slack, Clubhouse, Intercom, Notion and GitHub. We'll do everything we can to make a stress free, easy to navigate operation inside so your role is just as simple as our platform!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Not only will you be remote, but you get to work with a team that is hungry, smart, and eager to make an impact. As a major member of that team, your work will never go unnoticed. Your work will <strong>always</strong> make large waves in the company.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>But hey, we also like to have fun ; we understand that building a company is quite the journey, and it can be incredibly hard, so we believe that it’s important to enjoy the moments along the way (mimosa Friday’s, anyone? )&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>About You:</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We want someone to join our team who truly desires to make an impact, is empathetic, loves communication, is courteous, and is constantly striving to grow/improve. Of course, being remote means you won't be micro-managed and you should be highly responsible for your actions, be reliable, focused on output and results and understand that great companies are built one small step at a time.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>There are no requirements for past experience in Customer Success. </strong>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>If this position interests you, then definitely apply (details below)!&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>Some of our most amazing team members have grown into the role based on their drive and personal goals. We'd love to help you here too if that's you!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>We would expect you to have:</strong>&nbsp;</div><ul><li>&nbsp;Ability to work remotely with your own computer and high-speed internet connection (can travel and work - just need to make sure you'll be set up!)<br>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Ability to communicate with fluent English to our users<br>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Tech-savvy ability enough to communicate technical details and guide users through our software (training will be provided, but must have the ability to understand basic concepts)<br>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Ability to handle sometimes tough conversations with users with a smile (or emoji)<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Ability to handle (rare) stressful situations with high ticket volume<br>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Real excitement to see customer wins, successful webinars run, and great feedback&nbsp;<br><br><br></li><li>&nbsp;The drive to learn and grow every day</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>What does the average day look like in Demio? Imagine this:&nbsp;</strong></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>Log in to your Slack app when you start the day and high five the team already on ! Our team is all over the world, but we're always overlapping hours working together to innovate and move the company forward.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Review any development updates in Slack or Carrot from your teammates on internal updates, urgent tickets, new bug fixes, or what's going on in the company for that day. Communication is always key here in a fast moving company!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Log into Intercom and review the conversations going on for the day and see if anything should be reviewed prior to starting your shift. You can check in with any other team members of any urgent tickets and organize your priorities to make yourself successful for the day.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Our weekly success meeting will outline what we can expect for the week, any new initiatives, and bugs we’re expecting to be crushed. If we have any backlogged conversations, you can start tackling those and following up with users.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Inside of the Intercom help desk, we’ll be doing live chat and email responses to help our users succeed with Demio! That means quickly diagnosing priority on tickets, understanding customer use cases, and product issues.&nbsp; Sometimes that means ringing up the engineering team or making tickets and sometimes that might mean jumping on a product call with a user to help them get unstuck.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>It'll be important that you keep communication strong with the success team (especially during transitions) on what’s going on and where!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Then, you can high five your teammates again when you log off and update the team in Slack with your daily update!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Once a week, we'll review the tickets as a team, review team KPI’s and review any major issues (plus we’ll meet monthly to look where to improve for better internal systems across the company). And if it’s a Friday, we might pop a few beers (or mimosas) together on Demio and cheers to a great week!&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>More about the position:</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We’re expecting this to start as a Saturday part-time shift for our team. This shift would start at 9 am EST - 5 pm EST on Saturday and 8pm - 11pm EST from Monday to Friday. Ideally, you may be on Central time or on European time to match hours that fit your schedule.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We’re open to any time zone, as long as you can fulfill it!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The payment for this position will be based on experience and your background, but we’ll be very transparent on our initial calls if this is a fit.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Growth-oriented bonuses we believe in:</strong>&nbsp;</div><ol><li>Minimum 2 Weeks Paid Vacation</li><li>Reimbursement for Kindle Ebooks/Audible</li><li>Paid Access to Digital Courses for extended training</li><li>Gym Membership reimbursement</li><li>Reimbursement for 1 local event a month</li><li>Meditation, Yoga, or Massage reimbursement</li><li>Working with a truly mission-driven team motivated by excellence</li><li>Huge room for growth&nbsp;</li></ol><div><br><strong>What to do next:</strong>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>If this sounds exciting to you, and you think working with an awesome startup company sounds great, let’s talk.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Shoot us a reply to <a href='mailto:hiring@Demio.com' rel='nofollow'><strong>hiring@Demio.com</strong></a><strong></strong>with #DriveToSucceed in your subject line, and we’ll set up an interview.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Here’s what we’ll ask for in the email:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>1. A short overview of why you think Demio might be the right fit for you&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>2. A résumé is cool but not necessary, feel free to include any and all recommendations from past colleagues or employers (LinkedIn works :D )&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>3. Tell us about you personally, stuff you’re into – what your goals are, where you are in life and where you want to be in life. This may not be your dream job, but who knows maybe we can work together to help it become so!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>4. What’s your favorite book?&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>5. <strong>BONUS</strong>! Include a video of yourself telling us a little bit about yourself – just post it on Vimeo/YouTube/etc. This will greatly increase your chances of an interview! :)&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Take your time to articulate your thoughts, there’s no prize for submitting quickly. </strong>No need to write everything, but this is a great way for us to learn about your ability to communicate and be thoughtful.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>That’s it ! We look forward to meeting you!&nbsp;</div></div>",

Education stipend. Will purchase a computer for you.</p><p></p><p>This is a 100% Remote position.</p><p>We may have an annual meeting in LA, Seattle, or somewhere else- which we will fly you in for.</p><p>Working on Eastern Standard Time is preferred.</p><p>We have a 1-hour weekly meeting and that’s it. The rest is just ad hoc communications as needed. We work collaboratively to make sure customers succeed and are happy.</p><p>Here’s the good news. You will be busy 7 months of the year and not busy 5 months of the year. We can either shift your work to marketing related activities in the down time, or you can simply take that time off (unpaid vacation) while maintaining your benefits.</p><p>Peak work months are December through April, September and October. That means you could be free to roam the world or tend your garden for May, June, July, August, and November.</p><p>We all have lives outside of work. We like trading jokes and chatting during the day while we work. Topics include travel, sports, pop culture, and lots of memes.</p><h5><strong>What you will Do</strong></h5><p><strong>Core Activities #1: Help Customers Succeed.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Taxes and cryptocurrency can be complicated. ­­­­Our customers will need help navigating our application, 3rd party applications like cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, and then some help understanding accounting and tax issues. Customers will need help creating simple spreadsheets or making adjustments to their account. We offer support by phone, email, and chat. We reply during evenings and weekends. We are very polite to our customers, who are often stressed. However, we don’t let them walk all over us. We are professionals and we expect to be treated as such.</p><p></p><p>We view Customer Success as a key part of how we grow our business. Many customers refer their friends and accountants. We form business partnerships based on the strength of our customer service too. So, during peak tax seasons, it’s all hands on deck as we deal with hundreds of customers during a very stressful time for them. So, you will see the executive team and senior developers helping basically on a 24/7 cycle in late December, March, April, and October.</p><p></p><p>This position will require quick, efficient communication. You’ll have to learn and understand how our software works, how cryptocurrency works, how taxes and accounting works, and how people work. You’ll have to listen carefully and solve problems. Sometimes you’ll have to apologize or ask for forgiveness. Often, you’ll get effusive praise from happy customers and they’ll offer to tip you or take you out for drinks. You’ll have to learn a lot of new things and problem solve. Be prepared to talk about your experience doing this on a regular basis.</p><p></p><p><strong>Core Activity #2: Product Development</strong></p><p>We are constantly trying to learn. So, you will be taking customer feedback so we can make everyone’s lives easier. You can also update our instructional materials to help customers and reduce your own workload</p><p></p><p>A background in accounting, tax, or fintech saas tech support is great. If you want to learn something new by attending a conference, buy a book, or purchasing an online course- we’ll pay for that.</p><p></p><p><strong>Core Activity #3: Marketing</strong></p><p>If you chose to work the full year and help with marketing, we have a number of activities around writing articles, copywriting, social media, and video production.</p><h5><strong>In this role you will:</strong></h5><p>-Develop deep knowledge of the ZenLedger software and Crypto Tax treatments and standards</p><p>-Partner with our customers to effectively assess and resolve issues through chat, email and phone support</p><p>-Answer “how to” questions and help customers navigate a variety of features in ZenLedger</p><p>-Diagnose and report software issues along with UI/UX and customer navigation issues and engage with our product and engineering teams using established processes to ensure customer success</p><p>-Communicate thoughtful, customized solutions that help customers quickly and accurately report and file their Crypto Taxes</p><p>-Show composure, resilience, and flexibility as customer needs evolve and case volume fluctuates</p><p>-Work is performed under limited supervision with considerable latitude for the use of initiative and independent problem solving</p><h5><strong>We are looking for people who:</strong></h5><p>-Find creative problem solving fulfilling and challenging</p><p>-Are self motivated and eager to learn</p><p>-Thrive in a dynamic and collaborative environment and are self starters</p><p>-Adapt quickly and respectfully to changing priorities and customer needs</p><p>-Have a clear, professional, and informative communication style</p><h5><strong>Who You Will Work With:</strong></h5><p>Pat Larsen, CEO. US Air Force Academy grad, Chicago Booth MBA. Experience in M&amp;A investment banking, Amazon, and startups.</p><p>Bryan Starbuck, CTO. UCSD comp sci grad.&nbsp; Bryan worked for 10 years at Microsoft. He has since worked on his own startups as the CEO/CTO with 3 exits, including TalentSpring and Assurance (2019, $2.3B).</p><p>Dan Hannum, Director Business Development. Univ South Carolina, MBA. Dan was a Venture Capital analyst and worked in TD Ameritrade’s Ultra High Net Worth client practice. He has been a crypto investor since 2013.</p><h5><strong>Customer Testimonials</strong></h5><p>We hold ourselves to a very high standard when working with customers to earn their trust.</p><p>Here are some of my favorite testimonials:</p><p>“I re-stated my taxes from 2013 using ZenLedger and found $235,000 in overpayment to the</p><p>IRS”</p><p></p><p>“I refiled my 2017 crypto trades for the second time with the IRS and got an email from the IRS</p><p>criminal investigation division informing me that they had a case open on me but were now</p><p>going to close it. Dodged a bullet there. Glad I used your software.”</p><p></p><p>“I had no idea how complicated tax reporting for cryptocurrencies would be. You have a</p><p>customer for life.”</p><p></p><p>“Not only have I told my friends, but my CPA loves the software!”</p><p></p><p>“Most of the others in our 14-member investment group are techies and we all use ZL. Myself</p><p>and my dad, are the weak link. Your team and product saved us. Toast to you.”</p><p></p><p>“Again, thanks for your product. If you ever make it to the Bay area, hit me up. I have two</p><p>kegerators on the back deck overlooking the estuary. I owe you at least a good German beer.”</p><p></p><p><strong>Location</strong>: US or Canada</p>        </div><div>        <a href='mailto:hello@zenledger.io?subject=Application%20via%20Customer%20Success%20Specialist%20listing%20on%20https%3A%2F%2Fremote.co' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

    "content": "<h3> Customer Support Representative </h3><div><div>Help us make work a better place! We provide 750 companies worldwide with a feedback platform so their employees can learn from each other and grow professionally. SoundCloud, Zapier, Strava, Duolingo and many more use our SAAS solution company-wide — from the intern to the CEO.<br><br></div><div>We're looking for a friendly and proactive customer support representative who is keen to work full-time remotely. You’ll cover the US eastern time zones, thus linking our Berlin-based development HQ and our <span>US based Customer team</span>. You’ll answer tough questions from our clients’ administrators, provide feedback on customer experience to the development team, and help us make our clients successful.<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>Who we are</strong></h3><div>We’re a <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/' rel='nofollow'>company of 35 people in Berlin and the US</a>. Our product is a performance feedback platform rolled out company-wide from the intern to the CEO. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives, organize one-on-one meetings, and to praise each other for a job well done.<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>What you'll do</strong></h3><div>The customer support role is mainly about helping clients when they run into questions or bugs with the product, but there are also aspects of customer success, sales, marketing and account management. It’s a perfect fit for a well-rounded person that likes workplace flexibility and variety.</div><div><br>To provide support coverage, you’ll need to be located in the CST or EST time zones.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Key tasks will be:</strong></div><ul><li>Timely responses to the online support tickets filed by our clients. We respond to all customers within 24 hours, with a typical response time within 1 hour from when the customer emails.</li><li>We primarily use email, but we jump on the phone and host screen sharing sessions on demand. Talking with our customers on the phone is a core part of this role. It won't be daily, but you'll be asked to provide coverage for customer success and sales by helping customers and prospects with tool functionality over the phone. You'll be trained on demonstrating the product as we also sometimes represent our company at industry conferences.</li><li>Working very closely with our sales, marketing and customer success team to develop key accounts and help customers succeed long term. As an example this could include working on cross-team projects like marketing promotions or webinars.</li><li>Collecting product feedback, as well as engaging in feature discussions. It’s important to us to improve the product based on the common questions we get from clients, and support is core to this mission.</li><li>Updating our customer facing documentation. Support’s ownership of our help guides is key to helping customers learn our tool, and you’ll work closely with marketing on those efforts.</li><li>Troubleshooting bugs and working closely with developers to manage a reported bug from start to finish. You use system logs, test and replicate reported bugs in your test environment, as well as work closely with engineers to update or troubleshoot with customers and track system issues on Github.</li></ul><div><br></div><h3><strong>Who we're looking for</strong></h3><div><strong>1+ years of experience supporting B2B SaaS software:</strong> our product is a web-based SaaS solution, so experience in customer support with comparable online products is a must.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Familiar with online support tool sets:</strong> you should be familiar with online support software like Helpscout, CRMs like Hubspot, and tools like Trello or Github.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>You write well:</strong> most communication does happen in writing, so it’s important that you get your message across with clarity and ease to a diverse international audience. We also rely on Slack to communicate across the organization, so an ability to communicate effectively over text is essential.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>You aren’t afraid to jump on the phone:</strong> although we primarily use email, you should also be comfortable helping customers over the phone while delivering a professional and engaging phone presence for our customers.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Experience with remote work:</strong> there are many advantages to working from home: no commute, flexible location. Our satellite workers are of the self-driven, comfortably autonomous variety though. So if you are naturally a self-starter with excellent time management skills, work with a low level of direction, and remain very proactive about keeping everyone in the loop - you'll fit right in.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Technical plus charming:</strong> you need to be tech-savvy and a fast learner, as our product is complex and contains some very technical aspects. It’s not uncommon to troubleshoot a customer issue using system logs or work with APIs. &nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>You pay attention to detail:</strong> our product is very broad <em>and</em> deep, and customer inquiries can be quite tricky. You need to be able to pick up small details in support tickets, and also read between the lines. High attention to detail is core to this position and an essential daily skill to remain successful.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Willingness to go the extra mile:</strong> it’s not about answering tickets as quickly as possible. It’s about answering questions as <em>successfully</em> as possible and spending extra effort to point out even better solutions. Our customers can reach out with tough questions or bugs, so it’s important to think like the customer and propose helpful solutions and workarounds.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>You have an entrepreneurial and growth mindset: </strong>you are curious and motivated to learn more about our product, industry, and your own growth on a continuous basis. You have a high-energy approach to work, an eagerness to learn, and raise opportunities for improvement with your manager, team, or the entire company.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Ideally, <strong>you have a strong interest in HR and the future of work</strong> (and previous experience in the space). Our customers include some of the most innovative and forward thinking people and culture leaders around the world, and this is definitely a plus for someone to be successful in this role.<br><br></div><h3><strong>More reasons to work at SI:</strong></h3><ul><li>We’re international: We’re based in Berlin and sell mainly to the US, Australia and the UK. Our staff of 35 hails from 16 countries (all our written communication is in English)</li><li>We're self-funded — our only &quot;investors&quot; are our amazing <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/customers/' rel='nofollow'>customers</a> who have helped us grow our customer base largely through word of mouth.</li><li>We invest in our people. You’ll get a learning &amp; development budge and days off for attending conferences</li><li>We’re serious about our open and tolerant company culture, and we believe diversity makes our culture and our product better.</li><li>We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales. Also, there are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!</li><li>You’re invited to visit our Berlin head office for three weeks once a year and we cover the costs. Take an <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/office-tour/' rel='nofollow'>office tour</a>.</li><li>We want to do well by doing good, so we turn down dodgy clients and <a href='https://startup.small-improvements.com/lets-good-donations-2017/' rel='nofollow'>donate 2% of our profits</a> to charity.</li><li>And we love to travel! <a href='https://vimeo.com/293382390' rel='nofollow'>Take a look at our last company trip</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>",

    "content": "<span></span> <span><h4>Snowplow Analytics</h4></span> <br> <h3>Support Engineer UTC 2</h3> <div>  <div>   \\nSupport Engineer \\nRemote, up to UTC +/- 2 \\n\\nOur Snowplow Insights offering has grown significantly over the last year, and we now orchestrate and monitor the Snowplow event pipeline for nearly 200 customers, many of them processing billions of events per month. The support that we provide to our customers is a core part of the Snowplow Insights offering, and we strive to provide the best technical support of any analytics vendor.\\n\\nWe have implemented a full “follow the sun” support model at Snowplow, with our six Support Engineers working in six well-distributed time zones (East &amp; West Coast US, Canada, Spain, Portugal, Russia). We are now looking to hire an additional Support Engineer in a central European timezone, in the UTC +/- 2 time zone range.&nbsp;\\n\\nThis is a Support Engineering role - not a Support Agent role. We are looking for candidates who can learn, troubleshoot and explain the many complex technical systems that make up the Snowplow offering. We expect you to have an analytical mind, a high level of customer empathy and an enthusiasm for improving processes and systems. Depending on where your passions lie, there is a path from Support Engineering at Snowplow into Customer Success, Implementation Services, Tech Ops or Engineering.\\n\\nResponsibilities for our Support Engineer will include\\n\\n\\n* Handling customer tickets in Zendesk, resolving if possible or escalating further to our Customer Success, Implementation Services, Tech Ops, Engineering or Product teams.\\n\\n* Handling Snowplow pipeline incidents in OpsGenie, communicating the failure to our customers and either resolving if possible, or working with the customer and/or Snowplow teams to resolve.\\n\\n* Providing help to the open-source Snowplow community in our Discourse forums.\\n\\n* Working with customers on regular support tasks including: upgrading their Snowplow pipelines; sharing security best practices; enabling new Snowplow features for their account.\\n\\n* Creating playbooks, documentation and software to reduce your support workload even as we add more customers.\\n\\n* Collaborating with Snowplow teams on bug fixes and new features for both our open source projects and our proprietary orchestration and monitoring technology.\\n\\n* Constant awareness of open and ongoing issues and actively checking and updating open tickets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExcellent customer support is at the core of Snowplow’s commercial offering. You will join the support rotation, and take on an agreed number of evening and weekend support hours (compensated both in money and time). While the ongoing Snowplow Insights support commitment is the first priority, our Support Engineers will regularly take full days to work on projects that are strategic for the Support team or wider company.\\n\\nBeing in the European timezone, you will have regular opportunities to interact with the wider company, including at Snowplow’s office in London, our company Away Weeks and at our various meetups across Europe.\\n\\nThe environment you’ll be working in\\n\\nOur company values are Transparency, Honesty, Ownership, Inclusivity, Empowerment, Customer-centricity, Growth and Technical Excellence. These aren’t just words we plucked out of thin air, we came up with them together as a company and are continually looking to find new ways to weave these into our day to day operations. From flexible hours and working locations to the way we give feedback, we’re passionate about building a company that supports both company and individual development.&nbsp;\\n\\nWe’d love to get to know you if\\n\\n\\n* Data or programming is your thing! This role would be a great fit for somebody who has completed an analytically rigorous degree or programming bootcamp, or has experience in programming, QA or other automation.\\n\\n* You enjoy helping people. You communicate with clarity and empathy.\\n\\n* New programming language? You’re on it! You have a broad technical curiosity and proven technical understanding.\\n\\n* Broader business challenges interest you. Snowplow customers are highly technology- and&gt;I have an idea! You have a passion for problem solving.\\n\\n* Can we automate? Yes, we can. You will be constantly working with customers and internal Snowplow teams to solve Snowplow Insights problems in as effective, time-efficient and repeatable way as possible - you must love troubleshooting.\\n\\n* Process makes perfect. You have a mature attitude to security, documentation and process.\\n\\n* Reliability is key. Snowplow Insights customers trust us with their event pipelines and AWS and GCP accounts - this is a huge responsibility and informs everything we do.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat you’ll get in return\\n\\n\\n* A competitive package, including share options\\n\\n* 25 days of holiday a year (plus bank holidays)\\n\\n* MacBook or Dell XPS 13/15\\n\\n* Freedom to work wherever suits you best&nbsp;\\n\\n* Two fantastic company Away Weeks in a different European city each year (the next one is in Bratislava in November!)\\n\\n* Work alongside a supportive and talented team with the opportunity to work on cutting edge technology and challenging problems\\n\\n* Grow and develop in a fast-moving, collaborative organisation&nbsp;\\n\\n* Convenient location in central London (Shoreditch)\\n\\n* Continuous supply of Pact coffee and healthy snacks in the office when you’re here!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSnowplow is dedicated to building and supporting a brilliant, diverse and hugely inclusive team. We don't discriminate against gender, race, religion or belief, disability, age, marital status or sexual orientation.

The support that we provide to our customers is a core part of the Snowplow Insights offering, and we strive to provide the best technical support of any analytics vendor.<br><br>We have implemented a full “follow the sun” support model at Snowplow, with our six Support Engineers working in six well-distributed time zones (East &amp; West Coast US, Canada, Spain, Portugal, Russia). We are now looking to hire an additional Support Engineer in a central European timezone, in the UTC +/- 2 time zone range.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a Support Engineering role - not a Support Agent role. We are looking for candidates who can learn, troubleshoot and explain the many complex technical systems that make up the Snowplow offering. We expect you to have an analytical mind, a high level of customer empathy and an enthusiasm for improving processes and systems. Depending on where your passions lie, there is a path from Support Engineering at Snowplow into Customer Success, Implementation Services, Tech Ops or Engineering.<br><br><strong>Responsibilities for our Support Engineer will include</strong></p><ul><li>Handling customer tickets in Zendesk, resolving if possible or escalating further to our Customer Success, Implementation Services, Tech Ops, Engineering or Product teams.</li><li>Handling Snowplow pipeline incidents in OpsGenie, communicating the failure to our customers and either resolving if possible, or working with the customer and/or Snowplow teams to resolve.</li><li>Providing help to the open-source Snowplow community in our Discourse forums.</li><li>Working with customers on regular support tasks including: upgrading their Snowplow pipelines; sharing security best practices; enabling new Snowplow features for their account.</li><li>Creating playbooks, documentation and software to reduce your support workload even as we add more customers.</li><li>Collaborating with Snowplow teams on bug fixes and new features for both our open source projects and our proprietary orchestration and monitoring technology.</li><li>Constant awareness of open and ongoing issues and actively checking and updating open tickets.</li></ul><p>Excellent customer support is at the core of Snowplow’s commercial offering. You will join the support rotation, and take on an agreed number of evening and weekend support hours (compensated both in money and time). While the ongoing Snowplow Insights support commitment is the first priority, our Support Engineers will regularly take full days to work on projects that are strategic for the Support team or wider company.</p><p>Being in the European timezone, you will have regular opportunities to interact with the wider company, including at Snowplow’s office in London, our company Away Weeks and at our various meetups across Europe.</p><p><strong>The environment you’ll be working in</strong></p><p>Our company values are Transparency, Honesty, Ownership, Inclusivity, Empowerment, Customer-centricity, Growth and Technical Excellence. These aren’t just words we plucked out of thin air, we came up with them together as a company and are continually looking to find new ways to weave these into our day to day operations. From flexible hours and working locations to the way we give feedback, we’re passionate about building a company that supports both company and individual development.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We’d love to get to know you if</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Data or programming is your thing!</strong> This role would be a great fit for somebody who has completed an analytically rigorous degree or programming bootcamp, or has experience in programming, QA or other automation.</li><li><strong>You enjoy helping people.</strong> You communicate with clarity and empathy.</li><li><strong>New programming language?

    "content": "<p><strong>SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE </strong></p><br /><p>OLIO is the world&rsquo;s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and our mission is to solve the problem of food waste in the home &amp; local community. We do this by connecting anyone with spare food &ndash; which can be households or local businesses &ndash; with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away &pound;800 of food each year - collectively adding up to &pound;15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile &amp; web apps.</p><br /><p>Over the past 4 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. We now have 1.3 million users who have together shared well over 2.3 million portions of food&ndash; with food being successfully shared in 49 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our Food Waste Heroes programme, with over 5,000 registered Food Waste Hero users who rescue food from local businesses, take it home and shared it with their neighbours via the OLIO app. OLIO is now looking for an intern to join the core team as we embark upon the next exciting phase in our journey.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITY &ndash; LONDON and REMOTE</strong></p><br /><p>To support the OLIO team and OLIO Food Waste Heroes, we are recruiting for a Food Waste Hero Support intern. You will report into Anna Lopez-Fujimaki, Food Waste Hero Supply &amp; Support Associate.</p><br /><p>The Food Waste Heroes (FWHs) programme involves OLIO matching small groups of waste-busting volunteers with their local street food market, farmers&rsquo; market, shop, café, bakery, deli, greengrocer, hotel or restaurant. Once matched, the FWHs provide a service by collecting any unsold surplus food at the end of the day. Food Waste Heroes then use the OLIO app to re-distribute the saved food within their local community.</p><br /><p>In this role you will be responsible for:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Supporting the OLIO Food Waste Hero Community on a broad range of topics (sharing on OLIO, food safety, Food Waste Hero registration and training, reaching out to local businesses) via a broad variety of channels (social media, email, customer service software, WhatsApp, telephone)</li><br /><li>Supporting the OLIO Food Waste Hero team with admin tasks as needed, such as registering participating food businesses on the OLIO systems and ensuring compliance with OLIO&rsquo;s policies</li><br /><li>Responding to volunteers&rsquo; emails using HelpScout (customer service software)</li><br /><li>Stepping in to rescue and redistribute food to the local community (London only, if London-based) as and when needed to stop good food from going to waste and to maintain food business donor relations</li><br /></ul><br /><p>All of our roles are remote working roles, however for London based team members there is the ability to co-work as well. We live for our mission, but like to have fun along the way!</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>IS THIS YOU? </strong></p><br /><p>Our ideal internship candidate will first and foremost be as passionate about our mission as we are! In addition to this, you will have the following experience and skills:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Projects, university or voluntary work in the field of social good or environmentalism</li><br /><li>A high level of organisational skills and attention to detail</li><br /><li>Articulate and extroverted, with the ability to explain things in simple terms</li><br /><li>Confident working with people from all walks of life </li><br /></ul><br /><p>And all OLIO team members share these attributes:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>A self-starter with a &lsquo;can-do&rsquo; attitude o Resourceful and creative</li><br /><li>Thorough, but able to move quickly and decisively</li><br /><li>A ruthless ability to prioritise</li><br /><li>Excellent communication skills</li><br /><li>Fun to work with ☺</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><em>PLEASE NOTE: This is an unpaid internship for fully enrolled university students who want to put theory into practice and see the inside of a fast-growing start-up.

So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

We&rsquo;ve built the UK&rsquo;s first real-time pay-by-mile car insurance policies with a smart driving app, bringing the same level of on-demand convenience to car ownership that people now expect from taxis and take-away food.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We launched in the UK in July 2018 and our highly-engaged member base is growing quickly, so we&rsquo;re expanding our&nbsp;<a href='https://www.customerserviceexcellenceawards.co.uk/2019winners' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>award-winning</a>&nbsp;team to support our policyholders with excellent customer service. We&rsquo;re on the lookout for a bright, creative and driven team player to help support a growing online community of customers and build a refreshing new brand in the car insurance space.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You can read a little more about us on the&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fbusiness-45758926' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>BBC</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.driving.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fpay-drive-car-insurance-now-offered-uk%2F' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>The Times</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://www.telegraph.co.uk/insurance/car/could-save-money-car-insurance-paying-drive/' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>The Telegraph</a>&nbsp;and in&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autoexpress.co.uk%2Fcar-news%2Fconsumer-news%2F100067%2Fuk-s-first-pay-per-mile-car-insurance-launches' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>Auto Express</a>.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>ABOUT YOUR ROLE:</strong></p><br /><p>This role is a full-time position and would suit someone keen to work a flexible 5 day week on a rota, with the availability to sometimes swap your working hours or working days. We'd be looking for someone that would be able to work into the evening (sometimes up until 9/10pm), and was also available to work at the weekend. Remote working is something we could definitely consider after you've passed your first 2 months with us.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be a skilled, versatile writer and a natural communicator with a friendly and professional phone manner and a keen eye for detail. You&rsquo;ll be as comfortable using emojis as you are with semi colons, and while you&rsquo;re disciplined enough to stick to a script when needed &ndash; you should have the wit and charm to rewrite it too (when appropriate). It would help if English is your first language, but this is certainly not essential.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be proactive, upbeat and able to work both with a team and independently to solve problems and come up with new ways to keep our customer base happy. It would be ideal if you have proven experience in a customer service or support role and you get a kick out of helping improve processes to make our customer experience the best it can be.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Your day-to-day will involve answering and resolving customer queries through our in-app messenger, on the phone, on social media or via email. You may be required to do some simple data management and analysis, so a basic grasp of Excel would be handy. Technology is at the core of everything we do, and you may often have to speak with our development team to get to the bottom of issues, so it will help if you have an active interest in tech too.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>It&rsquo;s worth saying that working in an early stage startup will mean that no two days are ever the same, so the ideal candidate will relish the opportunity to get stuck in and won&rsquo;t be afraid to learn new things &ndash; appreciating that their job description is only the tip of the iceberg. There may sometimes be late nights and early mornings, but we'll have a lot of fun along the way.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>If you see this as a positive challenge and a chance to grow quickly within a role that has the potential to be whatever you make it, then you should definitely think about joining our team to help us change car insurance forever.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>YOU&rsquo;LL NEED</strong>:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>A degree in English Literature or Language, Creative Writing or similar or relevant experience in a communications or customer service role</li><br /><li>Great verbal, written and general communication skills</li><br /><li>Excellent attention to detail</li><br /><li>To be organised, process-driven and comfortable working to tight deadlines</li><br /><li>The passion and drive to succeed in a startup environment</li><br /><li>A positive outlook, patience and a good sense of humour</li><br /><li>Knowledge and experience of using social media</li><br /><li>Proficiency in Microsoft Office, particularly Excel</li><br /><li>A keen interest in technology and a desire to understand our product inside out</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>BONUS POINTS IF YOU</strong>:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Have experience of managing people (either one person or a whole team)</li><br /><li>Have had any exposure to VOIP systems or call centre switchboards</li><br /><li>Have experience of using live chat software (like Intercom), and CRM tools (like Zendesk)</li><br /><li>Have experience dealing with complaints and disputes</li><br /><li>Have experience in working with insurance claims</li><br /><li>Have experience of working in a regulated industry</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What will you get in return?</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>A competative salary package with excellent growth opportunities</li><br /><li>A&nbsp; chance to work in a lively supportive environment, where no two days are the same.</li><br /><li>A chance to be part of the UK fastest growing insurer, as one of our very earliest members of an <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.customerserviceexcellenceawards.co.uk%2F2019winners' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>award-winning</a> team.</li><br /><li>Opportunities to advance your career in any direction.

You will be a one-person team responsible for researching sales leads, reading my emails to see which emails I've sent and to whom, recording that information, and harassing me to make sure I send emails when I'm meant to. Internally we have been calling this role a &quot;Human CRM&quot;. My business is recruitment consultancy, and we are a 100% completely legitimate and above-board company -- you will be making the world a better place, rather than dealing with some shady internet marketing scam.\\n\\nMust-have skills:\\n\\n * Ability to understand written English well\\n * A terrifyingly complete attention to detail\\n * Be based (anywhere) in the EU\\n\\nThe role will take approximately 2 hours a day, and we'll pay $20 USD an hour for that. There will be days when there is literally no work to do, and days when you'll need to work 6 hours, but very little of the work is time-sensitive. This would be a good job for a stay-at-home parent who needs some extra cash, but we'll accept anyone who can get through the interview.\\n\\nThe interview process works like this. You'll need to follow the instructions below _to the letter_. They should take you less than 5 minutes. If that works, we'll send you a task that takes one hour to complete. If you do well on that, we'll give you some work to do that will take you approximately ten hours, and we'll pay you $200 to do that.\\n\\nHere's the first task. You need to email   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span> with the exact subject line &quot;I am a human CRM&quot;, without the quotes. Any variation on that, and we'll automatically reject your application. In the body of the email, please:\\n\\n* Confirm the country you live in. IT MUST BE IN THE EU.\\n* Research what would be some sensible times for a person in Bangkok, a person in London, and a person in Plovdiv to have a phone call, on October the 28th. Include a guess as to why I chose that date\\n* Summarize in exactly five sentences the plot of Romeo and Juliet\\n\\nNOTHING ELSE is required at that stage. Don't attach a CV, don't tell me about your experience. I just want the three bullet points above! A computer will read your email, and reject it if the title doesn't match.\\n\\n \\n\\n#Salary\\n$9,600\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- EU-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

The strongest candidates will possess the qualities and mindsets below:</p><ul><li><strong>You love details. </strong>You notice things that other people don’t. You approach each task you lead with an eagle eye toward details and anticipate every step and possible misstep in the process. It makes you incredibly happy when things fit together just right and projects and plans have been laid out down to the last detail. Secretly, there’s something you love about vetting a data set or proofreading a final document – you love catching and righting those small, but in your mind, critical points.</li><li><strong>You make things happen.</strong> You don’t get overwhelmed easily and you take personal responsibility for the success of your work whether it requires managing back-end processes, engaging with a team, or setting up others to execute effectively. You take pride in your integrity and follow-through on tasks. People would describe you as <em>dependable</em> and <em>driven</em>; they know when they ask you to do something, it’s as good as done.</li><li><strong>You’re a self-driven learner. </strong>You consistently seek feedback from diverse sources to learn and improve; you drive your professional development with purpose and focus on outcomes; and you have a knack for devising, implementing, and investing others in systems that improve individual and team performance. Reflecting on your work and strengthening your approach based on your reflections is second nature to you.</li><li><strong>You’re a great communicator.</strong> You value precision and clarity in language. Whatever the medium, when people receive a message from you they are crystal-clear on the purpose and any requested action. They feel respected and that their time was well-spent.</li><li><strong>You know policies like the back of your hand.</strong> You understand the importance of policies and procedures, and you take time to fully internalize them. You care about being a steward of our organization’s resources and you work to ensure that we stretch the Teach For America dollar as efficiently as possible, taking advantage of all discounts and corporate partnerships. You care about the way we spend our money and adhere to policies because you understand the stakes involved when we spend money that’s been fundraised by our colleagues.</li><li><strong>You’re a logistics master. </strong>You have superior logistics skills. You think ahead about what will be needed and strategize or make adjustments accordingly. Whether it be housing, dining, transportation or an unknown variable, you have lined up the necessary supports and resources well in advance and everyone involved in something you’re planning knows where to be, by when, and what the back-up plan is, just in case.</li><li><strong>You’re a jack of all trades. </strong>You’re flexible. You know a little bit about a lot of things and if you don’t know, you’re quick to learn. You’re willing to help out wherever needed and thrive in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment. You are a resourceful, results-oriented team player with a positive “can do” attitude and a sense of humor. You are skilled at managing complexity and adjust course easily and quickly when things fall off-track. You’re not thrown off by feedback (in fact, you thrive on it) and are able to incorporate and turn it around quickly.</li><li><strong>You’re a people person. </strong>You forge strong, trusting relationships with diverse groups of people. You’re empathetic and intuitive; you often know what people need or want before they do. You’re socially flexible and know how to attune and calibrate your interactional style depending on the environment, audience, or context. You are fueled by collaborating and working to make others efficient and effective. You know when a healthy dose of humor is called for. People really like you, and you really like them.</li></ul><p><strong>THE ORGANIZATION</strong><br>There are more than 16 million children growing up in poverty in the U.S., and less than 10 percent of them will graduate from college. These statistics are not a reflection of our children’s potential; we know that children growing up in poverty can and do achieve at the highest levels.

As we revolutionize the way people manage their expenses, being part of the Expensify team means building the easiest, fastest, and most efficient platform to automate everything expense-related. </p><p>We‘ve expanded into the UK market and set up shop in London. Help shape the team that will launch our global domination of expense reports and maintain a standard of excellence around the world.</p><p>Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most talked about perk is our <a href='https://we.are.expensify.com/explore-the-world' rel='nofollow'>Offshore</a> where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we’re going to Vietnam, do you want to join?</p><h3>About The Job</h3><p>As a Success Coach, you’ll focus on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems that we integrate with.  Our customers come in all shapes and sizes and we do our best to make them as happy as possible (read: phenomenal support is the name of the game). When our product changes, you’ll be the point of contact for our customers via email, in product announcements, phone calls and (occasional) in-person visits.</p><h3>About You</h3><p>Joining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and ever changing work environment. You’re fearless and relish in big challenges, working within the grey and making it concrete and clear. You’re entrepreneurial, you love supporting customers and helping them solve complex problems -- all with the ease of a trapeze artist! You’re a digital expert and love interacting with customers through email, chat, and sometimes over the phone.  Because Expensify is a simple product that connects to a variety of deceptively complex financial systems, you’re also someone who is comfortable wading in the complicated waters of accounting and simplifying it for our customers.</p><p>For the best possible fit, we’re looking for someone who can:</p><ul><li><p>Articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about the product implications of a new feature, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem. The ideal candidate will be able to clearly articulate themselves in each scenario.</p></li><li><p>Maintain customer happiness and problem solve on their behalf by providing clear and friendly written and verbal communication.</p></li><li><p>Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things move quickly in this environment and it’s crucial that you are able to react to new information and re-prioritize accordingly.</p></li><li><p>Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we're all learning things as we go. We also love anyone who's able to effectively train colleagues as we grow the team.</p></li><li><p>Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company day to day, even if it may be repetitive sometimes and not so glamorous. #oneteamonedream</p></li><li><p>Support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. Make no mistake, this role is grounded in customer support, no matter the customer size.</p></li><li><p>Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly, but it is only possible with in-depth product knowledge and a deep understanding of the problem that the customer is trying to solve.</p></li><li><p>Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, not required!</p></li></ul><h3>What We Offer</h3><ul><li><p>Full-time, salaried position</p></li><li><p>Employer match to retirement pension</p></li><li><p>100% of the premiums for Dental and Medical insurance</p></li><li><p>Free lunch</p></li><li><p>Flexible vacation policy</p></li><li><p>Last, but far from least, the company spends 3 weeks abroad as a team</p></li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are many ways to do that, but the easiest way to help us out is by answering the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren't successful addressing their concerns, why not?</p></li><li><p>Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?</p></li><li><p>If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?</p></li><li><p>What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?</p></li><li><p>How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</p></li></ol><h3>Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways!
