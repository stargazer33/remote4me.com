You&rsquo;re likely working in a support role for some form of online platform, either currently remotely or with a desire to work remotely and flexibly.</p><br /><p>You will have guided customers through an entire customer service and support journey. That means you will have had the conversations needed to support someone through everything from being interested in a platform, to joining it, and to troubleshooting any difficulties they have, helping them make the most of a service.</p><br /><p>You will also be a seasoned champion of listening to customer feedback and turning anyone who may have had a negative experience into happy and loyal returning customers.</p><br /><p><em>Fancy a change?</em></p><br /><p>Does helping customers of a loyal, passionate online community sound like a good day at the 'office' to you? Do you want to work remotely and flexibly forever (not just because you have to now)? Do you want to join one of the internet&rsquo;s largest, most passionate communities around classic cars, and be a part of the team delivering something new into an established customer service lead team?</p><br /><p>Car &amp; Classic is visited, used, read, and loved by millions of loyal users. It&rsquo;s established as one of the world&rsquo;s largest communities for the sale and enjoyment of classic cars. All this is delivered by a small, focused and dedicated team.</p><br /><p>We want to do more for our community.

    "content": "<h3> Remote Sales and Customer Champion </h3><div><div>Greenback Expat Tax Services is a company that specializes in preparing tax returns for Americans living overseas. We are a highly energetic, positive, resourceful team working virtually across the globe. We believe that executional excellence is key to success. We are currently seeking a talented, passionate, enthusiastic <strong>Sales and Customer Champion </strong>to join our team<strong>. </strong>As a business, our DNA and core is about excellence in customer experience plus we‚Äôre in a big period of growth for the business, so we see this role as one of the most integral ones on our team.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The role has two critical and interrelated, but distinct responsibilities. You need to be passionate, experienced and talented at both.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Customer Care:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</div><div>We call this role a ‚Äúcustomer champion‚Äù for a reason- your role is to be the customer advocate and champion for our business. Good customer service seeks to understand a customer‚Äôs situation and help them resolve that situation at the first point of contact. Great customer service seeks to resolve that customer‚Äôs need, and translate that need back to the business to ensure that we improve- sometimes in tiny ways- and avoid any customer having a similar confusion moving forward.<em> Incredible customer service</em> does not just that, but seeks to listen to what‚Äôs not being said, read between the lines and take that back to make the experience better- for that customer and every one after that one. We believe our customers deserve incredible customer care. So, if you do too, and you love to help people, can‚Äôt stand the idea of anyone ever being confused or have anything other than a surprisingly delightful experience working with us, we‚Äôd love for you to apply.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Sales:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In the same way that we care deeply about customer experience, we also understand that in order to win that business, we need to earn the trust of prospective customers. That‚Äôs not easy (nor should it be!). We know that when someone starts the process of engaging a tax preparer, they may feel anxious, they may feel frustrated, and they may dread the process. Taxes aren‚Äôt at the top of their list, and they need us to make it easy for them, but also make them feel confident that we are in control of their tax needs. The right sales person doesn‚Äôt just answer a question, but help to really explain and articulate what makes Greenback special and why we‚Äôre a great fit compared to other alternatives. The right sales person can speak intelligently about taxes, about how we work, about the strength of our accountant team and do so in a genuine, not pushy way. Timeliness, appropriate feedback, good knowledge of the industry as well as our internal process are all critical to the role.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Last- but certainly not least- we‚Äôre looking for someone who‚Äôs a great fit for our company culture. We‚Äôre a small, tight knit team- all of us working remotely from home offices. We‚Äôre growing fast (check us out on the INC 5000 list- whoohoo!). We‚Äôre obsessive about customer experience, believe that planning is the key to success, and like to work hard and make things happen- but also live our lives outside of the (home) office too! We‚Äôre looking for someone who is confident, reliable, an excellent communicator, loves working in a fast-paced team, and is able to get things done with minimal supervision (we don‚Äôt like looking over your shoulder- and don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd like that either).&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Key skills needed:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Excellent communication skills (does that go without saying?). You will mostly be speaking with people via email (80%), with some phone calls (20%). You need to be able to read between the lines and craft messaging that is warm, friendly, professional and really meets the need of the specific demands of that email interaction.&nbsp;</li><li>The ability to convert warm leads at a high volume by setting proper expectations, providing thoughtful responses, and clearly outlining next steps.&nbsp;</li><li>Ability to identify opportunities to add value by monitoring industry changes, trends and customer needs.&nbsp;</li><li>Use analytics to manage and measure your success, know where to put additional effort, and prioritize. That means you need to be someone who can manage to targets, metrics, and can analyze these metrics, understand what they mean, and make good decisions as a result.&nbsp;</li><li>Excellence in execution: Attention to detail and ability to keep organized/juggle multiple things at once. We're a seasonal business, so there are times when our inboxes are on fire! This is part of the role, and being organized, handling stress well and being able to juggle high demand situations comes with the territory.&nbsp;</li><li>We don‚Äôt expect you to be an accountant, but you will need to learn and become a subject matter expert on US expat taxes.&nbsp;</li><li>Bonus: current or former expat, or someone who appreciates or gets excited about the expat life.&nbsp;</li><li>Time zone: we‚Äôre looking for someone who is in a fixed time zone +/- 2 hours from GMT. We‚Äôre not looking for long term travelers/people who aren‚Äôt in the same time zone most of the year.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div>What we offer:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>The opportunity for you to work with highly talented, communicative, make-it-happen people who also love adventure.</li><li>&nbsp;Very generous time off policy.&nbsp;</li><li>4 weeks of Paid Parental Leave at 100% of your salary!&nbsp;</li><li>We have an excellent benefits package that includes a 401k plan (with company match), medical, vision, and dental coverage (We pay 75% of your premium) and short-term disability (We cover 100% of the cost)!&nbsp;</li><li>Annual team trip (this year: San Diego, last year: Playa del Carmen, Mexico)&nbsp;</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Apply today!!! To apply, please visit:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We ONLY accept applications via our website here: https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/jobs/remote-sales-and-customer-champion/&nbsp;</div></div>",

Generally via email, though sometimes we take the initiative to call and knock it out over the phone (in our business, customers are often really stoked to hear from a real person!).</div><div><br>The second third is making ourselves available for demos, help sessions, consultations (affectionately referred to as hand holding sessions, these are where we get to shine by letting our customers get to talk to and be guided by A REAL PERSON).</div><div><br>The third third is where we have time and bandwidth to do things above and beyond just reacting to incoming needs and requests. This is when we do outreach to our customers (affectionately dubbed ‚Äúdoling out customer love‚Äù), improve and expand our learning resources (like writing articles and making help videos), and take on other sorts of projects to further our mission to serve coaches.</div><div><br>Each of these thirds affords opportunities to shine and excel, and gives a lot of variety from day to day plus opportunities to learn. The third third in particular is ripe for you to bring your creativity and have your voice heard to make lasting contributions.</div><div><br><strong><br>Structure of the position<br></strong><br></div><div>The position is full-time, 40-45 hours per week during business hours in North America. On average about 2 of these hours per week will be over the weekend to cover incoming support issues. The position is remote, though may occasionally require commuting for in-person demos and meet ups, and several times a year entails travel for conferences and in-person work with the team (er, when things settle down with this whole COVID-19 thing, ahem!). You must be a US resident.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Compensation and Benefits</strong><br><br></div><div>Because our team is so small, it is vitally important for us to find the right fit in adding number three. Therefore the first two months is a test period during which you‚Äôll be an hourly contractor earning $30/hour. You can start full time to begin or we can be flexible to allow you to ramp up as needed to assist with your transition.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>After two months if we agree this is a Good Thing‚Ñ¢, congratulations! That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre going for and you will then be offered a full-time salaried position starting at $60,000 per year. As a salaried employee vacation benefits apply: holidays plus THREE weeks off per year. Your discretionary paid time off is earned pro rata as you go starting from your official employment hire date.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>After two months as a salaried employee, the following additional benefits kick in:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>$100 monthly fitness allowance ($1200 per year)</li><li>$500 per year continuing education allowance (to learn ANYTHING you want, doesn‚Äôt need to be job related; we know that curious and happy employees are the best kind)</li><li>$50 monthly internet/phone allowance ($600 per year)</li><li>QSEHRA health insurance premium reimbursement benefit of up to $5,150 per year for self-only employees ($429.17 per month) and $10,450 per year for employees with a family ($870.83 per month)</li><li>SIMPLE IRA 100% match of up to 3% of salary (3% of $60,000 is $1800)</li></ul><div><br>Cash value of these benefits maxed out: $1200 + $500 + $600 + $5150 + $1800 = <strong>$9250<br></strong><br></div><div>Total compensation adds up to <strong>$69,250 + 3 weeks paid vacation</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Requirements and Applying<br></strong><br>Again, you need to have some sort of coaching experience to be considered. <strong>Please do not apply if you don‚Äôt have that.</strong></div><div><br>Have that sort of background? Great! The next step is to <a href='https://www.coachaccountable.com/page/supportJob#video' rel='nofollow'>watch this video</a>.</div></div>",

We're focused on developing relationships with employers from a wide variety of industries to enhance job recruitment opportunities for students at all nine academic divisions of the university. Our purpose is to lead and streamline the interactions major employers have with the university to ensure that neither side misses an opportunity to connect a talented and qualified student with a potential job. We support Hopkins grads and post-doctorate fellows towards getting multiple offers for jobs they're excited about.\\n\\nTo provide some context about this office, Johns Hopkins University has developed an ambitious vision to continue to integrate life design, experiential learning, and mentoring in the academic and co-curricular learning experience for all students and postdoctoral fellows. Under the leadership of Dr. Farouk Dey, the inaugural vice provost for integrative learning and life design, the university has announced the creation of three new departments and several new initiatives and mission that will ensure that every student and postdoctoral fellow will have the ability to pursue life purpose regardless of background, field of study, or social capital. Read more about this plan here.\\n\\nThis new vision is focused on scalability of resources and services. For this transformation to work, traditional one-on-one counseling and coaching services are taking a backseat to a culture of scalable programs and interventions. Those who thrive as counselors, advisors, and coaches and do not enjoy the intense focus on scalability and metrics may not be the best fit for this organization.\\n\\nAbout the role:\\n\\nReporting to the Executive Director of Hire Hopkins, the Associate Director of Hire Hopkins will assist in building relationships with companies for the benefit of all students, postdoctoral fellows, and alumni at Johns Hopkins University. The Associate Director will work to attract top employers who can work with multiple schools across the university and grow employer representation at all divisions and departments. They will work closely with the Executive Director to collaborate with leadership across the university, career centers, Johns Hopkins Tech Ventures (JHTV), DAR, and Corporate Relations to implement institution-wide programs that help university staff to best engage employers and ultimately, recruit talent for internships and employment. At its core, this is a highly collaborative and strategic position that will require coordinating business development, meetings, phone calls, training and follow-up actions among employers, career centers, and schools.\\n\\nBecause Hire Hopkins is a ‚Äústart-up‚Äù office, the Associate Director will also need to be able to help the Executive Director successfully launch Hire Hopkins within a decentralized university by offering operational support, which can vary from marketing &amp; communications, to learning &amp; development.\\n\\nThis is a great opportunity for someone with a proven track-record in employer development, recruiting, business development, and/or sales who would also enjoy supporting operationally and doing whatever is needed to make things work. This is a ‚Äústart-up‚Äù type operation with the perks of a larger organization's resources.\\n\\nSpecific Duties &amp; Responsibilities:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Develop strategies for targeting decision-makers at companies in order to book meeting pitches.\\n‚Ä¢ Lead outbound outreach (cold calls, sending emails, and leading high-level discovery calls) with companies who can work with and hire Johns Hopkins graduates and post-doctorate fellows.\\n‚Ä¢ Drive hiring partner pipeline through setting up qualified meetings with top employers.\\n‚Ä¢ Identify potential hiring partners and act as a front door for those partners into Hopkins.\\n‚Ä¢ Initiate and coordinate partner engagement including site visits or alternative options to explore opportunities for future or expanded collaboration.\\n‚Ä¢ Take a leadership role in coordinating all aspects of deal negotiation and oversee hiring partnerships from identification through closure stage. Attention to detail and proper follow up is critical.\\n‚Ä¢ Conduct market research and forecast hiring trends of top employers.\\n‚Ä¢ Collaborate with colleagues across divisions and units, especially Johns Hopkins Tech Ventures (JHTV), Corporate Relations, Development &amp; Alumni relations, and the career centers to ensure a unified approach. Maintain and continue to build relationships within the university to create a culture of trust and collaboration.\\n‚Ä¢ Be a subject matter expert on Johns Hopkins University's various schools, departments, and students, what they bring to the table, and how they compare to other talent pools.\\n‚Ä¢ Report weekly to the Executive Director on market intelligence gained, business development activity and success.\\n‚Ä¢ Use Salesforce and other relevant tech tools to track actions, metrics, and results.\\n‚Ä¢ Manage ongoing relationships with partners at a high level, and work with employer engagement staff members to communicate reporting milestones and other progress.\\n‚Ä¢ Support engagement in social media, digital outlets, and academic and professional journals and associations to establish Hire Hopkins as an exciting brand, tell the story, and serve as a thought leader at Johns Hopkins University, industry, and in higher education.\\n‚Ä¢ Willingness and ability to travel up to 25-30%.\\n\\nThe Ideal Candidate:\\n\\nThe ideal candidate is entrepreneurial, data and outcomes driven, strong in planning and execution, comfortable leading programs and interventions with groups, and enjoys developing relationships and connections with multiple stakeholders at once. They must be transparent, open-minded, creative and committed to working and unifying members in a heavily decentralized institution. Also, the ability to resolve complex problems while maintaining a sense of humor and a solution-oriented, positive attitude is critical.\\n\\nWe have modernized our approach and expect that our teams can work from anywhere for the purpose of scaling our impact across the institution. For this model to work, the ideal candidate must present excellent skills in relationship development, being self-driven, and engaging audiences in groups digitally. The ideal candidate has experience working remotely and is comfortable with co-working and flexible work arrangements. We expect the ideal candidate to be available during the Eastern time zone and comfortable working from a home office or co-working space. We will provide a laptop, cellphone, and co-working stipend if need be.\\n\\nA big plus if they are an effective user of tech tools, social media, and other digital outlets to engage multiple audiences, strengthen individual and organizational brand, scale impact, and influence public opinion.\\n\\nMinimum Qualifications:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Bachelor's degree required.\\n‚Ä¢ Three (3) years recent direct experience in business development, sales, HR consulting, or recruiting with large-scale organizations.\\n‚Ä¢ Proven track-record of having successfully executed business development and negotiated partnerships.\\n\\nPreferred Qualifications:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ 2+ years operational experience in start-up, small business, or decentralized higher ed environments.\\n‚Ä¢ Professional experience in marketing, communications, branding, and/or social media.\\n‚Ä¢ Experience in college recruiting.\\n\\nSpecial Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Must have a mastery of best practice in prospecting, sales, recruiting and business development.\\n‚Ä¢ Excellent oral, written and interpersonal skills.
