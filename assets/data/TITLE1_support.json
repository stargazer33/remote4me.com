    "content": "<p><strong>SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE </strong></p><br /><p>OLIO is the world&rsquo;s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and our mission is to solve the problem of food waste in the home &amp; local community. We do this by connecting anyone with spare food &ndash; which can be households or local businesses &ndash; with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away &pound;800 of food each year - collectively adding up to &pound;15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile &amp; web apps.</p><br /><p>Over the past 4 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. We now have 1.3 million users who have together shared well over 2.3 million portions of food&ndash; with food being successfully shared in 49 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our Food Waste Heroes programme, with over 5,000 registered Food Waste Hero users who rescue food from local businesses, take it home and shared it with their neighbours via the OLIO app. OLIO is now looking for an intern to join the core team as we embark upon the next exciting phase in our journey.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITY &ndash; LONDON and REMOTE</strong></p><br /><p>To support the OLIO team and OLIO Food Waste Heroes, we are recruiting for a Food Waste Hero Support intern. You will report into Anna Lopez-Fujimaki, Food Waste Hero Supply &amp; Support Associate.</p><br /><p>The Food Waste Heroes (FWHs) programme involves OLIO matching small groups of waste-busting volunteers with their local street food market, farmers&rsquo; market, shop, café, bakery, deli, greengrocer, hotel or restaurant. Once matched, the FWHs provide a service by collecting any unsold surplus food at the end of the day. Food Waste Heroes then use the OLIO app to re-distribute the saved food within their local community.</p><br /><p>In this role you will be responsible for:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Supporting the OLIO Food Waste Hero Community on a broad range of topics (sharing on OLIO, food safety, Food Waste Hero registration and training, reaching out to local businesses) via a broad variety of channels (social media, email, customer service software, WhatsApp, telephone)</li><br /><li>Supporting the OLIO Food Waste Hero team with admin tasks as needed, such as registering participating food businesses on the OLIO systems and ensuring compliance with OLIO&rsquo;s policies</li><br /><li>Responding to volunteers&rsquo; emails using HelpScout (customer service software)</li><br /><li>Stepping in to rescue and redistribute food to the local community (London only, if London-based) as and when needed to stop good food from going to waste and to maintain food business donor relations</li><br /></ul><br /><p>All of our roles are remote working roles, however for London based team members there is the ability to co-work as well. We live for our mission, but like to have fun along the way!</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>IS THIS YOU? </strong></p><br /><p>Our ideal internship candidate will first and foremost be as passionate about our mission as we are! In addition to this, you will have the following experience and skills:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Projects, university or voluntary work in the field of social good or environmentalism</li><br /><li>A high level of organisational skills and attention to detail</li><br /><li>Articulate and extroverted, with the ability to explain things in simple terms</li><br /><li>Confident working with people from all walks of life </li><br /></ul><br /><p>And all OLIO team members share these attributes:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>A self-starter with a &lsquo;can-do&rsquo; attitude o Resourceful and creative</li><br /><li>Thorough, but able to move quickly and decisively</li><br /><li>A ruthless ability to prioritise</li><br /><li>Excellent communication skills</li><br /><li>Fun to work with ☺</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><em>PLEASE NOTE: This is an unpaid internship for fully enrolled university students who want to put theory into practice and see the inside of a fast-growing start-up.

So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

We&rsquo;ve built the UK&rsquo;s first real-time pay-by-mile car insurance policies with a smart driving app, bringing the same level of on-demand convenience to car ownership that people now expect from taxis and take-away food.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We launched in the UK in July 2018 and our highly-engaged member base is growing quickly, so we&rsquo;re expanding our&nbsp;<a href='https://www.customerserviceexcellenceawards.co.uk/2019winners' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>award-winning</a>&nbsp;team to support our policyholders with excellent customer service.

We'd be looking for someone that would be able to work into the evening (sometimes up until 9/10pm), and was also available to work at the weekend. Remote working is something we could definitely consider after you've passed your first 2 months with us.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be a skilled, versatile writer and a natural communicator with a friendly and professional phone manner and a keen eye for detail. You&rsquo;ll be as comfortable using emojis as you are with semi colons, and while you&rsquo;re disciplined enough to stick to a script when needed &ndash; you should have the wit and charm to rewrite it too (when appropriate). It would help if English is your first language, but this is certainly not essential.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be proactive, upbeat and able to work both with a team and independently to solve problems and come up with new ways to keep our customer base happy. It would be ideal if you have proven experience in a customer service or support role and you get a kick out of helping improve processes to make our customer experience the best it can be.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Your day-to-day will involve answering and resolving customer queries through our in-app messenger, on the phone, on social media or via email.

You will be a one-person team responsible for researching sales leads, reading my emails to see which emails I've sent and to whom, recording that information, and harassing me to make sure I send emails when I'm meant to. Internally we have been calling this role a &quot;Human CRM&quot;. My business is recruitment consultancy, and we are a 100% completely legitimate and above-board company -- you will be making the world a better place, rather than dealing with some shady internet marketing scam.\\n\\nMust-have skills:\\n\\n * Ability to understand written English well\\n * A terrifyingly complete attention to detail\\n * Be based (anywhere) in the EU\\n\\nThe role will take approximately 2 hours a day, and we'll pay $20 USD an hour for that. There will be days when there is literally no work to do, and days when you'll need to work 6 hours, but very little of the work is time-sensitive. This would be a good job for a stay-at-home parent who needs some extra cash, but we'll accept anyone who can get through the interview.\\n\\nThe interview process works like this. You'll need to follow the instructions below _to the letter_. They should take you less than 5 minutes. If that works, we'll send you a task that takes one hour to complete. If you do well on that, we'll give you some work to do that will take you approximately ten hours, and we'll pay you $200 to do that.\\n\\nHere's the first task. You need to email   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span> with the exact subject line &quot;I am a human CRM&quot;, without the quotes. Any variation on that, and we'll automatically reject your application. In the body of the email, please:\\n\\n* Confirm the country you live in. IT MUST BE IN THE EU.\\n* Research what would be some sensible times for a person in Bangkok, a person in London, and a person in Plovdiv to have a phone call, on October the 28th. Include a guess as to why I chose that date\\n* Summarize in exactly five sentences the plot of Romeo and Juliet\\n\\nNOTHING ELSE is required at that stage. Don't attach a CV, don't tell me about your experience. I just want the three bullet points above! A computer will read your email, and reject it if the title doesn't match.\\n\\n \\n\\n#Salary\\n$9,600\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- EU-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

    "content": "<h3><b> Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept:</b></h3> &nbsp; <p>Join our passionate team of top-notch experts to solve a real-world problem, and help people spend less time managing expenses and more time pursuing their real goals. As we revolutionize the way people manage their expenses, being part of the Expensify team means building the easiest, fastest, and most efficient platform to automate everything expense-related. </p><p>We‘ve expanded into the UK market and set up shop in London. Help shape the team that will launch our global domination of expense reports and maintain a standard of excellence around the world.</p><p>Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most talked about perk is our <a href='https://we.are.expensify.com/explore-the-world' rel='nofollow'>Offshore</a> where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we’re going to Vietnam, do you want to join?</p><h3>About The Job</h3><p>As a Success Coach, you’ll focus on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems that we integrate with.  Our customers come in all shapes and sizes and we do our best to make them as happy as possible (read: phenomenal support is the name of the game). When our product changes, you’ll be the point of contact for our customers via email, in product announcements, phone calls and (occasional) in-person visits.</p><h3>About You</h3><p>Joining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and ever changing work environment. You’re fearless and relish in big challenges, working within the grey and making it concrete and clear. You’re entrepreneurial, you love supporting customers and helping them solve complex problems -- all with the ease of a trapeze artist! You’re a digital expert and love interacting with customers through email, chat, and sometimes over the phone.  Because Expensify is a simple product that connects to a variety of deceptively complex financial systems, you’re also someone who is comfortable wading in the complicated waters of accounting and simplifying it for our customers.</p><p>For the best possible fit, we’re looking for someone who can:</p><ul><li><p>Articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about the product implications of a new feature, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem. The ideal candidate will be able to clearly articulate themselves in each scenario.</p></li><li><p>Maintain customer happiness and problem solve on their behalf by providing clear and friendly written and verbal communication.</p></li><li><p>Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things move quickly in this environment and it’s crucial that you are able to react to new information and re-prioritize accordingly.</p></li><li><p>Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we're all learning things as we go. We also love anyone who's able to effectively train colleagues as we grow the team.</p></li><li><p>Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company day to day, even if it may be repetitive sometimes and not so glamorous. #oneteamonedream</p></li><li><p>Support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. Make no mistake, this role is grounded in customer support, no matter the customer size.</p></li><li><p>Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly, but it is only possible with in-depth product knowledge and a deep understanding of the problem that the customer is trying to solve.</p></li><li><p>Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, not required!</p></li></ul><h3>What We Offer</h3><ul><li><p>Full-time, salaried position</p></li><li><p>Employer match to retirement pension</p></li><li><p>100% of the premiums for Dental and Medical insurance</p></li><li><p>Free lunch</p></li><li><p>Flexible vacation policy</p></li><li><p>Last, but far from least, the company spends 3 weeks abroad as a team</p></li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are many ways to do that, but the easiest way to help us out is by answering the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren't successful addressing their concerns, why not?</p></li><li><p>Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?</p></li><li><p>If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?</p></li><li><p>What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?</p></li><li><p>How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</p></li></ol><h3>Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href='mailto:jobs@expensify.com' rel='nofollow'>jobs@expensify.com</a>. We're excited to hear from you!</h3> ",

Our product is a performance feedback platform rolled out company-wide from the intern to the CEO. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives, organize one-on-one meetings, and to praise each other for a job well done</div><div>We’ve got a very <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/customer-team' rel='nofollow'>strong customer team</a> in place that we’re now looking to grow with a friendly and proactive customer success manager who is keen to work full-time remotel<br><br><br></div><h3>What you’ll do</h3><div>Our ultimate CS goal is that customers are happy and renew without hesitation. Our process is built on creating personal relationships with clients, educating them, and relaying their feedback and needs into the product roadmap. You’ll focus on the US eastern time zones, helping out with EU and PST clients clients too.<br><br></div><div>As a successul CS manager, you will</div><ul><li>Help customers during the onboarding process, ensuring they know the product and what kinds of processes can work best for their business</li><li>Lend a hand when customers need support. Advanced tickets will be handled by our support team, but clients really appreciate it when they have a single contact for most questions.</li><li>Reach out to your customers on a regular cadence, and set up 30-minute calls to learn about their challenges, to suggest improvements to their processes, and to share product news with them</li><li>Collect all the knowledge and track it in our CRM, and share the highlights (or lowlights) inside the CS team but also with product management or even company-wide</li><li>Reach out to clients in time, and ensure their renewal is something they look forward to!</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Once you got the hang of it, there’s a lot more you can get involved with:</div><ul><li>Make suggestions on how to improve our internal processes, and the product itself</li><li>Join feature development projects and represent the customer perspective</li><li>Rally customers for early-access testing, and relay back the feedback you receive</li><li>Find novel ways to help customers get more value. Collaborate with marketing, or development, or product, or sales, or support, and get things done</li></ul><div><br>You’re expected to think outside the box – anything that helps making clients more successful is fair game. We don’t lock clients into long term contracts, and we never overpromise during the sales process, so it’s very rewarding work. At the same time we definitely need to be on our toes and truly help clients, as they can literally leave any time and get their money back.</div><div><br></div><h3>Who we’re looking for</h3><div><strong>5 years of experience in comparable roles helping customers with B2B software:</strong> Our product is a web-based SAAS solution, so experience in customer success or account management with comparable online products is a must. Ideally you’ve worked on two or more products before.<br><br></div><div><strong>You are business-savvy:</strong> You see customer renewal as a top priority, and your goal is to keep churn low. You’re comfortable to prioritize, so that as many customers as possible are as likely to renew as possible.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Experience with remote work:</strong> There are many advantages to working from home: No commute, flexible location, and more. It’s not as if you’ll be entirely on your own — we communicate constantly using Hangouts, Slack, and Confluence. (Plus we’ll fly you over to Berlin once a year.) Our satellite workers are of the self-driven, comfortably autonomous variety though. So if you are naturally a self-starter and very proactive about keeping everyone in the loop, you’ll fit right in!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Process passion:</strong> You get excited at improving processes. You’ve seen lots of approaches already, and can really contribute to our processes and make them better. You’re highly structured and will prepare diligently and take copious amounts of notes about customers and their needs afterward.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Technical plus charming:</strong> You need to be tech-savvy and a fast learner, as our product is complex and supports a wide range of HR practices. At the same time, you just <em>have</em> to love people and interacting with them. You need to be an overall positive person, and your glass should always be half-full.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Willingness to go the extra mile:</strong> It’s not about making calls as quickly as possible. It’s about really helping clients, and that might involve researching or mulling over something for a few days, and then getting back to the customer once you have an even better idea/suggestion/workaround later on</div><div><br>Prior experience in HR- related topics is a major plus, and general interest in the topic is a must.<br><br><br></div><h3>More reasons to work at SI</h3><ul><li>We’re international: We’re based in Berlin and sell mainly to the US, Australia and the UK. Our staff of 35 hails from 16 countries (all our written communication is in English)</li><li>We're self-funded — our only &quot;investors&quot; are our amazing <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/customers/' rel='nofollow'>customers</a> who have helped us grow our customer base largely through word of mouth.</li><li>We invest in our people. You’ll get a learning &amp; development budge and days off for attending conferences</li><li>We’re serious about our open and tolerant company culture, and we believe diversity makes our culture and our product better.</li><li>We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales. Also, there are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!</li><li>You’re invited to visit our Berlin head office for three weeks once a year and we cover the costs. Take an <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/office-tour/' rel='nofollow'>office tour</a>.</li><li>We want to do well by doing good, so we turn down dodgy clients and <a href='https://startup.small-improvements.com/lets-good-donations-2017/' rel='nofollow'>donate 2% of our profits</a> to charity.</li><li>And we love to travel! <a href='https://vimeo.com/293382390' rel='nofollow'>Take a look at our last company trip</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>",

We’re looking for an empathetic, efficient problem solver who loves to make people’s day. This role will be a remote-based role keeping Pacific Time hours (9am-5pm Pacific Time).</p><p>Empathetic, passionate support-people love working at Mystery.org, because our elementary teacher and homeschool customers are raving fans of our product, and because ours is a company where customer issues get solved at the root, and quickly, so support is less about apologizing, and more about saying,&nbsp;<em>yes we can</em>! Our customer experience specialists work remotely and all (five currently) have been with us for at least a year, forming an engaged, positive team. We don’t just handle typical support requests; we also help with inside sales efforts, and our more experienced team members have become a go-to resource for a wide range of company projects. This is a great opportunity for empathetic, energetic people who want to grow with us as we scale to help us reach millions of children, at school and at home.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><ul><li>Do you have two or more years of experience delighting customers by solving their problems, and caring for them in a friendly, fun and professional way?</li><li>Are you a strong, empathetic, friendly communicator–both verbally (via phone or Zoom), and in writing?</li><li>Do you have experience with managing a high volume of different types of tasks using systems (such as ZenDesk, CRMs, or email/Slack), and creating approaches that allow you to move fast, while maintaining meticulous attention to each important detail?</li><li>Do you thrive on variety and regularly learning new things, in a school-year driven setting where ticket types change along with the seasonal needs of the teachers and administrators we support?</li><li>Are you happy to work from your home office, keeping Pacific Time hours (9 am – 5 pm)?</li><li>Are you uniquely motivated by our mission?</li></ul><p><strong>Day-to-day</strong></p><p>In this role you’ll report to our Director of Communication, Heike Larson. As a Customer Experience Specialist, your primary focus will be solving our customer’s problems. Mostly, we respond to customer inquiries via email–helping customers with a wide range of questions, from what lesson to teach next, to how to trouble-shoot video issues, from which of our membership levels to choose, to how to submit a purchase order. However, you’ll also answer inbound phone calls, and support our district partnership team with outbound calls to school or district admins to follow up on quotes they created, or emails that bounce.</p><p>In your daily work, you’ll be using a wide range of systems: ZenDesk, Slack, Asana, Zoom, in addition to the Google suite and our in-house CRM and content management system.</p><p>As you join, we’ll train you on all aspects of this job: we’ve got a robust wiki with training resources and best practices, in addition to a seasoned team eager to help you get up-to-speed. Once you’re on top of all ticket types and know Mystery well, you may also have the opportunity to work on projects for other teams in the company.</p><p>This is an opportunity to help more kids stay curious and become the next generation of problem solvers. While your work will be remote from your home office, we meet daily via Zoom as a team, and have weekly company-wide town halls. Plus, we all get together near our San Francisco office for our semi-annual offsites.</p><p><strong>Package &amp; Perks</strong></p><p><strong>If you’re looking for the basics:</strong></p><ul><li>$4M in funding from leading education investors (and we’re already profitable)</li><li>Competitive salary</li><li>Equity in a high-growth company</li><li>401K, health care, vacation</li><li>Customers who love us</li></ul><p>…but the real perks of working at Mystery.org are the quality of the people on your team and the problem we’re solving.

We&rsquo;re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our mission. We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.</p><br /><p>Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 30 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Shanghai, Singapore, Romania and North America. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.</p><br /><p>Winnow&rsquo;s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow has now worked with hundreds of sites to reduce food waste, including hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and high street restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for operations.</p><br /><p>As the global leader in addressing food waste, we are committed to continue pushing the envelope on what technology can do to solve this problem. Winnow Vision, our new artificial intelligence-based technology, is trained to automatically track all food waste thrown away. It has won awards at the World Economic Forum and has been received tremendous enthusiasm from our clients and the industry.

With our customers, we challenge them if we don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re achieving their goals, whether they be environmental or financial.</p><br /><p><strong>People of action.</strong>&nbsp;Done is better than perfect, and we learn by boldly doing then rapidly improving. We&rsquo;re breaking new ground, so we know things might go wrong. But we judge ourselves and each other on our reaction and our resilience.</p><br /><p><strong>Bound by food.</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re a diverse bunch, but our belief in the value of food is the common thread in everything we do. With each other, we celebrate through our love and respect for food. With our customers, it means we work hard to develop creative tools to make it easy for chefs to value food.</p><br /><p><strong>Hungry and humble.</strong>&nbsp;Our product is revolutionary, our people are impressive, and we&rsquo;re hungry for change. But, we&rsquo;re just the catalyst for a bigger movement. We stay humble regardless of our success, and make chefs the heroes in this journey.</p><br /><p>This is an opportunity to join a rapidly growing start-up (and one of Wired&rsquo;s top 100 start-ups in Europe) and help us propel our growth at what is truly the most exciting and dynamic points in time in our business.

We’re looking for an empathetic, efficient problem solver who loves to make people’s day. This role will be a remote-based role keeping Pacific Time hours (9am-5pm Pacific Time).</div><div><br>Empathetic, passionate support-people love working at Mystery.org, because our elementary teacher and homeschool customers are raving fans of our product, and because ours is a company where customer issues get solved at the root, and quickly, so support is less about apologizing, and more about saying, <em>yes we can</em>! Our customer experience specialists work remotely and all (five currently) have been with us for at least a year, forming an engaged, positive team. We don’t just handle typical support requests; we also help with inside sales efforts, and our more experienced team members have become a go-to resource for a wide range of company projects. This is a great opportunity for empathetic, energetic people who want to grow with us as we scale to help us reach millions of children, at school and at home.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>About You</strong></div><ul><li>Do you have two or more years of experience delighting customers by solving their problems, and caring for them in a friendly, fun and professional way?<br><br><br><br></li><li>Are you a strong, empathetic, friendly communicator--both verbally (via phone or Zoom), and in writing?&nbsp;<br><br><br><br></li><li>Do you have experience with managing a high volume of different types of tasks using systems (such as ZenDesk, CRMs, or email/Slack), and creating approaches that allow you to move fast, while maintaining meticulous attention to each important detail?<br><br><br></li><li>Do you thrive on variety and regularly learning new things, in a school-year driven setting where ticket types change along with the seasonal needs of the teachers and administrators we support?<br><br><br></li><li>Are you happy to work from your home office, keeping Pacific Time hours (9 am - 5 pm)? &nbsp;<br><br><br></li><li>Are you uniquely motivated by our mission?&nbsp;</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Day-to-day</strong></div><div><br>In this role you’ll report to our Director of Communication, Heike Larson. As a Customer Experience Specialist, your primary focus will be solving our customer’s problems. Mostly, we respond to customer inquiries via email--helping customers with a wide range of questions, from what lesson to teach next, to how to trouble-shoot video issues, from which of our membership levels to choose, to how to submit a purchase order. However, you’ll also answer inbound phone calls, and support our district partnership team with outbound calls to school or district admins to follow up on quotes they created, or emails that bounce.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>In your daily work, you’ll be using a wide range of systems: ZenDesk, Slack, Asana, Zoom, in addition to the Google suite and our in-house CRM and content management system.&nbsp;</div><div><br>As you join, we’ll train you on all aspects of this job: we’ve got a robust wiki with training resources and best practices, in addition to a seasoned team eager to help you get up-to-speed. Once you’re on top of all ticket types and know Mystery well, you may also have the opportunity to work on projects for other teams in the company.<br><br><br></div><div>This is an opportunity to help more kids stay curious and become the next generation of problem solvers. While your work will be remote from your home office, we meet daily via Zoom as a team, and have weekly company-wide town halls.
