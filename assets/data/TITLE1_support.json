Our customer experience specialists work remotely and all (five currently) have been with us for at least a year, forming an engaged, positive team. We don’t just handle typical support requests; we also help with inside sales efforts, and our more experienced team members have become a go-to resource for a wide range of company projects.

However, you’ll also answer inbound phone calls, and support our district partnership team with outbound calls to school or district admins to follow up on quotes they created, or emails that bounce.</p><p>In your daily work, you’ll be using a wide range of systems: ZenDesk, Slack, Asana, Zoom, in addition to the Google suite and our in-house CRM and content management system.</p><p>As you join, we’ll train you on all aspects of this job: we’ve got a robust wiki with training resources and best practices, in addition to a seasoned team eager to help you get up-to-speed. Once you’re on top of all ticket types and know Mystery well, you may also have the opportunity to work on projects for other teams in the company.</p><p>This is an opportunity to help more kids stay curious and become the next generation of problem solvers. While your work will be remote from your home office, we meet daily via Zoom as a team, and have weekly company-wide town halls.

We&rsquo;re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our mission. We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.</p><br /><p>Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 30 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Shanghai, Singapore, Romania and North America. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.</p><br /><p>Winnow&rsquo;s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow has now worked with hundreds of sites to reduce food waste, including hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and high street restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for operations.</p><br /><p>As the global leader in addressing food waste, we are committed to continue pushing the envelope on what technology can do to solve this problem. Winnow Vision, our new artificial intelligence-based technology, is trained to automatically track all food waste thrown away. It has won awards at the World Economic Forum and has been received tremendous enthusiasm from our clients and the industry.

With our customers, we challenge them if we don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re achieving their goals, whether they be environmental or financial.</p><br /><p><strong>People of action.</strong>&nbsp;Done is better than perfect, and we learn by boldly doing then rapidly improving. We&rsquo;re breaking new ground, so we know things might go wrong. But we judge ourselves and each other on our reaction and our resilience.</p><br /><p><strong>Bound by food.</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re a diverse bunch, but our belief in the value of food is the common thread in everything we do. With each other, we celebrate through our love and respect for food. With our customers, it means we work hard to develop creative tools to make it easy for chefs to value food.</p><br /><p><strong>Hungry and humble.</strong>&nbsp;Our product is revolutionary, our people are impressive, and we&rsquo;re hungry for change. But, we&rsquo;re just the catalyst for a bigger movement. We stay humble regardless of our success, and make chefs the heroes in this journey.</p><br /><p>This is an opportunity to join a rapidly growing start-up (and one of Wired&rsquo;s top 100 start-ups in Europe) and help us propel our growth at what is truly the most exciting and dynamic points in time in our business.

This role will be a remote-based role keeping Pacific Time hours (9am-5pm Pacific Time).</div><div><br>Empathetic, passionate support-people love working at Mystery.org, because our elementary teacher and homeschool customers are raving fans of our product, and because ours is a company where customer issues get solved at the root, and quickly, so support is less about apologizing, and more about saying, <em>yes we can</em>! Our customer experience specialists work remotely and all (five currently) have been with us for at least a year, forming an engaged, positive team. We don’t just handle typical support requests; we also help with inside sales efforts, and our more experienced team members have become a go-to resource for a wide range of company projects.

Mostly, we respond to customer inquiries via email--helping customers with a wide range of questions, from what lesson to teach next, to how to trouble-shoot video issues, from which of our membership levels to choose, to how to submit a purchase order. However, you’ll also answer inbound phone calls, and support our district partnership team with outbound calls to school or district admins to follow up on quotes they created, or emails that bounce.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>In your daily work, you’ll be using a wide range of systems: ZenDesk, Slack, Asana, Zoom, in addition to the Google suite and our in-house CRM and content management system.&nbsp;</div><div><br>As you join, we’ll train you on all aspects of this job: we’ve got a robust wiki with training resources and best practices, in addition to a seasoned team eager to help you get up-to-speed.

First round phone interviews: 23rd &amp; 27th August 2019</p><br /><p><strong>Start date:</strong>&nbsp;Immediate</p><br /><p><strong>Location:</strong>&nbsp;London, Oxford, or Remote (England)</p><br /><p><strong>Hours:</strong>&nbsp;Full time, Monday-Friday 11:00 &ndash; 19:30</p><br /><p><strong>Salary:</strong>&nbsp;&pound;22,000-&pound;25,000 p.a</p><br /><p><strong>How to apply:</strong>&nbsp;Please email your CV and cover letter in PDF format. Applications without these will not be considered.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - Why</strong>&nbsp;Like it or not, funding plays a critical role in a schools ability to deliver a great education, and we are unfortunately facing a funding cut crisis in the UK, the scale of which hasn&rsquo;t been seen since the WW2. This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve. Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours. Across the UK, connected communities are simply not happening. This is where School Space comes in.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - How</strong>&nbsp;Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays. We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the centre of a thriving community. School Space - Team Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 7 years, and recent success includes investment raises, 30 partner schools, over half a million generated for them. We&rsquo;ve been on the Techstars 2018 Cohort, been nominated for Social Enterprise UK&rsquo;s Social Enterprise of the Year, and picked up a few awards and amazing networks along the way. Our team are committed to the nth degree and full of the belief that social business is the model of the future. We have endless determination to see School Space grow fast and well, scaling our impact across the UK and beyond. In the mix we have Oxbridge graduates, marathon runners, a pilot, industry veterans, an Olympic torch bearer and a man who once ran a marathon with no training/trainers for an onion bhaji.</p><br /><p><strong>The Role</strong>&nbsp;<strong>- Why</strong>&nbsp;We have grown our customer base of wonderful community members hiring our school spaces - and we need amazing, motivated people to help ensure they have a good experience. This is the second hire in this role, as we work towards offering our customers constant support with their experience hiring our venues.</p><br /><p><strong>The Role - How</strong>&nbsp;Key responsibilities include:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Problem solving for our customers, speaking directly with them via email<br />and phone to find a solution to their need (be it positive or negative<br />feedback).</li><br /><li>Proactively spotting patterns in the frustrations or hopes of our customers,<br />seeing where we can change our processes, tools, or product to make them<br />happier.</li><br /><li>Working with our operations team (who manage our school relationships)<br />to ensure we can solve the customer&rsquo;s problems on the spot, and for the<br />future.</li><br /><li>Understanding, prioritising and escalating our customers&amp;#39; feedback and<br />requests to the rest of the team (sales, product development and<br />operations.)</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What we want from you:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills</li><br /><li>A love of customers/people in general and an ability to empathise with their<br />problems, build rapport and leave them satisfied with the solution.</li><br /><li>Resilience - the ability to deal with and thrive on people coming to you with<br />things that are going wrong!</li><br /><li>Strong attention to detail</li><br /><li>Curiosity - you should love investigating awkward problems, getting to the<br />root cause and fixing them</li><br /><li>The ability and desire to work in a fast-paced, challenging environment with<br />peers who challenge you to constantly improve</li><br /><li>An eagerness to take on more responsibility, and you thrive on change - we<br />are a start up and that means things are fast moving.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do<br />not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual<br />orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</p>",

Our friendly community is growing fast, with developers from all over the world learning from each other and working together to make text- and voice-based AI assistants better.</p><p>Rasa's machine learning-based dialogue tools allow developers to automate contextual conversations.

Many of these restaurant chains hire software development teams to create a wide variety of custom applications and websites that integrate with Olo’s APIs. Likewise, the emergence of third party restaurant marketplaces and delivery services has opened new sales channels for restaurant chains, and Olo enables those channels via integrations to our APIs. We also work with a broad array of food delivery providers, POS vendors, and loyalty platform providers who integrate their solutions into the Olo Platform to enable a complete digital ordering experience. Working on Olo’s Developer Support team will give you the opportunity to assist developers from the most innovative and notable tech companies in the food space.\\n\\nOlo is transforming the digital ordering landscape for restaurant chains in an ever-evolving ecosystem, and we're looking for a talented engineer and support specialist to join our team in the role of a Developer Support Engineer to help us achieve our vision.

Specifically, you will answer daily technical questions from a wide variety of integration partners related to the functional behavior of our APIs, and you will investigate and resolve problems they report with their integration.\\n\\nYou will evolve our Developer Portal to provide a complete technical repository of information, documentation, and tools that our partners will use to incorporate Olo online ordering into their products.\\n\\nThis is a unique role that requires a special combination of responsibilities: daily developer support, great documentation writing, and the ability to both interpret and write quality software.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* A passion for computing that extends beyond work\\n\\n* Excellent English writing and communication skills\\n\\n* Enjoys the daily variability of a developer support role and the need to sometimes jump in and help untangle ambiguous problems\\n\\n* At least 3 years on-the-job software development experience\\n\\n* Excellent knowledge of C#, .NET and object oriented concepts\\n\\n* Comfortable in multiple programming languages and frameworks\\n\\n* Experience developing or integrating to a RESTful API\\n\\n* Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)\\n\\n* A good working knowledge of ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS\\n\\n* BS in Computer Science or related field, or comparable industry experience\\n\\n* Legal right to work in the U.S.\\n\\n* Beneficial\\n\\n* Experience in a technical support or developer support role\\n\\n* Experience with technical writing in a software environment\\n\\n* Experience working in Zendesk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Olo\\n\\nOlo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 250 restaurant brands.

Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded website and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.&nbsp;\\n\\nOlo is located on the 82nd floor of One World Trade Center.&nbsp; We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Many of these restaurant chains hire software development teams to create a wide variety of custom applications and websites that integrate with Olo’s APIs. Likewise, the emergence of third party restaurant marketplaces and delivery services has opened new sales channels for restaurant chains, and Olo enables those channels via integrations to our APIs. We also work with a broad array of food delivery providers, POS vendors, and loyalty platform providers who integrate their solutions into the Olo Platform to enable a complete digital ordering experience. Working on Olo’s Developer Support team will give you the opportunity to assist developers from the most innovative and notable tech companies in the food space.</p><p>Olo is transforming the digital ordering landscape for restaurant chains in an ever-evolving ecosystem, and we're looking for a talented engineer and support specialist to join our team in the role of a Developer Support Engineer to help us achieve our vision. You will play a significant and visible role in helping our partners incorporate online ordering into their own applications and solutions. Your primary role will be to provide developer-level support for developers who are integrating to our APIs.

Your success will enable the expansion of the Olo digital ordering universe.</p><p>You'll work with a smart, friendly, and passionate team dedicated to delivering amazing products using modern tools and technologies such as .NET 4.6, ASP.NET MVC 5, TeamCity, GitHub, Octopus Deploy and heavy use of OSS.</p><p>This is a full-time position with expected work hours from 11:00 AM ET to 8:00 PM&nbsp; ET Monday through Friday. Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, by far the majority of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><p>You will serve as a technical interface to our development partners, supporting their ability to incorporate Olo services into their applications and solutions via our APIs. Specifically, you will answer daily technical questions from a wide variety of integration partners related to the functional behavior of our APIs, and you will investigate and resolve problems they report with their integration.</p><p>You will evolve our Developer Portal to provide a complete technical repository of information, documentation, and tools that our partners will use to incorporate Olo online ordering into their products.</p><p>This is a unique role that requires a special combination of responsibilities: daily developer support, great documentation writing, and the ability to both interpret and write quality software.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>A passion for computing that extends beyond work</li><li>Excellent English writing and communication skills</li><li>Enjoys the daily variability of a developer support role and the need to sometimes jump in and help untangle ambiguous problems</li><li>At least 3 years on-the-job software development experience</li><li>Excellent knowledge of C#, .NET and object oriented concepts</li><li>Comfortable in multiple programming languages and frameworks</li><li>Experience developing or integrating to a RESTful API</li><li>Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)</li><li>A good working knowledge of ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS</li><li>BS in Computer Science or related field, or comparable industry experience</li><li>Legal right to work in the U.S.</li><li>Beneficial</li><li>Experience in a technical support or developer support role</li><li>Experience with technical writing in a software environment</li><li>Experience working in Zendesk</li></ul><p><strong>About Olo</strong></p><p>Olo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 250 restaurant brands. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded user interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded website and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Olo is located on the 82nd floor of One World Trade Center.&nbsp; We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

We run our services on cutting edge technology and we are proud of the level of support we offer to our customers. Our talented and motivated team is scattered across the globe with team members hailing from every continent but Antartica! We're constantly on the lookout for great talent to join our awesome team. If you’d like to become part of the Kinsta family, hit apply or drop us a line, we’d love to talk to you!   <br>   <br>Our client base in Germany is growing steadily and we’re looking for a competent support engineer with exceptional communication skills who can provide enterprise level technical support to our customers via our support system.   <br>   <br>Our support team works with our customers using chat and email (we use Intercom.io exclusively for these purposes). As a Kinsta Support Engineer you will:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Take ownership of issues reported by customers and see problems through to resolution.   <br>   <br>* Research, troubleshoot, and identify solutions to resolve customer issues.   <br>   <br>* Follow standard procedures for proper escalation of unresolved issues to the appropriate internal teams.   <br>   <br>* Provide prompt and accurate feedback to customers.   <br>   <br>* Monitor uptime and analyze transactions data using third party analytics tools to resolve more advanced issues.   <br>   <br>* Document troubleshooting and problem resolution steps for internal use and to extend our Knowledge Base.   <br>   <br>* Carefully follow internal documentation to perform website migrations and repair websites infected with malware.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>This role's shift need is&nbsp;Monday-Friday 8am-4pm UTC.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>REQUIREMENTS   <br>   <br>The ideal Kinsta Support Engineer is technically-knowledgeable, upbeat, professional, curious, and self-motivated.   <br>   <br>Excellent support is one of the cornerstones of our business. Our clients have come to expect industry-leading support and it's our pleasure to deliver that to them. As a result, we're pretty careful about adding new Support Engineers to our team.   <br>   <br>We hire Support Engineers with a variety of different areas of expertise - some of us are WordPress developers, others are Linux server gurus, while others are technically-knowledgeable internet generalists who have mastered the art of customer service.   <br>   <br>All of our Engineers must meet the following core requirements:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Completely fluent in English with excellent written communication skills.   <br>   <br>* Completely fluent in German with excellent written communication skills.   <br>   <br>* Capable of thriving in a fast-paced and occasionally stressful environment interacting with multiple clients simultaneously while maintaining a professional and friendly tone.   <br>   <br>* Our Support Engineers must know WordPress deeply. All we host is WordPress and we have the best support team in the business (even if we do say so ourselves). While you don't have to be a full-fledged WordPress developer to be a Kinsta Support Engineer, you do need to know the WordPress database and file/directory structure as well as the wp-config.php file like the back of your hand. Experience with WP-CLI certainly advantageous.   <br>   <br>* A basic understanding of or familiarity with the following technologies: Linux, NGINX, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DNS, CDN, and caching (object and page).   <br>   <br>* Consummate professionalism: we're a distributed team and we expect you to act like the professional we know you are. That means being a member of the Kinsta team requires excellent communication, rock-solid reliability, and the drive to bring your best effort to bear on your work every single day.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Our Support Engineers deal with a lot more than just WordPress! While you don't need to be a full-stack developer to fill this role, you will be providing hosting support to full-stack developers, so you do need to be familiar with the full-stack, from Linux web servers to browser dev tools.   <br>   <br>Bonus points:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Completely fluent in a second language. Languages we're currently targeting include: Italian, French, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Swedish, Finnish, Danish, and Norwegian.&nbsp;If you are fluent in one of these languages please highlight this information when you apply!   <br>   <br>* Deep expertise in any (or all!) of the following: WordPress, Linux, NGINX, PHP and MySQL.   <br>   <br>* Experience setting up, managing, and supporting LEMP/LAMP stacks.   <br>   <br>* Prior experience working with customers over chat in a technical role in a fast-paced environment - particularly experience providing live support for web hosting or WordPress products.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>BENEFITS   <br>   <br>This is a fully-remote role.&nbsp;Our Support Engineers can work from anywhere with reliable internet access.   <br>   <br>We always use the latest version of everything: PHP 7.3, NGINX, Ubuntu 18.04, Linux containers, Google Cloud and more, so you’ll be able to work with a bunch of exciting technologies and use them every day!   <br>   <br>This position offers a great deal of flexibility, responsibility, and opportunity for growth for the right candidate.   <br>   <br>If you want to learn more about Kinsta and what it's like to work for our team, head to our website, Kinsta.com, and look for the About Us link in the footer.  </div> </div>",

We run our services on cutting edge technology and we are proud of the level of support we offer to our customers. Our talented and motivated team is scattered across the globe with team members hailing from every continent but Antartica! We're constantly on the lookout for great talent to join our awesome team. If you’d like to become part of the Kinsta family, hit apply or drop us a line, we’d love to talk to you!   <br>   <br>Our client base in Japan is growing steadily and we’re looking for a competent&nbsp;Support Engineer&nbsp;with exceptional communication skills who can provide enterprise level technical support to our customers via our support system.   <br>   <br>Our support team works with our customers using chat and email (we use Intercom.io exclusively for these purposes). As a&nbsp;Kinsta&nbsp;Support Engineer&nbsp;you will:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Take ownership of issues reported by customers and see problems through to resolution.   <br>   <br>* Research, troubleshoot, and identify solutions to resolve customer issues.   <br>   <br>* Follow standard procedures for proper escalation of unresolved issues to the appropriate internal teams.   <br>   <br>* Provide prompt and accurate feedback to customers.   <br>   <br>* Monitor uptime and analyze transactions data using third-party analytics tools to resolve more advanced issues.   <br>   <br>* Document troubleshooting and problem resolution steps for internal use and extend our Knowledge Base.   <br>   <br>* Carefully follow internal documentation to perform website migrations and repair websites infected with malware.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>This role's shift need is&nbsp;Monday to Friday 12am-8am UTC.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>REQUIREMENTS   <br>   <br>The ideal&nbsp;Kinsta&nbsp;Support Engineer&nbsp;is technically-knowledgeable, upbeat, professional, curious, and self-motivated.   <br>   <br>Excellent support is one of the cornerstones of our business. Our clients have come to expect industry-leading support and it's our pleasure to deliver that to them. As a result, we're pretty careful about adding new&nbsp;Support Engineers&nbsp;to our team.   <br>   <br>We hire&nbsp;Support Engineers with a variety of different areas of expertise - some of us are WordPress developers, others are Linux server gurus, while others are technically-knowledgeable internet generalists who have mastered the art of customer service.   <br>   <br>All of our&nbsp;Engineers&nbsp;must meet the following core requirements:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Completely fluent in English with excellent written communication skills.   <br>   <br>* At least near-native level knowledge in Japanese with excellent written communication skills.   <br>   <br>* Capable of thriving in a fast-paced and occasionally stressful environment interacting with multiple clients simultaneously while maintaining a professional and friendly tone.   <br>   <br>* Our Support Engineers must know WordPress deeply. All we host is WordPress and we have the best support team in the business (even if we do say so ourselves). While you don't have to be a full-fledged WordPress developer to be a Kinsta Support Engineer, you do need to know the WordPress database and file/directory structure as well as the wp-config.php file like the back of your hand. Experience with WP-CLI certainly advantageous.   <br>   <br>* A basic understanding of or familiarity with the following technologies: Linux, NGINX, PHP, MySQL/MariaDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DNS, CDN, and caching (object and page).   <br>   <br>* Consummate professionalism: we're a distributed team and we expect you to act like the professional we know you are. That means being a member of the Kinsta team requires excellent communication, rock-solid reliability, and the drive to bring your best effort to bear on your work every single day.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Our&nbsp;Support Engineers&nbsp;deal with a lot more than just WordPress! While you don't need to be a full-stack developer to fill this role, you will be providing hosting support to full-stack developers, so you do need to be familiar with the full-stack, from Linux web servers to browser dev tools.   <br>   <br>Bonus points:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Deep expertise in any (or all!) of the following: WordPress, Linux, NGINX, PHP and MySQL.   <br>   <br>* Experience setting up, managing, and supporting LEMP/LAMP stacks.   <br>   <br>* Prior experience working with customers over chat in a technical role in a fast-paced environment - particularly experience providing live support for web hosting or WordPress products.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>BENEFITS   <br>   <br>This is a fully-remote role.&nbsp;Our Support Engineers can work from anywhere with reliable internet access.   <br>   <br>We always use the latest version of everything: PHP 7.3, NGINX, Ubuntu 18.04, Linux containers, Google Cloud and more, so you’ll be able to work with a bunch of exciting technologies and use them every day!   <br>   <br>This position offers a great deal of flexibility, responsibility, and opportunity for growth for the right candidate.   <br>   <br>If you want to learn more about Kinsta and what it's like to work for our team, head to our website, Kinsta.com, and look for the About Us link in the footer.  </div> </div>",

We’re the heroes on the frontline and have a deep understanding of our products and our customers. You’ll also be a critical partner to our developers to help them understand where customers are having issues. To deliver the fast, comprehensive, and personal support our customers expect (and deserve), you’ll need to be thoughtful, curious, and a real stickler for details.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  There’s more below on the nitty-gritty of the role, but here’s the short version:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>You’ll love this job if you are energetically curious and delighted to help others.</li>\n  <li>We’ll love you if your a quick learner who’s also enthusiastic, kind, and so reliable that we can set our watches by how regularly you kick ass.</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Not to brag, ahem, but this is a really awesome, full-time job. The benefits are great, the working arrangements are flexible, and your coworkers are all crazy-smart and kind.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>Who should apply?</strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You, probably.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You don’t need a background in tech. You just need to be kind, curious, and a crazy-good writer. What makes our team great are the unique experiences and perspectives each of us brings to the table. Our customers aren’t all the same, so why should we be? If your empathy muscles are strong and your comma splice game is locked down, you belong here.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Don’t believe me? Here’s proof that you don’t need to know the difference between JavaScript and Python (but think they might be related to coffee beans and giant snakes that eat people). Our previous hires for the role include a dog walker, a German translator, an art curator, and a Tiffany. Tiffany defies description.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  One more thing, and this is a big deal: if you are a member of a group that is historically underrepresented and disadvantaged in tech (and society generally), please know that we welcome your application with open and enthusiastically-waving arms. We want to meet you!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  And while we’re on the topic, if you don’t celebrate people’s differences and don’t value the contributions of those who don’t look, sound, or act like you, Harvest isn’t going to be a good fit. When we come to work, we bring our full selves because that contributes to both the vibrancy and richness of our team. So if you want to work here, you should be actively excited about working with a group of people who strive to be inclusive.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>What will your life be like?</strong>&nbsp;(SPOILERS: pretty great, but not always a piece of cake)\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>You’ll learn the ins and outs of Harvest, Harvest Forecast, and are associated apps and integrations through our intensive training program. You’ll become a true Harvest expert (see what we did there?).</li>\n  <li>You’ll answer questions via email and place a few phone calls for the vast majority of your day. That’s the job, mostly. We maintain an industry-leading average response time, with an emphasis on quality rather than quantity of tickets resolved. It’s troubleshooting, bug investigation, teaching, and occasional therapy (“I believe in you!”).</li>\n  <li>You’ll work alongside our developers to figure out thorny problems, and you’ll help our customers through those tricky periods when things don’t work quite right.</li>\n  <li>You’ll build our customer base by using your presentation skills to host webinars for and answer questions from prospective Harvest customers.</li>\n  <li>Once you’ve mastered the software and can answer tickets like a pro (or should we say—like an expert. Gosh, it never gets old!), you’ll have the opportunity to pursue support-related projects on the Expert Team. There are plenty of projects to keep your juices flowing—whether you’re interested in writing documentation, making handy GIFs, or trying something totally new, there’s room to explore!</li>\n  <li>You’ll be a great human person, and treat our customers with sincerity, kindness, and respect. You’ll create new ways to impress, delight, and surprise them!</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <span><br></span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span><b>REQUIREMENTS</b></span>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>You’re an exceptional communicator and you treat people kindly. You can gracefully break down, solve, and explain, even the most complex problems. Listening, talking, and working with people makes you happy.</li>\n  <li>Your writing skills are flawless. We mean it. You must have a savvy style and a firm grip on grammar.</li>\n  <li>You’re a hard worker with a history of getting things done carefully and efficiently. You’re thorough—no detail go unnoticed.</li>\n  <li>You’re self-motivated, but also enjoy contributing to a team.</li>\n  <li>You can de-escalate a tense situation with ease and grace—working through a tough issue or bug with an upset customer not only doesn’t scare you, it’s a challenge you’re eager to take on.</li>\n  <li>You don’t mind doing the same thing most days. You’re also comfortable jumping onto a side project when the occasion arises and aren’t scared to tackle the new and unknown.</li>\n  <li>You’re patient and enjoy solving tough problems, and you find helping people fix those problems rewarding.</li>\n  <li>You are able to work full-time, Monday - Friday from 5am EST - 1pm EST or 6am - 2pm EST.</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>When You Apply</strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Tell us a bit about yourself and why you you’d make a great Harvest Expert.</li>\n  <li>Let us know what working hours you are able to commit to (and in what timezone).</li>\n  <li>You’re awesome and can work anywhere… why Harvest?</li>\n  <li>Harvest HQ is home to a record player. What album would you contribute to our vinyl collection?</li>\n  <li>We made six grammatical mistakes or typos in this job post. Be sure to let us know what they are!</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <em><br></em>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <em>Applications will be reviewed in weekly batches.

Here’s why…</p>\n <p>My name is George Karanastasis. I’m the founder and CEO of Fisico. We’re a natural health company that sells supplements and nutrition programs online.</p>\n <p>And we’re currently looking for an A-player to join our team and help assist our AMAZING customers. I’ll share the details of the position in a moment. First, a bit about our ideal candidate (please read every word the follows).</p>\n <p>In a nutshell, it’s <strong>someone who has worked in – or is currently working in – a virtual position (i.e. highly self-disciplined and can get the job done with minimal supervision)</strong>.</p>\n <p><strong>Furthermore, the ideal candidate is…</strong></p>\n <ol>\n  <li>Reliable. I’m talking about very reliable. Not the, <em>“This usually doesn’t happen, but it happened again”</em> type. We’re a small team and everyone must pull their weight. That means showing up every day and on time — no exceptions (save for a major emergency).</li>\n  <li>A natural with people (i.e. very personable and someone who easily makes conversation — even with a perfect stranger). Furthermore, it’s someone who loves talking to and helping customers.</li>\n  <li>Experienced and comfortable with taking incoming calls/making outgoing calls.</li>\n  <li>Patient, kind, and courteous. The words, “please” and “thank you” should be your “go-to” words when communicating with a customer.</li>\n  <li>Happy to perform repetitive tasks and answering the same core group of questions day-in and day-out.</li>\n  <li>Is fairly tech-savvy. Nothing advanced but you must know your way around Email clients, Microsoft Office, and apps like Skype.</li>\n  <li>Fast at typing (at least 50 WPM).</li>\n  <li>Highly organized, and can multi-task with ease. The ideal candidate likely works off checklists and makes sure repetitive tasks are completed with pinpoint accuracy.</li>\n  <li>Detail orientated. Glossing over things just won’t do. In fact, try this. At the bottom of this ad you’ll find a link to an application. When you’re done reading the entire ad (and only then) click through and fill it out. The last section asks you to provide additional comments or feedback. Go ahead and write the name of your favorite song in there.</li>\n  <li>Cool and relaxed but always pushing to get things done. It’s important that you take responsibility and your main focus is always delivering results.</li>\n </ol>\n <p><strong>Does <u>all of the above</u> describe you? Great, then keep reading for the job description…</strong></p>\n <p><strong>The main components of the work would be:</strong></p>\n <ol>\n  <li>Responding to every one of our customer’s inquiries via telephone and email (online ticketing system) in a timely fashion. Typical scenarios include tracking lost packages, helping people log on to our website, issuing instructions for returns, and answering basic health questions after learning our products inside and out.</li>\n  <li>Making sure every customer is fully satisfied with the proposed resolution you put forth. And above all, keeping your cool and remaining professional when conflicts inevitably arise. If you don’t have thick skin, this position is probably not for you. Here’s why…The overwhelming majority of our customers are a pleasure to deal with. But on occasion, you will interface with someone that is irate, or rarely, even hostile. Whether justifiably so, or not, it is your duty to make things right and turn them into a raving fan.</li>\n  <li>Processing credits for customers who choose to return items.</li>\n  <li>Communicating with our fulfillment team to identify and correct mistakes with shipments.</li>\n  <li>As well as several other administrative/web-based tasks related to customer care…</li>\n </ol>\n <p><strong>This is a full-time, work from home position. </strong></p>\n <p>OK, if you’re still reading this, there’s a chance you could be a fit for this position. Again, we’re looking for a dependable, detail-orientated, and easy-going (yet professional) person to join our team. If you’re confident you’re a fit, then please let me know by visiting the link below and submitting an application.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://www.fisicoinc.com/jobs/customer-support.php' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

    "content": "We’re looking for a highly organised operations associate to join our team and help provide an incredible ordering experience to our users.\n<br>\n<br>At Thread, we’re helping people to feel happier and more self-confident by making it easy to dress well. We do this using a combination of human stylists and powerful machine learning algorithms to recommend each guy the perfect things just for them—in their size, budget, and style—which they can then buy in one place.\n<br>\n<br>*Operations at Thread*\n<br>\n<br>Making it easy to dress well - and building a business around it - requires operational excellence. Our goal is to create a seamless end-to-end experience, from discovering the perfect item to having it delivered quickly and easily to a place of your choice. Our operations team is critical to this goal, focused on providing our users with an amazing post-purchase experience. We’re looking for an outstanding ops associate with strong administrative skills to help us continue to improve. You will be an important part of this small, dynamic and friendly team. Your role will be fast paced and varied but you’ll execute tasks in a way that makes things seem effortless for our users. If you are highly organised, fast paced, reliable, resilient and keen, this role could be for you. \n<br>\n<br>*The role:*\n<br>\n<br>Your role will be split across two areas of responsibility. Firstly, you’ll be responsible for placing orders with our third party suppliers, making sure that the orders are accurate and sent before the appropriate cut-off time. Secondly, you’ll be the first point of contact for customers with queries about Thread. You’ll either investigate and resolve these queries, or escalate them to a senior team member where appropriate. \n<br>\n<br>After initial training sessions in our office in Aldgate, you’ll be able to work remotely most of the time. We might ask you to come to our office occasionally for training sessions. The role guarantees a minimum of 10 to 15 hours a week (spread across morning, day and evening shifts on weekdays and weekends), with frequent opportunities to pick up more hours on top of that. We’re happy to negotiate the hours and shift times in line with our requirements. We’re currently particularly keen for someone who has the flexibility to do a shift or two on weekends as well as day shifts on weekdays. \n<br>\n<br>*Your core responsibilities will include:*\n<br>\n<br>* First point of contact for our users - field all queries coming through to our support ticketing system and decide on the best pathway for each.\n<br>* Resolve queries and issues efficiently and to a high standard. Make sure our users come away feeling like they had a mindblowing customer experience.\n<br>* Contribute towards hitting our support response time and customer satisfaction targets.\n<br>* Own resolving tickets regarding fulfilment problems, technical issues, feedback and more.\n<br>* Identify and escalate issues to other teams within the company, including senior ops associates, styling, product and engineering.\n<br>* Advocate for users internally by passing on their feedback and pain-points to the wider team.\n<br>* Ensure the smooth running of our “just in time” fulfilment process by placing orders with suppliers in line with cut-off times.\n<br>* Own hitting our buying cut-off targets, and contribute directly to our shipping time targets.\n<br>\n<br>*Are you the one? You are, if you:*\n<br>\n<br>* Possess a collaborative “whatever it takes” attitude; be someone who won’t give up until a problem is fixed and who’s not afraid to push and lead others to a resolution.\n<br>* Excel at finding ways to get around a problem; at times you won’t have the answer you need straight away and will need to think on your feet.\n<br>* Have superb attention to detail; nothing gets past you.\n<br>* Constantly think about how we can improve our processes; never be satisfied with a process that isn’t perfect.\n<br>* Have excellent organisational skills. You make great notes and leave a clear path for others to follow.\n<br>* Are known for being reliable to your core. Your friends and previous employers would describe you as totally dependable.\n<br>* Possess exceptional communication skills, being both professional and effective over email.\n<br>* Are comfortable working across different platforms and channels of communication. You don’t have to be a computer pro, but you’re confident jumping from the support dashboard to the buying page, from your email to a spreadsheet.\n<br>\n<br>*Benefits:*\n<br>\n<br>* This is a flexible role in which you’re welcome to work remotely for most of your hours.\n<br>* You’ll be working closely with the core ops team and will be involved in the smooth running of our support and buying shifts.\n<br>* You’ll get first-hand experience of the day to day workings of the operations team in a tech start-up.\n<br>* Competitive compensation: £10/hour, plus holiday and sick pay.\n<br>\n<br>*How to apply:*\n<br>\n<br>Email us with your CV and a cover letter, and we’ll be in touch!",

We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct&nbsp;.</p>\n<a href='https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct' rel='nofollow'>here</a>\n<p>Why You Should Join</p>\n<p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p>\n<p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p>\n<p>Where We Can Hire</p>\n<p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/e5ce7220-d249-4a01-b075-eceae6872cd8' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>\n</div>",

It’s really very, very significant.”</h3>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Elon Musk</li>\n </ul>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Once a fringe thing hippies did, “going solar” is now going mainstream. It took over 30 years for the first 1 million solar installations to be completed. It only took another 3 years to install the second million. Over the next 2 years another 1 million homes will “go solar” and there are 90 million American households to go after that! Solar technology is cheaper, better and more reliable than ever. Unless your head is buried in a coal mine, it’s becoming abundantly clear that solar is the future.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  With rapid growth &amp; mainstream adoption comes massive investment and opportunity in the space. Installation companies are growing quickly, making them hungry for even more growth. The technology is dialed, the installation process is clean, but it’s still a challenge to find customers. Since customers that convert into sales are the lifeblood of any company, sales leads are the raw tool that unleashes massive growth for solar installers.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  That’s why we built SolarLeadFactory.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4>About Us:</h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  SolarLeadFactory has helped over 511,000 homeowners looking to buy solar. We have helped hundreds of solar installers grow their businesses - and aim to help thousands more.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Our business is built on a proprietary software platform allowing us to deliver a best in class product and innovate constantly. We have in-house developers, digital marketing experts &amp; scientists relentlessly driving the product forward.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Our mission: to unlock consumer demand for solar power.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4>About You:</h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You’re looking for a way to make a huge positive difference in the world &amp; help the companies on the front lines of the solar revolution!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You want to be part of a small but driven team making a big impact on one of the most pressing issues of our time. You share some of our core values including “Making Learning the Key Metric”, “Holding Yourself Accountable”, “Always be Testing Something,” and “Master your Craft”.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Customer success is critical to our internal mission &amp; goals and to the industry as a whole.
