    "content": "*About us:*<br /><br />Charlie Casey (CEO) and Dave Clark (CTO) founded LoyaltyLion in 2012, with one clear mission: to help retailers succeed in the age of Amazon. They saw that retailers could never compete with Amazon on price or logistics. But they could offer a better customer experience. One that made customers feel valued, rather than like they were just another number. <br /><br />Getting to today wasn’t easy. The founders spent 12 months doing some serious bootstrapping – using a friend’s lounge as an office, renting the cheapest accommodation (it had no bathroom!) and taking government loans to make LoyaltyLion a success. Happy to say it’s paying off. <br /><br />Today, thousands of fast-growth ecommerce merchants use LoyaltyLion to power their loyalty programs and we have offices in the UK and the USA. <br /><br /><br />*Role:*<br /><br />As a Senior Customer Success Manager you’ll provide strategic loyalty advice to our largest clients (don’t worry, we’ll train you :). You’ll advise them on their launch strategy and how to optimise their programs over time. You’ll also work on renewals. <br /><br />Most of our clients are US based, so we are looking for someone to work US hours. The exact hours are negotiable, but something like 5pm to midnight, would be brilliant. We are flexible with working arrangements (ie. working from home, working part of the day in the office and the rest at home). <br /><br />You’ll be joining a team of three who are all passionate about customer happiness. We currently have exceptionally high customer retention because of the care and time we invest into our client relationships. We’re never satisfied though and we want you to come with your own ideas on how to offer the best post sale customer experience. <br /><br /><br />*Here are some of the activities you’ll be doing:*<br /><br />* Advising merchants on their loyalty launch strategy <br />* Speaking with merchants on a quarterly basis to provide loyalty recommendations<br />* Agreeing contract renewals <br />* Answering support queries when needed <br /><br /><br />*What we're looking for:*<br /><br />Someone who genuinely cares about customer happiness and goes above and beyond to help them succeed.  More about what we want:<br /><br />* Proven experience in software account management <br />* Natural multi-tasker<br />* Impeccable written English <br />* Professionalism in all areas of work<br />* Ability to build rapport, especially in difficult situations <br />* Willingness to work flexible hours - some of our clients are US based  <br />* Desire to make your mark in a fast growth startup<br /><br /><br />*What we offer:*<br /><br />* Opportunity to join a fast growth startup early and at an exciting time - we have doubled the team size in the past 6 months <br />* Flexible working arrangements<br />* Autonomy -  we encourage this<br />* Opportunity to make an impact - we’re a team of 20 so your efforts will make a visible change<br />* Solid existing team<br />* Warehouse office in central London with some great usual startup perks: free lunch Mondays, Beer Fridays, table football and the not so usual - HTC Vive - the best virtual reality in the world and an office favourite :)<br /><br /><br /><br />*To apply:* <br /><br />Please send your CV and a short cover email or apply via our company &quot;careers page&quot;:https://loyaltylion.com/jobs",

Our datasets include tens of terabytes of content spread across multiple data centres, which can be quite challenging and time-consuming when developing features and products. Our team is tasked with designing and implementing a PaaS-like robust, distributed storage component that can easily be leveraged to speed up new user-facing features and products.</li><li>Session management service. Privacy is of great concern to Wikipedia’s communities. By isolating session management into a separate service, we are minimising the attack surface and increasing the security of our systems.</li><li>Event propagation and dependency tracking. While the number of direct edits is rather small, they can cause updates to several million pages at once. Hence, our infrastructure must be able to reliably update the databases and HTML representations and purge content from the caches at large scale. &nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Requirements</strong></strong></p><ul><li>You have experience building large-scale server applications.</li><ul><li>You think about clusters, caching and latencies</li><li>You are familiar with issues in large-scale systems and are eager to learn new technology</li></ul><li>You are familiar with a diverse set of programming languages and have a solid understanding of core engineering concepts:</li><ul><li>Unix process and concurrency models</li><li>Server application deployment and infrastructure automation</li><li>Relational &amp; distributed databases (e.g. MySQL, Cassandra, Riak, HBase, DynamoDB)</li><li>Principles of fault tolerance and security</li></ul><li>With freedom comes responsibility; you direct your own work and are proactive in seeking input</li><li>You have a scientific mindset and empirically test your hypotheses</li><li>BS, MS, or PhD in Computer Science or equivalent work experience</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Pluses</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Familiarity with Node.js</li><li>Experience with contributing to open source software and free culture</li><li>Self-organised, with experience in working in a geographically-distributed environment</li><li>You know what it means to be a volunteer or to coordinate the work of volunteers</li><li>Big ups if you are a contributor to Wikipedia and/or its sister projects</li></ul><p>Show us your stuff!

Founded in 2010, we set out to make Git’s powerful feature set accessible to developers, designers, and non-technical people.</p><p><strong>Today, our software Tower is the best Git client for Mac and Windows and is used by over 100,000 customers - from startups to Fortune 100 companies.</strong></p><p>We know we can achieve great goals only with the help of our peers. And at fournova, we are blessed to work in a team of extraordinary people. We’re not looking for someone to do the job. We’re looking for someone to join the team.</p><h3>Values at fournova</h3><p>We are a team driven by values. Not the ones that look nice on a poster, but ones that are truly and honestly lived.</p><ul><li><p><strong>TRUST</strong>&nbsp;- We believe our colleagues make good &amp; fair decisions. For example when they take as many vacation days as they need (there's no maximum number of holidays, but a minimum of 24 days). Or when they handle company money responsibly (you can make any purchases without asking for permission). We don't control or micro-manage people.</p></li><li><p><strong>RELIABILITY</strong>&nbsp;- At fournova, you're allowed to make any decision. Even if it's outside of your typical scope of duty. As a consequence, however, you also have to accept responsibility. We rely on our teammates to do their very best work.</p></li><li><p><strong>RESPECT</strong>&nbsp;- We have a deep and sincere respect for each other. Both on a professional and on a personal level. We know we can achieve great goals only with the help of our peers.</p></li><li><p><strong>HUMILITY</strong>&nbsp;- We do what's best for the team. This shows when you're supporting a team decision even if you'd prefer something else. And this shows when making profits: we donate 10% to a good cause every year.</p></li><li><p><strong>HEALTH</strong>&nbsp;- We require everyone to give 100%. But not more than that! Working long hours or weekends is rarely seen at fournova. If you want, you can even choose to work only a 4-day week. We encourage you to pursue a life beyond work!</p></li><li><p><strong>PRAGMATISM</strong>&nbsp;- We concentrate on the tasks that matter. Many things at fournova could be improved. But reality limits our time and energy in a painful way. To get meaningful work done, we need to live with countless little annoyances and concentrate on the things that bring us forward.</p></li><li><p><strong>GROWTH</strong>&nbsp;- All of us have a strong desire to grow. And fournova wants to help you achieve this. On the professional and on the personal, human level.</p></li><li><p><strong>REMOTE WORK</strong>&nbsp;- We are strong believers in freedom &amp; flexibility. Therefore, you can work from wherever you want. In order to keep in touch, however, we meet in person at least once every quarter: for our &quot;General Assemblies&quot; in Frankfurt or Berlin, and for our great team retreats in places like Corsica or Barcelona.</p></li></ul><p>Is this a culture that resonates with you? Can you contribute something to make fournova even better? Yes and yes? Then please get in touch with us!</p>",

What’s more important to us is that you have some experience dealing with (or working in) large-ish companies, you are great at managing relationships, and that you have a bit of a flair for producing written content.<br /><br />*What we do:* <br />It seems quite grand but we really do transform the way that business people work, learn and grow as professionals, with Looop’s innovative Digital Learning Platform and methodology. And we do this working with some of the most progressive and well-known companies in the world. <br /><br />*Who we are:*<br />Looop is a post-revenue, high-growth technology start-up, which means (in real language) we've done the really hard bit, turning a great idea into a business, and now we're growing the team to build on our initial success!<br /><br />Since 2014, we've been challenging the Learning & Development (L&D) industry to catch up with the way that technology enhances our daily lives: to ditch rubbish e-learning and keep out of the training room! By doing this, L&D can help everybody be better at their jobs and take on exciting new roles.<br /><br />Our customers are not just companies who pay us in exchange for tech. We build deep relationships with the brilliant people at ASOS, Amazon, Sky, Financial Times, and more, and they rely on us for thought-leading, practical support to get better results through their Learning & Development.<br /><br />As people, we are experts at what we do, driven to make a difference, and friends who like working with each other. We challenge and support each other to be the best we can be and celebrate the many successes we have along the way.<br /><br />*The exciting new role in our team:*<br />Our customers have come to rely on our expertise and responsiveness and we are looking for someone to help them with this.

For this reason, we need somebody with at least some experience of working in a corporate environment. <br /><br />Developing ‘content’ is also a core element of this role, which will mean designing and building of learning resources as well as gaining high user-engagement, with the skills for this including writing, basic video production and running marketing campaigns.<br /><br />*You are:*<br />Real customer success comes from the heart.  You believe in what you do and are passionate about engaging people and driving positive change in business through the use of innovative technology.
