Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Many of these restaurant chains hire software development teams to create a wide variety of custom applications and websites that integrate with Olo’s APIs. Likewise, the emergence of third party restaurant marketplaces and delivery services has opened new sales channels for restaurant chains, and Olo enables those channels via integrations to our APIs. We also work with a broad array of food delivery providers, POS vendors, and loyalty platform providers who integrate their solutions into the Olo Platform to enable a complete digital ordering experience. Working on Olo’s Developer Support team will give you the opportunity to assist developers from the most innovative and notable tech companies in the food space.\\n\\nOlo is transforming the digital ordering landscape for restaurant chains in an ever-evolving ecosystem, and we're looking for a talented engineer and support specialist to join our team in the role of a Developer Support Engineer to help us achieve our vision.

Specifically, you will answer daily technical questions from a wide variety of integration partners related to the functional behavior of our APIs, and you will investigate and resolve problems they report with their integration.\\n\\nYou will evolve our Developer Portal to provide a complete technical repository of information, documentation, and tools that our partners will use to incorporate Olo online ordering into their products.\\n\\nThis is a unique role that requires a special combination of responsibilities: daily developer support, great documentation writing, and the ability to both interpret and write quality software.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* A passion for computing that extends beyond work\\n\\n* Excellent English writing and communication skills\\n\\n* Enjoys the daily variability of a developer support role and the need to sometimes jump in and help untangle ambiguous problems\\n\\n* At least 3 years on-the-job software development experience\\n\\n* Excellent knowledge of C#, .NET and object oriented concepts\\n\\n* Comfortable in multiple programming languages and frameworks\\n\\n* Experience developing or integrating to a RESTful API\\n\\n* Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)\\n\\n* A good working knowledge of ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS\\n\\n* BS in Computer Science or related field, or comparable industry experience\\n\\n* Legal right to work in the U.S.\\n\\n* Beneficial\\n\\n* Experience in a technical support or developer support role\\n\\n* Experience with technical writing in a software environment\\n\\n* Experience working in Zendesk\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Olo\\n\\nOlo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 250 restaurant brands.

Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded website and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.&nbsp;\\n\\nOlo is located on the 82nd floor of One World Trade Center.&nbsp; We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Many of these restaurant chains hire software development teams to create a wide variety of custom applications and websites that integrate with Olo’s APIs. Likewise, the emergence of third party restaurant marketplaces and delivery services has opened new sales channels for restaurant chains, and Olo enables those channels via integrations to our APIs. We also work with a broad array of food delivery providers, POS vendors, and loyalty platform providers who integrate their solutions into the Olo Platform to enable a complete digital ordering experience. Working on Olo’s Developer Support team will give you the opportunity to assist developers from the most innovative and notable tech companies in the food space.</p><p>Olo is transforming the digital ordering landscape for restaurant chains in an ever-evolving ecosystem, and we're looking for a talented engineer and support specialist to join our team in the role of a Developer Support Engineer to help us achieve our vision. You will play a significant and visible role in helping our partners incorporate online ordering into their own applications and solutions. Your primary role will be to provide developer-level support for developers who are integrating to our APIs. You will also be responsible for improving our Developer Portal (where integration partners manage their API projects), API documentation, and associated tools needed to provide an exceptional integration experience. Your success will enable the expansion of the Olo digital ordering universe.</p><p>You'll work with a smart, friendly, and passionate team dedicated to delivering amazing products using modern tools and technologies such as .NET 4.6, ASP.NET MVC 5, TeamCity, GitHub, Octopus Deploy and heavy use of OSS.</p><p>This is a full-time position with expected work hours from 11:00 AM ET to 8:00 PM&nbsp; ET Monday through Friday. Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, by far the majority of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><p>You will serve as a technical interface to our development partners, supporting their ability to incorporate Olo services into their applications and solutions via our APIs. Specifically, you will answer daily technical questions from a wide variety of integration partners related to the functional behavior of our APIs, and you will investigate and resolve problems they report with their integration.</p><p>You will evolve our Developer Portal to provide a complete technical repository of information, documentation, and tools that our partners will use to incorporate Olo online ordering into their products.</p><p>This is a unique role that requires a special combination of responsibilities: daily developer support, great documentation writing, and the ability to both interpret and write quality software.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>A passion for computing that extends beyond work</li><li>Excellent English writing and communication skills</li><li>Enjoys the daily variability of a developer support role and the need to sometimes jump in and help untangle ambiguous problems</li><li>At least 3 years on-the-job software development experience</li><li>Excellent knowledge of C#, .NET and object oriented concepts</li><li>Comfortable in multiple programming languages and frameworks</li><li>Experience developing or integrating to a RESTful API</li><li>Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)</li><li>A good working knowledge of ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS</li><li>BS in Computer Science or related field, or comparable industry experience</li><li>Legal right to work in the U.S.</li><li>Beneficial</li><li>Experience in a technical support or developer support role</li><li>Experience with technical writing in a software environment</li><li>Experience working in Zendesk</li></ul><p><strong>About Olo</strong></p><p>Olo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 250 restaurant brands. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded user interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded website and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>Olo is located on the 82nd floor of One World Trade Center.&nbsp; We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

Running such a platform is not for the faint of heart.</p><p>Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry, full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a relatively small team of smart, senior engineers who all get along.&nbsp;</p><p>We're super DevOps oriented and like to automate and build tools for everything. We use Continuous Integration and push frequently.&nbsp;</p><p>We dedicate time to refactoring to reduce technical debt and to introduce newer technologies.

We’re the heroes on the frontline and have a deep understanding of our products and our customers. You’ll also be a critical partner to our developers to help them understand where customers are having issues. To deliver the fast, comprehensive, and personal support our customers expect (and deserve), you’ll need to be thoughtful, curious, and a real stickler for details.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  There’s more below on the nitty-gritty of the role, but here’s the short version:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>You’ll love this job if you are energetically curious and delighted to help others.</li>\n  <li>We’ll love you if your a quick learner who’s also enthusiastic, kind, and so reliable that we can set our watches by how regularly you kick ass.</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Not to brag, ahem, but this is a really awesome, full-time job. The benefits are great, the working arrangements are flexible, and your coworkers are all crazy-smart and kind.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>Who should apply?</strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You, probably.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You don’t need a background in tech. You just need to be kind, curious, and a crazy-good writer. What makes our team great are the unique experiences and perspectives each of us brings to the table. Our customers aren’t all the same, so why should we be? If your empathy muscles are strong and your comma splice game is locked down, you belong here.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Don’t believe me? Here’s proof that you don’t need to know the difference between JavaScript and Python (but think they might be related to coffee beans and giant snakes that eat people). Our previous hires for the role include a dog walker, a German translator, an art curator, and a Tiffany. Tiffany defies description.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  One more thing, and this is a big deal: if you are a member of a group that is historically underrepresented and disadvantaged in tech (and society generally), please know that we welcome your application with open and enthusiastically-waving arms. We want to meet you!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  And while we’re on the topic, if you don’t celebrate people’s differences and don’t value the contributions of those who don’t look, sound, or act like you, Harvest isn’t going to be a good fit. When we come to work, we bring our full selves because that contributes to both the vibrancy and richness of our team.

You’ll become a true Harvest expert (see what we did there?).</li>\n  <li>You’ll answer questions via email and place a few phone calls for the vast majority of your day. That’s the job, mostly. We maintain an industry-leading average response time, with an emphasis on quality rather than quantity of tickets resolved. It’s troubleshooting, bug investigation, teaching, and occasional therapy (“I believe in you!”).</li>\n  <li>You’ll work alongside our developers to figure out thorny problems, and you’ll help our customers through those tricky periods when things don’t work quite right.</li>\n  <li>You’ll build our customer base by using your presentation skills to host webinars for and answer questions from prospective Harvest customers.</li>\n  <li>Once you’ve mastered the software and can answer tickets like a pro (or should we say—like an expert.

You’re thorough—no detail go unnoticed.</li>\n  <li>You’re self-motivated, but also enjoy contributing to a team.</li>\n  <li>You can de-escalate a tense situation with ease and grace—working through a tough issue or bug with an upset customer not only doesn’t scare you, it’s a challenge you’re eager to take on.</li>\n  <li>You don’t mind doing the same thing most days. You’re also comfortable jumping onto a side project when the occasion arises and aren’t scared to tackle the new and unknown.</li>\n  <li>You’re patient and enjoy solving tough problems, and you find helping people fix those problems rewarding.</li>\n  <li>You are able to work full-time, Monday - Friday from 5am EST - 1pm EST or 6am - 2pm EST.</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <strong><br></strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>When You Apply</strong>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Tell us a bit about yourself and why you you’d make a great Harvest Expert.</li>\n  <li>Let us know what working hours you are able to commit to (and in what timezone).</li>\n  <li>You’re awesome and can work anywhere… why Harvest?</li>\n  <li>Harvest HQ is home to a record player.

Here’s why…</p>\n <p>My name is George Karanastasis. I’m the founder and CEO of Fisico. We’re a natural health company that sells supplements and nutrition programs online.</p>\n <p>And we’re currently looking for an A-player to join our team and help assist our AMAZING customers. I’ll share the details of the position in a moment. First, a bit about our ideal candidate (please read every word the follows).</p>\n <p>In a nutshell, it’s <strong>someone who has worked in – or is currently working in – a virtual position (i.e. highly self-disciplined and can get the job done with minimal supervision)</strong>.</p>\n <p><strong>Furthermore, the ideal candidate is…</strong></p>\n <ol>\n  <li>Reliable. I’m talking about very reliable. Not the, <em>“This usually doesn’t happen, but it happened again”</em> type. We’re a small team and everyone must pull their weight. That means showing up every day and on time — no exceptions (save for a major emergency).</li>\n  <li>A natural with people (i.e. very personable and someone who easily makes conversation — even with a perfect stranger). Furthermore, it’s someone who loves talking to and helping customers.</li>\n  <li>Experienced and comfortable with taking incoming calls/making outgoing calls.</li>\n  <li>Patient, kind, and courteous. The words, “please” and “thank you” should be your “go-to” words when communicating with a customer.</li>\n  <li>Happy to perform repetitive tasks and answering the same core group of questions day-in and day-out.</li>\n  <li>Is fairly tech-savvy. Nothing advanced but you must know your way around Email clients, Microsoft Office, and apps like Skype.</li>\n  <li>Fast at typing (at least 50 WPM).</li>\n  <li>Highly organized, and can multi-task with ease. The ideal candidate likely works off checklists and makes sure repetitive tasks are completed with pinpoint accuracy.</li>\n  <li>Detail orientated. Glossing over things just won’t do. In fact, try this. At the bottom of this ad you’ll find a link to an application. When you’re done reading the entire ad (and only then) click through and fill it out. The last section asks you to provide additional comments or feedback. Go ahead and write the name of your favorite song in there.</li>\n  <li>Cool and relaxed but always pushing to get things done. It’s important that you take responsibility and your main focus is always delivering results.</li>\n </ol>\n <p><strong>Does <u>all of the above</u> describe you? Great, then keep reading for the job description…</strong></p>\n <p><strong>The main components of the work would be:</strong></p>\n <ol>\n  <li>Responding to every one of our customer’s inquiries via telephone and email (online ticketing system) in a timely fashion. Typical scenarios include tracking lost packages, helping people log on to our website, issuing instructions for returns, and answering basic health questions after learning our products inside and out.</li>\n  <li>Making sure every customer is fully satisfied with the proposed resolution you put forth. And above all, keeping your cool and remaining professional when conflicts inevitably arise. If you don’t have thick skin, this position is probably not for you. Here’s why…The overwhelming majority of our customers are a pleasure to deal with. But on occasion, you will interface with someone that is irate, or rarely, even hostile.

You are, if you:*\n<br>\n<br>* Possess a collaborative “whatever it takes” attitude; be someone who won’t give up until a problem is fixed and who’s not afraid to push and lead others to a resolution.\n<br>* Excel at finding ways to get around a problem; at times you won’t have the answer you need straight away and will need to think on your feet.\n<br>* Have superb attention to detail; nothing gets past you.\n<br>* Constantly think about how we can improve our processes; never be satisfied with a process that isn’t perfect.\n<br>* Have excellent organisational skills. You make great notes and leave a clear path for others to follow.\n<br>* Are known for being reliable to your core. Your friends and previous employers would describe you as totally dependable.\n<br>* Possess exceptional communication skills, being both professional and effective over email.\n<br>* Are comfortable working across different platforms and channels of communication. You don’t have to be a computer pro, but you’re confident jumping from the support dashboard to the buying page, from your email to a spreadsheet.\n<br>\n<br>*Benefits:*\n<br>\n<br>* This is a flexible role in which you’re welcome to work remotely for most of your hours.\n<br>* You’ll be working closely with the core ops team and will be involved in the smooth running of our support and buying shifts.\n<br>* You’ll get first-hand experience of the day to day workings of the operations team in a tech start-up.\n<br>* Competitive compensation: £10/hour, plus holiday and sick pay.\n<br>\n<br>*How to apply:*\n<br>\n<br>Email us with your CV and a cover letter, and we’ll be in touch!",

Our systems are critical to software engineers all over the world and used in every industry; from the public registry, which serves packages to open source engineers and small organizations, to our new enterprise solution, which provides single tenant registries for medium and large customers.</p>\n<p>We are looking for a Support Technician who is passionate about helping customers solve technical problems with patience and empathy. You will be directly interacting with our most important asset – our javascript community!&nbsp; You will also have the ability to potentially influence the development of administrative tooling, both internal and externally facing. This role reports to the Support Manager.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Key responsibilities include</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Building close relationships with customers and use knowledge of the market to inform product evolution</li>\n<li>Addressing support tickets submitted by customers with a myriad of technical ability and backgrounds</li>\n<li>Triaging and evaluating the severity of tickets assigned daily</li>\n<li>Working with other support team members to positively resolve customer issues and concerns</li>\n<li>Working occasionally with the product and development team to communicate tooling opportunities that will benefit the customer and also the support team</li>\n<li>Acting as a liaison between customers to facilitate communication</li>\n<li>Occasionally documenting solutions to use for our internal knowledge base</li>\n<p></p>\n<strong>We would prefer that you have experience with the following</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Zendesk</li>\n<li>Technical support</li>\n<li>Working on a distributed team</li>\n<li>Familiarity with using a command line</li>\n<p></p>\n<strong>It would be nice if you have the following</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>npm command line or website experience</li>\n<li>Prior experience working with a distributed team</li>\n<li>Familiarity with the Javascript community</li>\n<li>At least two years working with customers in a technical support capacity</li>\n<li>IT Support Professional certification</li>\n<li>Bachelor’s degree or equivalent work experience</li>\n<p>Our Code of Conduct</p>\n<p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct&nbsp;.</p>\n<a href='https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct' rel='nofollow'>here</a>\n<p>Why You Should Join</p>\n<p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p>\n<p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p>\n<p>Where We Can Hire</p>\n<p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/e5ce7220-d249-4a01-b075-eceae6872cd8' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>\n</div>",

Over the next 2 years another 1 million homes will “go solar” and there are 90 million American households to go after that! Solar technology is cheaper, better and more reliable than ever.

It took over 30 years for the first 1 million solar installations to be completed. It only took another 3 years to install the second million. Over the next 2 years another 1 million homes will “go solar” and there are 90 million American households to go after that! Solar technology is cheaper, better and more reliable than ever. Unless your head is buried in a coal mine, it’s becoming abundantly clear that solar is the future.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  With rapid growth &amp; mainstream adoption comes massive investment and opportunity in the space. Installation companies are growing quickly, making them hungry for even more growth. The technology is dialed, the installation process is clean, but it’s still a challenge to find customers. Since customers that convert into sales are the lifeblood of any company, sales leads are the raw tool that unleashes massive growth for solar installers.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  That’s why we built SolarLeadFactory.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4>About Us:</h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  SolarLeadFactory has helped over 511,000 homeowners looking to buy solar.

With over half a million downloads since launch, our open source tools are loved by developers worldwide, and Rasa runs in production everywhere from startups to Fortune 500s. Our friendly community is growing fast, with developers from all over the world learning from each other and working together to make text- and voice-based AI assistants better. \n  <br> \n  <br>Rasa's machine learning-based dialogue tools allow developers to automate contextual conversations. What are contextual conversations? Real back-and-forth dialogue that is handled seamlessly. Taking AI assistants beyond fixed question / answer pairs creates exciting new use cases for people and business. The tip of the iceberg includes automation of sales &amp; marketing, internal processes, and advanced customer service that integrates into existing backend systems. With Rasa, companies control their own destiny, investing in AI that they own and ship instead of relying on third parties. \n  <br> \n  <br>Rasa has raised $14 million in total funding from Accel, Basis Set Ventures and open source founders such as Ross Mason (MuleSoft), Mitchell Hashimoto (Hashicorp) and Florian Leibert (Mesosphere).

    "content": "<h3> Support Engineer, Trello</h3>\n<div>\n Developer\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n UK, Netherlands, Germany, Turkey\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Company: Atlassian\n <br>\n</div>\n<div>\n Full Time\n <br>\n</div>\n<h4>Overview</h4>\n<p>Customer support at Trello is different.</p>\n<p>To start with, we let our customers decide if they want to pay us or not. Seriously. If our customers are not amazingly happy, they get their money back with no questions asked. Our front line staff are empowered to make our customers happy. Usually, it means tapping a broad range of resources, whether that’s making sure you have all the right software, or working directly with an engineer to troubleshoot a case. You’ll have what you need to get the job done.</p>\n<p>You will not be glued to the queue. Sure, we need to get back to customers via email—that will always be there—but support is so much more than grinding through an inbox. This is a real problem-solving job. You’ll have an incredible amount of autonomy in determining how best to contribute your talents and skills to Trello. Think a short video will help customers get started? Make it. Want to write a script to help a customer with the API? Go for it. There’s plenty of room for creativity and technical exploration when it comes to better serving our customers.</p>\n<p>The other side of support is working with the other teams at Trello. All of our teams—engineering, marketing, sales, etc—benefit from support’s role in working directly with customers. It will be your job to figure out how we can serve them as effectively as possible. This is no small task, especially when communication is happening asynchronously across time zones. For example, when working with the engineering team, you need to know when a bug can stay under the radar versus when you should sound the alarm.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Atlassian is a terrific place to work. Great products and a fantastic reputation in business and tech have brought in customers globally, including NASA, Sony, and the United Nations. With offices in Sydney, San Francisco, Austin, Amsterdam, and remote folks all over we are growing really fast and are full of opportunities!</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong></strong>\n<em>The Trello Support Engineer can be located in any of the following countries: Netherlands, UK, Germany, Turkey. This is a fully remote position.</em>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Job summary</strong>\n<p>We don’t want people to just use Trello, we want them to love it. We’re looking to add a person to our support team who is friendly, helpful, and already loves Trello. Your top priority will be to transform our users into super-fans.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>You’ll do this by:</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Troubleshooting and answering their questions via email and social media</li>\n<li>Configuring and troubleshooting SAML-based SSO setups with Trello Enterprise customers, both by email and over the phone when necessary</li>\n<li>Relaying insights from customers on to our product team</li>\n<li>Providing service status updates via our StatusPage and social media</li>\n<li>Crafting documentation and other support materials that empower users to serve themselves</li>\n<p>We use a variety of tools to ensure fluid communication between our customers, support, and the product team. These include email, social media, written documentation, video, internal chat, and Trello itself. Your ability to listen to customers, identify common themes, and communicate clearly will be incredibly valuable to our users and our team.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>More about you</strong>\n<p>We’re believe a great candidate can hit that sweet spot between a technical and a customer facing role. You have a drive to learn new technologies and are responsible for owning customer issues until resolution. You’re a great fit if you have top notch written and verbal communication skills, along with a comfort communicating with customers. You have basic Operation Systems knowledge (Mac and Windows), familiarity with reading console errors, and a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or equivalent demonstrated experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Requirements</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Knowledge of Trello and passion for the product</li>\n<li>Previous experience providing email support as a primary job responsibility. You’ve done full-time professional email-based support before.</li>\n<li>Experience with Enterprise-grade SAML configuration and/or troubleshooting, or equivalent technical experience in that area</li>\n<li>Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li>\n<li>The ability to communicate clearly and positively through written and spoken English</li>\n<li>A broad creative or technical curiosity</li>\n<li>Two-year commitment to working in support at Trello.</li>\n<li>Comfort working independently—in some cases you will be the only team member working, based on timezone. You’ll work within the standard working hours of your timezone.</li>\n<p></p>\n<strong>One or more of the following skills would also contribute to your role on the support team:</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Strong writing skills</li>\n<li>Experience working remotely, or on a heavily-remote team</li>\n<li>Programming experience in any language</li>\n<li>Fluency in languages in addition to English</li>\n<p></p>\n<strong>More about our team</strong>\n<p>We are a different kind of software company: one that listens to client needs, values innovation and solves customer problems with brilliant simplicity. If you start your career with Atlassian, you’ll have a direct impact on millions of users, fast! You won’t get frustrated with bureaucracy or slow decision making, because we encourage innovative thinking. We don’t just want to know your opinions, we want to see your ideas in action. We hire great people and then trust them to be great. Keyword: TRUST.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>More about our benefits</strong>\n<p>Whether you work in an office or a distributed team, Atlassian is highly collaborative and yes, fun! To support you at work (and play) we offer some fantastic perks: ample time off to relax and recharge, flexible working options, five paid volunteer days a year for your favourite cause, an annual allowance to support your learning &amp; growth, unique ShipIt days, a company paid trip after five years and lots more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>More about Atlassian</strong>\n<p>Software is changing the world, and we’re at the center of it all. With a customer list that reads like a who’s who in tech, and a highly disruptive business model, we’re advancing the art of team collaboration with products like Jira Software, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Trello. Driven by honest values, an amazing culture, and consistent revenue growth, we’re out to unleash the potential of every team. From Amsterdam and Austin to Sydney and San Francisco, we’re looking for people who are powered by passion and eager to do the best work of their lives in a highly autonomous yet collaborative, no B.S. environment.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Additional Information</strong>\n<p>We believe that the unique contributions of all Atlassians is the driver of our success. To make sure that our products and culture continue to incorporate everyone’s perspectives and experience we never discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, or marital, veteran, or disability status.</p>\n<p>All your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines.</p>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/atlassian/45b50895-430a-47c2-93d8-066adadef786' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>\n</div>",

As a Customer Support Specialist, you are in the best position to understand how our customers find value, how they use our product, and where they struggle.

That means a huge amount of autonomy and ownership to define your work and impact, and the opportunity to have a major impact.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We also emphasize the journey over the destination. We're looking for applicants that are opinionated about what matters to them, and want to join a fun, passionate, close-knit team of high-quality human beings that above all enjoy working together. Hopefully, that's you!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>Requirements</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  The primary role of this position is to provide customer support coverage during the general timezone of the European Union.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Because we’re a US-based company looking to provide EU support, this particular role has additional logistical considerations.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We prefer when teammates are supporting the timezone that they live in. This means that ideally, you live somewhere in the EU timezone, preferably in the following countries:\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>UK, Spain, Sweden, Ireland</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We intend to fill this position with a contracted worker for any residents outside of the United States.

Our customers interact with our Success team more than any other team in our company.

These members cost health plans millions of medical dollars primarily due to preventable ambulance usage, medical ER visits and medical inpatient admissions. Despite having a BH diagnosis, their BH spending is relatively minor or non-existent.</p>\n <p>Catasys uses a proprietary analytics platform and predictive modeling to identify high utilizers of medical healthcare services with costs that can be significantly reduced by addressing the underlying BH disorder(s). Through proactive outreach, we engage and treat these individuals in our patient-centric program that integrates evidence-based medical interventions, psychosocial skill building and care coaching by nurses.</p>\n <p>The end result is improved health and quality of life for the member, and a 50% reduction in claims costs to the health plan.</p>\n <p>The<strong> Care Coach </strong>is responsible for engagement, enrollment, and coordination of care to improve the health and quality of life for members of the Catasys OnTrak program. Care Coaches utilize existing clinical and functional assessments of client progress, employ targeted intervention and education, and coordinate care pertaining to clients identified issue(s). The Care Coach utilizes Motivational Interviewing techniques to elicit active member participation. In addition, the Care Coach is responsible for the coordination of member care throughout the treatment continuum: medical intervention, relapse prevention, treatment of co-morbid conditions, and issues identified through the individual care plan.</p>\n <ol>\n  <li>Uses exceptional written and verbal communication skills to engage, enroll, and maintain members in active participation in the OnTrak program as well as to coordinate member care.</li>\n  <li>Conducts superior motivational interviewing, enhancement, and relapse prevention guidelines in telephonic communication with clients.</li>\n  <li>Demonstrates superior knowledge of the Catasys OnTrak treatment program and usage of the eOnTrak electronic documentation platform.</li>\n  <li>Provides exemplary customer service to and member-centric focus for, all clients.</li>\n  <li>Communicates or requests information from providers in complete compliance with confidentiality standards and in a manner that generates cooperation.</li>\n  <li>Complies with Catasys policies and procedures, including training, audits, alert response timeliness, intervention and follow-through, supervision receptiveness, as well as other Catasys policies and procedures related to the provision of services.</li>\n  <li>Complies with Catasys Human Resource policies and procedures.</li>\n  <li>Supports and meets any Catasys accreditation, auditing, contracted stakeholder reporting expectation.</li>\n  <li>Works jointly with the Clinical Care Coordinator to support member referral, engagement, and enrollment into the OnTrak program.</li>\n  <li>Supports enhancement of the eOnTrak electronic documentation platform by providing feedback to the development team and performing ad hoc system testing as indicated.</li>\n </ol>\n <p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Qualified candidate will be a licensed RN/LPN/LVN with a strong interest in behavioral health. </strong>A minimum of three years of direct clinical experience in an acute care setting is required, a background in psych or chemical dependency is a bonus.

While you don't need to be a full-stack developer to fill this role, you will be providing hosting support to full-stack developers, so you do need to be familiar with the full-stack, from Linux web servers to browser dev tools.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <strong>Bonus points:</strong>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Completely fluent in a second language.

MyTutor’s mission is to bring life-changing tuition to all. Our handpicked network of tutors work online with pupils from all walks of life, and we’ve given over a quarter of a million lessons so far – raising results on average by one whole grade. We’re proud of the fact that over 300 schools have also chosen to work with us. And that we’ve earned a Trustpilot rating of 9.4/10.\n<br>\n<br>We understand the hectic lives of families with teenagers, and our flexible lesson times mean parents can juggle schedules more easily. On our website, it’s simple to find a tutor your child gets on with – and every lesson is tailored to their needs. Also, by having lessons via live video, pupils can access the best tutors no matter where they live or when they need help. No travelling for Mum and Dad, no waiting around, no strangers in your home. Pupils can have their lessons anywhere – at Grandma’s, at a friend’s house or on holiday, so there’s no disruption in the run-up to exams.\n<br>\n<br>Tuition is now more affordable and accessible, making life less stressful for busy parents doing their best.\n<br>\n<br>*About the role*\n<br>\n<br>You’ll be joining our passionate, ambitious team in an exciting, fast-paced &amp; high-growth environment.

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Many of these restaurant chains hire software development teams to create a wide variety of custom applications and websites that integrate with Olo’s APIs. Likewise, the emergence of third party restaurant marketplaces and delivery services has opened new sales channels for restaurant chains, and Olo enables those channels via integrations to our APIs. We also work with a broad array of food delivery providers, POS vendors, and loyalty platform providers who integrate their solutions into the Olo Platform to enable a complete digital ordering experience. Working on Olo’s Developer Support team will give you the opportunity to assist developers from the most innovative and notable tech companies in the food space. \n  <br> \n  <br>Olo is transforming the digital ordering landscape for restaurant chains in an ever-evolving ecosystem, and we're looking for a talented engineer and support specialist to join our team in the role of a Developer Support Engineer to help us achieve our vision. You will play a significant and visible role in helping our partners incorporate online ordering into their own applications and solutions. Your primary role will be to provide developer-level support for developers who are integrating to our APIs. You will also be responsible for improving our Developer Portal (where integration partners manage their API projects), API documentation, and associated tools needed to provide an exceptional integration experience. Your success will enable the expansion of the Olo digital ordering universe. \n  <br> \n  <br>You'll work with a smart, friendly, and passionate team dedicated to delivering amazing products using modern tools and technologies such as .NET 4.6, ASP.NET MVC 5, TeamCity, GitHub, Octopus Deploy and heavy use of OSS. \n  <br> \n  <br>This is a full-time position. Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, by far the majority of our engineering team is remote! \n  <br> \n  <br>Responsibilities \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* You will serve as a technical interface to our development partners, supporting their ability to incorporate Olo services into their applications and solutions via our APIs. Specifically, you will answer daily technical questions from a wide variety of integration partners related to the functional behavior of our APIs, and you will investigate and resolve problems they report with their integration. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You will evolve our Developer Portal to provide a complete technical repository of information, documentation, and tools that our partners will use to incorporate Olo online ordering into their products. \n  <br> \n  <br>* This is a unique role that requires a special combination of responsibilities: daily developer support, great documentation writing, and the ability to both interpret and write quality software. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Requirements \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* A passion for computing that extends beyond work \n  <br> \n  <br>* Excellent English writing and communication skills \n  <br> \n  <br>* Enjoys the daily variability of a developer support role and the need to sometimes jump in and help untangle ambiguous problems \n  <br> \n  <br>* At least 3 years on-the-job software development experience \n  <br> \n  <br>* Excellent knowledge of C#, .NET and object oriented concepts \n  <br> \n  <br>* Comfortable in multiple programming languages and frameworks \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience developing or integrating to a RESTful API \n  <br> \n  <br>* Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git) \n  <br> \n  <br>* A good working knowledge of ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS \n  <br> \n  <br>* BS in Computer Science or related field, or comparable industry experience \n  <br> \n  <br>* Legal right to work in the U.S. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Beneficial \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience in a technical support or developer support role \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience with technical writing in a software environment \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience working in Zendesk \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

In this&nbsp;, board member Stephen Colbert tells the organization’s story.</p>\n<a href='http://www.donorschoose.org' rel='nofollow'></a>\n<strong>DonorsChoose.org</strong>\n<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=gxWPM2LMJ6I' rel='nofollow'>clip</a>\n<p>Since our launch in 2000, more than 3 million “citizen philanthropists” have donated to classroom projects on DonorsChoose.org, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 28 million students in public schools, overwhelmingly from low-income households. Along the way, the organization helped to pioneer the field of crowdfunding and is now making an impact&nbsp;beyond school supplies.</p>\n<p>Through its&nbsp;dedicated team&nbsp;and culture, DonorsChoose.org earned recognition as the #1 “Best Nonprofit to Work For” by the </p>\n<em>Nonprofit Times.</em>\n<p></p>\n<strong>About the Customer Support team:</strong>\n<p>As a branch of the Operations team at DonorsChoose.org, Customer Support is responsible for all one-to-one touchpoints — reactive and proactive — and self-service tools that help teachers, donors, administrators, or any member of the general public successfully use our website.</p>\n<p>As a small and mighty remote team, autonomy and ownership are of the highest value. The quality of our support is a shared responsibility across the team and we all bring ideas to the table to improve our work. We appreciate and take advantage of the time we have to get in sync — one weekly team touchpoint, monthly check-ins with managers, and a vibrant Slack community — but we also deeply value and prioritize our ability to focus on solving customer inquiries.</p>\n<p>Finally, we are passionate about serving our customer base — we get to help people bring classroom projects to life and enrich learning experiences! — and believe in support that is kind, personalized, and simple. We go the extra mile when we need to, give people the benefit of the doubt, and take pride in providing engaged and complete support. We get that providing exceptional support to teachers and donors adds value to the DonorsChoose.org mission. We are pretty darn awesome!</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>About the role:</strong>\n<p>As a Customer Support Specialist at DonorsChoose.org, you’ll answer between 50 – 120 emails a day (depending on the day). These inquiries will span a variety of different topics across the entire teacher and donor lifecycles.</p>\n<p>You may help a donor navigate our marketplace to support a school in their hometown. Or you may help a teacher get donations multiplied by qualifying for a partner-backed offer. You may walk a mother through surprising her daughter (a first-year teacher!) by fully funding her classroom project. Or you may spend some time tracking down a shipment of live crickets (yikes!) for a sixth-grade science class. And sometimes you’ll have to do things like explain policies that won’t make the customer super happy, deliver difficult news about eligibility, or simply help a customer reset a password. It’s not all glamor and live insects, but at the end of every day, you’ll have helped a bunch of people bring joy to a bunch of students!</p>\n<p>In addition to this core work, sometimes you’ll —</p>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Hop on the phone to resolve particularly gnarly issues. (We work primarily in email right now, but sometimes it’s just easier to get on the phone and hash it out!)</li>\n<li>Attend and participate in trainings as scheduled by your team leaders.</li>\n<li>Provide feedback to your peers on their tickets and coach newer teammates.</li>\n<li>Build documentation to support our work.</li>\n<li>Write up bug reports for our Product and Engineering team.</li>\n<li>Update or write public-facing help content.</li>\n<li>Answer support questions for colleagues across the organization.</li>\n<li>Lead mini-projects or fact-finding missions — and present ideas or findings to teammates, managers, or others across the organization.</li>\n<p></p>\n<strong>As a successful Customer Support Specialist, you are:</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>You are the face of DonorsChoose.org to many of its customers. As such, you hold yourself to a high standard. You are task-driven, attentive, collaborative, and accountable. Particularly as a remote professional, you can work autonomously and don’t require a ton of supervision.</li>\n<strong>Professional.&nbsp;</strong>\n<li>It is your job to be clear and concise, to gain agreement on issues, to match tone and be understood by customers who have varied technical experiences and diverse backgrounds. You are a great writer and are not afraid of the phone.</li>\n<strong>A solid communicator.&nbsp;</strong>\n<li>&nbsp;You take pride in your work and care about outcomes.

    "content": "<p><a href='http://www.donorschoose.org/' rel='nofollow'>DonorsChoose.org</a>&nbsp;makes it easy for anyone to help a classroom in need, moving us closer to a nation where students in every community have the tools and experiences they need for a great education. In this&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=gxWPM2LMJ6I' rel='nofollow'>clip</a>, board member Stephen Colbert tells the organization’s story.</p>\n<p>Since our launch in 2000, more than 3 million “citizen philanthropists” have donated to classroom projects on DonorsChoose.org, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 28 million students in public schools, overwhelmingly from low-income households. Along the way, the organization helped to pioneer the field of crowdfunding and is now making an impact&nbsp;beyond school supplies.</p>\n<p>Through its&nbsp;dedicated team&nbsp;and culture, DonorsChoose.org earned recognition as the #1 “Best Nonprofit to Work For” by the&nbsp;<em>Nonprofit Times.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the Customer Support Team:</strong></p>\n<p>As a branch of the Operations team at DonorsChoose.org, Customer Support is responsible for all one-to-one touchpoints — reactive and proactive — and self-service tools that help teachers, donors, administrators, or any member of the general public successfully use our website.</p>\n<p>As a small and mighty remote team, autonomy and ownership are of the highest value. The quality of our support is a shared responsibility across the team and we all bring ideas to the table to improve our work. We appreciate and take advantage of the time we have to get in sync — one weekly team touchpoint, monthly check-ins with managers, and a vibrant Slack community — but we also deeply value and prioritize our ability to focus on solving customer inquiries.</p>\n<p>Finally, we are passionate about serving our customer base — we get to help people bring classroom projects to life and enrich learning experiences! — and believe in support that is kind, personalized, and simple. We go the extra mile when we need to, give people the benefit of the doubt, and take pride in providing engaged and complete support. We get that providing exceptional support to teachers and donors adds value to the DonorsChoose.org mission. We are pretty darn awesome!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About the role:</strong></p>\n<p>As a Customer Support Specialist at DonorsChoose.org, you’ll answer between 50 – 120 emails a day (depending on the day). These inquiries will span a variety of different topics across the entire teacher and donor lifecycles.</p>\n<p>You may help a donor navigate our marketplace to support a school in their hometown. Or you may help a teacher get donations multiplied by qualifying for a partner-backed offer. You may walk a mother through surprising her daughter (a first-year teacher!) by fully funding her classroom project. Or you may spend some time tracking down a shipment of live crickets (yikes!) for a sixth-grade science class. And sometimes you’ll have to do things like explain policies that won’t make the customer super happy, deliver difficult news about eligibility, or simply help a customer reset a password. It’s not all glamor and live insects, but at the end of every day, you’ll have helped a bunch of people bring joy to a bunch of students!</p>\n<p>In addition to this core work, sometimes you’ll —</p>\n<p>Hop on the phone to resolve particularly gnarly issues. (We work primarily in email right now, but sometimes it’s just easier to get on the phone and hash it out!)</p>\n<p>Attend and participate in trainings as scheduled by your team leaders.</p>\n<p>Provide feedback to your peers on their tickets and coach newer teammates.</p>\n<p>Build documentation to support our work.</p>\n<p>Write up bug reports for our Product and Engineering team.</p>\n<p>Update or write public-facing help content.</p>\n<p>Answer support questions for colleagues across the organization.</p>\n<p>Lead mini-projects or fact-finding missions — and present ideas or findings to teammates, managers, or others across the organization.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a successful Customer Support Specialist, you are:</p>\n<p><strong>Professional.</strong>&nbsp;You are the face of DonorsChoose.org to many of its customers. As such, you hold yourself to a high standard. You are task-driven, attentive, collaborative, and accountable. Particularly as a remote professional, you can work autonomously and don’t require a ton of supervision.</p>\n<p><strong>A solid communicator.</strong>&nbsp;It is your job to be clear and concise, to gain agreement on issues, to match tone and be understood by customers who have varied technical experiences and diverse backgrounds. You are a great writer and are not afraid of the phone.</p>\n<p><strong>Thoughtful.</strong>&nbsp;You take pride in your work and care about outcomes. You think “What if I were in this position? What would I want to hear right now?”&nbsp;You foster positive experiences even when it means saying no or sharing difficult or highly-technical information.</p>\n<p><strong>Tech comfy.</strong>&nbsp;You’ll use Zendesk (a ticket management platform), the DonorsChoose.org administrative site, and other third-party applications (Slack, GSuite, and more) in your daily work. You are supporting the use of a two-sided marketplace and want to learn the ins and outs of how it all works. You know basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>\n<p><strong>A learner.</strong>&nbsp;You recognize that you are always in a position to learn and that you can learn from anyone at any time, including customers.

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Many of these restaurant chains hire software development teams to create a wide variety of custom applications and websites that integrate with Olo’s APIs. Likewise, the emergence of third party restaurant marketplaces and delivery services has opened new sales channels for restaurant chains, and Olo enables those channels via integrations to our APIs. We also work with a broad array of food delivery providers, POS vendors, and loyalty platform providers who integrate their solutions into the Olo Platform to enable a complete digital ordering experience. Working on Olo’s Developer Support team will give you the opportunity to assist developers from the most innovative and notable tech companies in the food space.</p>\n <p>Olo is transforming the digital ordering landscape for restaurant chains in an ever-evolving ecosystem, and we're looking for a talented engineer and support specialist to join our team in the role of a Developer Support Engineer to help us achieve our vision. You will play a significant and visible role in helping our partners incorporate online ordering into their own applications and solutions. Your primary role will be to provide developer-level support for developers who are integrating to our APIs. You will also be responsible for improving our Developer Portal (where integration partners manage their API projects), API documentation, and associated tools needed to provide an exceptional integration experience. Your success will enable the expansion of the Olo digital ordering universe.</p>\n <p>You'll work with a smart, friendly, and passionate team dedicated to delivering amazing products using modern tools and technologies such as .NET 4.6, ASP.NET MVC 5, TeamCity, GitHub, Octopus Deploy and heavy use of OSS.</p>\n <p>This is a full-time position. Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, by far the majority of our engineering team is remote!</p>\n <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You will serve as a technical interface to our development partners, supporting their ability to incorporate Olo services into their applications and solutions via our APIs. Specifically, you will answer daily technical questions from a wide variety of integration partners related to the functional behavior of our APIs, and you will investigate and resolve problems they report with their integration.</li>\n  <li>You will evolve our Developer Portal to provide a complete technical repository of information, documentation, and tools that our partners will use to incorporate Olo online ordering into their products.</li>\n  <li>This is a unique role that requires a special combination of responsibilities: daily developer support, great documentation writing, and the ability to both interpret and write quality software.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>A passion for computing that extends beyond work</li>\n  <li>Excellent English writing and communication skills</li>\n  <li>Enjoys the daily variability of a developer support role and the need to sometimes jump in and help untangle ambiguous problems</li>\n  <li>At least 3 years on-the-job software development experience</li>\n  <li>Excellent knowledge of C#, .NET and object oriented concepts</li>\n  <li>Comfortable in multiple programming languages and frameworks</li>\n  <li>Experience developing or integrating to a RESTful API</li>\n  <li>Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)</li>\n  <li>A good working knowledge of ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS</li>\n  <li>BS in Computer Science or related field, or comparable industry experience</li>\n  <li>Legal right to work in the U.S.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Beneficial</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience in a technical support or developer support role</li>\n  <li>Experience with technical writing in a software environment</li>\n  <li>Experience working in Zendesk</li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://olo.applytojob.com/apply/EDPuNk6Gje/Developer-Support-Engineer?source=stackoverflow' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>About Olo</h4> \n<div>\n <p>Olo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 200 restaurant brands.

In this&nbsp;</span><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=gxWPM2LMJ6I' rel='nofollow'>clip</a><span>, board member Stephen Colbert tells the organization’s story.</span></h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Since our launch in 2000, more than 3 million “citizen philanthropists” have donated to classroom projects on DonorsChoose.org, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 28 million students in public schools, overwhelmingly from low-income households. Along the way, the organization helped to pioneer the field of crowdfunding and is now making an impact&nbsp;beyond school supplies.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Through its&nbsp;dedicated team&nbsp;and culture, DonorsChoose.org earned recognition as the #1 “Best Nonprofit to Work For” by the&nbsp;\n  <em>Nonprofit Times.</em>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <em><br></em>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <b>About the Customer Support Team:</b>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  As a branch of the Operations team at DonorsChoose.org, Customer Support is responsible for all one-to-one touchpoints — reactive and proactive — and self-service tools that help teachers, donors, administrators, or any member of the general public successfully use our website.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  As a small and mighty remote team, autonomy and ownership are of the highest value. The quality of our support is a shared responsibility across the team and we all bring ideas to the table to improve our work. We appreciate and take advantage of the time we have to get in sync — one weekly team touchpoint, monthly check-ins with managers, and a vibrant Slack community — but we also deeply value and prioritize our ability to focus on solving customer inquiries.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Finally, we are passionate about serving our customer base — we get to help people bring classroom projects to life and enrich learning experiences! — and believe in support that is kind, personalized, and simple. We go the extra mile when we need to, give people the benefit of the doubt, and take pride in providing engaged and complete support. We get that providing exceptional support to teachers and donors adds value to the DonorsChoose.org mission. We are pretty darn awesome!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span><b>About the role:</b></span>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  As a Customer Support Specialist at DonorsChoose.org, you’ll answer between 50 – 120 emails a day (depending on the day). These inquiries will span a variety of different topics across the entire teacher and donor lifecycles.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You may help a donor navigate our marketplace to support a school in their hometown. Or you may help a teacher get donations multiplied by qualifying for a partner-backed offer. You may walk a mother through surprising her daughter (a first-year teacher!) by fully funding her classroom project. Or you may spend some time tracking down a shipment of live crickets (yikes!) for a sixth-grade science class. And sometimes you’ll have to do things like explain policies that won’t make the customer super happy, deliver difficult news about eligibility, or simply help a customer reset a password. It’s not all glamor and live insects, but at the end of every day, you’ll have helped a bunch of people bring joy to a bunch of students!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  In addition to this core work, sometimes you’ll —\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Hop on the phone to resolve particularly gnarly issues. (We work primarily in email right now, but sometimes it’s just easier to get on the phone and hash it out!)\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  Attend and participate in trainings as scheduled by your team leaders.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  Provide feedback to your peers on their tickets and coach newer teammates.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  Build documentation to support our work.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  Write up bug reports for our Product and Engineering team.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  Update or write public-facing help content.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  Answer support questions for colleagues across the organization.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  Lead mini-projects or fact-finding missions — and present ideas or findings to teammates, managers, or others across the organization.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>As a successful Customer Support Specialist, you are:</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <b>Professional.</b>&nbsp;You are the face of DonorsChoose.org to many of its customers. As such, you hold yourself to a high standard. You are task-driven, attentive, collaborative, and accountable. Particularly as a remote professional, you can work autonomously and don’t require a ton of supervision.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <b>A solid communicator.</b>&nbsp;It is your job to be clear and concise, to gain agreement on issues, to match tone and be understood by customers who have varied technical experiences and diverse backgrounds. You are a great writer and are not afraid of the phone.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <span><b>Thoughtful.</b></span>&nbsp;You take pride in your work and care about outcomes. You think “What if I were in this position? What would I want to hear right now?”&nbsp;You foster positive experiences even when it means saying no or sharing difficult or highly-technical information.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <span><b>Tech comfy.</b></span>&nbsp;You’ll use Zendesk (a ticket management platform), the DonorsChoose.org administrative site, and other third-party applications (Slack, GSuite, and more) in your daily work. You are supporting the use of a two-sided marketplace and want to learn the ins and outs of how it all works. You know basic troubleshooting techniques.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <span><b>A learner.</b></span>&nbsp;You recognize that you are always in a position to learn and that you can learn from anyone at any time, including customers. This makes you flexible to change and open to feedback on your work.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <span><b>Decisive.</b></span>&nbsp;You’ll make judgment calls and decisions based on your knowledge of our policies and processes. You have a bias toward action. You recognize you might make mistakes or occasionally say the wrong thing to a customer, but are confident in your ability to own mistakes and learn from them.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <span><b>Resourceful.</b></span>&nbsp;Not every question has an easy answer, but you’re totally into figuring things out.

By doing this, L&amp;D can help everybody be better at their jobs and take on exciting new roles.\n<br>\n<br>Our customers are not just companies who pay us in exchange for tech. We build deep relationships with the brilliant people at ASOS, Amazon, Sky, Financial Times, and more, and they rely on us for thought-leading, practical support to get better results through their Learning &amp; Development.\n<br>\n<br>As people, we are experts at what we do, driven to make a difference, and friends who like working with each other.

As a Client Success Strategist, you’ll help Crush My Market and our clients succeed through the following:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>Build &amp; maintain amazing client relationships</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Become the day-to-day contact for our clients and their staff<br></li>\n  <li>Proactively reach out to clients to make sure we are meeting expectations<br></li>\n  <li>Be able to answer client questions or track down answers when you are unable to answer yourself<br></li>\n  <li>Build rapport with our clients and their staff<br></li>\n  <li>Make sure clients are doing what they need to do<br></li>\n  <li>Improve our client communication processes like onboarding, goal setting, etc.<br><br></li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <h5>Help implement our growth strategies</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Serve as a project manager keeping our project management system up-to-date and most importantly making sure we are meeting our expectations in terms of client deliverables<br></li>\n  <li>Manage members of our outsourcing team making sure they provide high-quality deliverables on time and within budget<br></li>\n  <li>Hold yourself and others accountable for keeping our promises<br></li>\n  <li>Assist with creating certain deliverables as needed (in other words, if we need something done and you can do it, please do it)<br></li>\n  <li>Become an expert in using various tools like HubSpot, Google Analytics, Google Data Studio, dashboards, etc.<br></li>\n  <li>Stay informed about the latest growth strategies, as well as relevant information that applies to our clients and their industries<br></li>\n  <li>Contribute content like blog posts, YouTube videos, social media posts, etc.<br></li>\n  <li>Participate in client meetings<br><br></li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <h5>Demonstrate the ROI of working with us</h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Create performance reports while identifying wins, areas to improve, and recommendations<br></li>\n  <li>Setup and maintain custom dashboards showing agreed upon metrics and KPIs<br></li>\n  <li>Alert the appropriate people when we are not making sufficient progress towards stated goals<br></li>\n  <li>Send clients regular communications showing the progress we are making and the results we are achieving<br><br></li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  Additionally, as a small agency everybody is expected to pitch in and help where needed. So in addition to your direct responsibilities as a Client Success Strategist, you’ll likely be asked to help in other areas from time to time. Just like we ask everyone else on our team.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4>Remote Position</h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  This is a remote position. You need to make sure you are capable of working in a remote environment while being a highly productive and contributing member of the team.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We’ll be able to stay connected with regular meetings via web conference. And we’ll all get together in person a couple times a year to build our relationships. But working remotely takes a lot of discipline. So make sure you’re up for the challenge!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We are fairly flexible in terms of work hours. Our clients are exclusively in the United States and Canada. We expect you to work during normal business hours - so that means most of your work time is somewhere between 8AM Eastern and 5PM Pacific.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Need to run an errand?

Depending upon client meetings, we’re flexible in that respect.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h4>Compensation &amp; Benefits</h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Competitive Salary</li>\n  <li>Health &amp; Dental Insurance</li>\n  <li>Paid Time Off Policy<br></li>\n  <li>Work Remotely<br></li>\n  <li>Flexible Work Schedule<br></li>\n  <li>Culture Of Learning, Training, &amp; Professional Development<br><br></li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <h4>Job Requirements</h4>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You might be a good fit if . . .\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>You have amazing relationship skills</li>\n  <li>You are highly organized and enjoy managing multiple projects at once</li>\n  <li>You hate missing deadlines and not fulfilling promises</li>\n  <li>You have strong communication skills - both orally and in writing</li>\n  <li>You're a good listener who's naturally interesting in hearing about problems and searching for solutions</li>\n  <li>You feel comfortable managing a team of outsourcers</li>\n  <li>You have the confidence to speak out when something is not right</li>\n  <li>You're patient, warm, and organized.</li>\n  <li>You have previous experience in a customer success role or in managing client relationships</li>\n  <li>You aren't afraid of taking on new tasks and getting things done</li>\n  <li>You're willing to learn and create new processes</li>\n  <li>You enjoy marketing and are willing to roll up your sleeves and pitch in to get things done</li>\n  <li>You have experience working remotely and managing your own schedule</li>\n  <li>You have aspirations of taking on more and more responsibility</li>\n  <li>You aren't afraid of data and actually enjoy looking at numbers and graphs</li>\n  <li>You are based in the US and can work primarily between 8AM Eastern - 5PM Pacific</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <span><br></span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Bonus points for the following . . .\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>You have experience with popular project management systems like Asana, ClickUp, Teamwork, Basecamp, etc.</li>\n  <li>You have experience using a CRM like HubSpot or Salesforce</li>\n  <li>You have experience working in WordPress websites</li>\n  <li>You have experience in sales, marketing, or customer support</li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n<div>\n <h4> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more Sales &amp; Marketing jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h4>\n <ul>\n  <li><span>New</span>\n   <div></div>\n   <div>\n    <a rel='nofollow'>\n     <div></div><span>View company profile</span></a>\n   </div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Hotjar</span><br><span>Marketing Analyst (EMEA)</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>EMEA</span></a></li>\n  <li><span>New</span>\n   <div></div>\n   <div>\n    <a rel='nofollow'>\n     <div></div><span>View company profile</span></a>\n   </div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Hubbard Digital Pty.

The work may be tedious with dating profile reviews and often answering similar support questions. At times you will lose faith in humanity and wonder how the asker gets by each day. If you need your social life packaged in a meal-deal with your work, prepare to be underwhelmed.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  If you’re still reading, this might be your dream job. Our dating site users are in need of your TLC. You will send support emails that help them succeed in finding matches, and ensure they don’t have a Kardashian as their profile pic. Repetitive clichés will amuse you. The photos that make you wish iPhones never had cameras will morbidly fascinate, rather than offend.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  If customer service is your passion, perfect! More likely it’s not, but this job will free you to follow it.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You’ll be working up to 40 hours a week with flexibility - our customer support team aims to respond to queries in the shortest time possible between 6am and 8pm EST Monday to Sunday so some weekend work is also involved, but we share the case load so that you don’t step away from the computer wanting to run into the woods never to be seen again.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Put in the work without someone having to prod you, and you can have a great time. Prove yourself and join the ranks of our core team that has been together for years. Our small team is distributed globally. We get shit done but don’t take ourselves too seriously. We are not a startup and measure success by the apparently-unsexy metric of making more money than we spend. We don’t use words like ‘disrupt’, and implemented our ‘exit strategy’ when we escaped the confines of the 9-5 tedium and commute.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  If you were mildly entertained, or want a job, we would love to hear from you!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  *Candidates from the following countries are invited to apply for this position: UK, Ireland, South Africa, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands.*\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Submit your best proof of being able to do this work: supportjob@secretbenefits.com&nbsp;\n </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n <h4> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more Customer Support jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h4>\n <ul>\n  <li><span>New</span>\n   <div></div>\n   <div>\n    <a rel='nofollow'>\n     <div></div><span>View company profile</span></a>\n   </div><a rel='nofollow'><span>AgencyAnalytics</span><br><span>Customer Success Specialist</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>North America Only</span></a></li>\n  <li>\n   <div></div>\n   <div>\n    <a rel='nofollow'>\n     <div></div><span>View company profile</span></a>\n   </div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Pixellu</span><br><span>Customer Support Rep (Remote &amp; Flexible)</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>Pacific Time</span></a></li>\n </ul>\n <br>\n</div>",
