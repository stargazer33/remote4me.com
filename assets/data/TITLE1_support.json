Education stipend. Will purchase a computer for you.</p><p></p><p>This is a 100% Remote position.</p><p>We may have an annual meeting in LA, Seattle, or somewhere else- which we will fly you in for.</p><p>Working on Eastern Standard Time is preferred.</p><p>We have a 1-hour weekly meeting and that’s it. The rest is just ad hoc communications as needed. We work collaboratively to make sure customers succeed and are happy.</p><p>Here’s the good news. You will be busy 7 months of the year and not busy 5 months of the year. We can either shift your work to marketing related activities in the down time, or you can simply take that time off (unpaid vacation) while maintaining your benefits.</p><p>Peak work months are December through April, September and October. That means you could be free to roam the world or tend your garden for May, June, July, August, and November.</p><p>We all have lives outside of work. We like trading jokes and chatting during the day while we work. Topics include travel, sports, pop culture, and lots of memes.</p><h5><strong>What you will Do</strong></h5><p><strong>Core Activities #1: Help Customers Succeed.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Taxes and cryptocurrency can be complicated. ­­­­Our customers will need help navigating our application, 3rd party applications like cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, and then some help understanding accounting and tax issues. Customers will need help creating simple spreadsheets or making adjustments to their account. We offer support by phone, email, and chat. We reply during evenings and weekends. We are very polite to our customers, who are often stressed. However, we don’t let them walk all over us. We are professionals and we expect to be treated as such.</p><p></p><p>We view Customer Success as a key part of how we grow our business. Many customers refer their friends and accountants. We form business partnerships based on the strength of our customer service too. So, during peak tax seasons, it’s all hands on deck as we deal with hundreds of customers during a very stressful time for them. So, you will see the executive team and senior developers helping basically on a 24/7 cycle in late December, March, April, and October.</p><p></p><p>This position will require quick, efficient communication. You’ll have to learn and understand how our software works, how cryptocurrency works, how taxes and accounting works, and how people work. You’ll have to listen carefully and solve problems. Sometimes you’ll have to apologize or ask for forgiveness. Often, you’ll get effusive praise from happy customers and they’ll offer to tip you or take you out for drinks. You’ll have to learn a lot of new things and problem solve. Be prepared to talk about your experience doing this on a regular basis.</p><p></p><p><strong>Core Activity #2: Product Development</strong></p><p>We are constantly trying to learn. So, you will be taking customer feedback so we can make everyone’s lives easier. You can also update our instructional materials to help customers and reduce your own workload</p><p></p><p>A background in accounting, tax, or fintech saas tech support is great. If you want to learn something new by attending a conference, buy a book, or purchasing an online course- we’ll pay for that.</p><p></p><p><strong>Core Activity #3: Marketing</strong></p><p>If you chose to work the full year and help with marketing, we have a number of activities around writing articles, copywriting, social media, and video production.</p><h5><strong>In this role you will:</strong></h5><p>-Develop deep knowledge of the ZenLedger software and Crypto Tax treatments and standards</p><p>-Partner with our customers to effectively assess and resolve issues through chat, email and phone support</p><p>-Answer “how to” questions and help customers navigate a variety of features in ZenLedger</p><p>-Diagnose and report software issues along with UI/UX and customer navigation issues and engage with our product and engineering teams using established processes to ensure customer success</p><p>-Communicate thoughtful, customized solutions that help customers quickly and accurately report and file their Crypto Taxes</p><p>-Show composure, resilience, and flexibility as customer needs evolve and case volume fluctuates</p><p>-Work is performed under limited supervision with considerable latitude for the use of initiative and independent problem solving</p><h5><strong>We are looking for people who:</strong></h5><p>-Find creative problem solving fulfilling and challenging</p><p>-Are self motivated and eager to learn</p><p>-Thrive in a dynamic and collaborative environment and are self starters</p><p>-Adapt quickly and respectfully to changing priorities and customer needs</p><p>-Have a clear, professional, and informative communication style</p><h5><strong>Who You Will Work With:</strong></h5><p>Pat Larsen, CEO. US Air Force Academy grad, Chicago Booth MBA. Experience in M&amp;A investment banking, Amazon, and startups.</p><p>Bryan Starbuck, CTO. UCSD comp sci grad.&nbsp; Bryan worked for 10 years at Microsoft. He has since worked on his own startups as the CEO/CTO with 3 exits, including TalentSpring and Assurance (2019, $2.3B).</p><p>Dan Hannum, Director Business Development. Univ South Carolina, MBA. Dan was a Venture Capital analyst and worked in TD Ameritrade’s Ultra High Net Worth client practice. He has been a crypto investor since 2013.</p><h5><strong>Customer Testimonials</strong></h5><p>We hold ourselves to a very high standard when working with customers to earn their trust.</p><p>Here are some of my favorite testimonials:</p><p>“I re-stated my taxes from 2013 using ZenLedger and found $235,000 in overpayment to the</p><p>IRS”</p><p></p><p>“I refiled my 2017 crypto trades for the second time with the IRS and got an email from the IRS</p><p>criminal investigation division informing me that they had a case open on me but were now</p><p>going to close it. Dodged a bullet there. Glad I used your software.”</p><p></p><p>“I had no idea how complicated tax reporting for cryptocurrencies would be. You have a</p><p>customer for life.”</p><p></p><p>“Not only have I told my friends, but my CPA loves the software!”</p><p></p><p>“Most of the others in our 14-member investment group are techies and we all use ZL. Myself</p><p>and my dad, are the weak link. Your team and product saved us. Toast to you.”</p><p></p><p>“Again, thanks for your product. If you ever make it to the Bay area, hit me up. I have two</p><p>kegerators on the back deck overlooking the estuary. I owe you at least a good German beer.”</p><p></p><p><strong>Location</strong>: US or Canada</p>        </div><div>        <a href='mailto:hello@zenledger.io?subject=Application%20via%20Customer%20Success%20Specialist%20listing%20on%20https%3A%2F%2Fremote.co' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

    "content": "<h3> Customer Support Representative </h3><div><div>Help us make work a better place! We provide 750 companies worldwide with a feedback platform so their employees can learn from each other and grow professionally. SoundCloud, Zapier, Strava, Duolingo and many more use our SAAS solution company-wide — from the intern to the CEO.<br><br></div><div>We're looking for a friendly and proactive customer support representative who is keen to work full-time remotely. You’ll cover the US eastern time zones, thus linking our Berlin-based development HQ and our <span>US based Customer team</span>. You’ll answer tough questions from our clients’ administrators, provide feedback on customer experience to the development team, and help us make our clients successful.<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>Who we are</strong></h3><div>We’re a <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/' rel='nofollow'>company of 35 people in Berlin and the US</a>. Our product is a performance feedback platform rolled out company-wide from the intern to the CEO. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives, organize one-on-one meetings, and to praise each other for a job well done.<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>What you'll do</strong></h3><div>The customer support role is mainly about helping clients when they run into questions or bugs with the product, but there are also aspects of customer success, sales, marketing and account management. It’s a perfect fit for a well-rounded person that likes workplace flexibility and variety.</div><div><br>To provide support coverage, you’ll need to be located in the CST or EST time zones.<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Key tasks will be:</strong></div><ul><li>Timely responses to the online support tickets filed by our clients. We respond to all customers within 24 hours, with a typical response time within 1 hour from when the customer emails.</li><li>We primarily use email, but we jump on the phone and host screen sharing sessions on demand. Talking with our customers on the phone is a core part of this role. It won't be daily, but you'll be asked to provide coverage for customer success and sales by helping customers and prospects with tool functionality over the phone. You'll be trained on demonstrating the product as we also sometimes represent our company at industry conferences.</li><li>Working very closely with our sales, marketing and customer success team to develop key accounts and help customers succeed long term. As an example this could include working on cross-team projects like marketing promotions or webinars.</li><li>Collecting product feedback, as well as engaging in feature discussions. It’s important to us to improve the product based on the common questions we get from clients, and support is core to this mission.</li><li>Updating our customer facing documentation. Support’s ownership of our help guides is key to helping customers learn our tool, and you’ll work closely with marketing on those efforts.</li><li>Troubleshooting bugs and working closely with developers to manage a reported bug from start to finish. You use system logs, test and replicate reported bugs in your test environment, as well as work closely with engineers to update or troubleshoot with customers and track system issues on Github.</li></ul><div><br></div><h3><strong>Who we're looking for</strong></h3><div><strong>1+ years of experience supporting B2B SaaS software:</strong> our product is a web-based SaaS solution, so experience in customer support with comparable online products is a must.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Familiar with online support tool sets:</strong> you should be familiar with online support software like Helpscout, CRMs like Hubspot, and tools like Trello or Github.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>You write well:</strong> most communication does happen in writing, so it’s important that you get your message across with clarity and ease to a diverse international audience. We also rely on Slack to communicate across the organization, so an ability to communicate effectively over text is essential.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>You aren’t afraid to jump on the phone:</strong> although we primarily use email, you should also be comfortable helping customers over the phone while delivering a professional and engaging phone presence for our customers.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Experience with remote work:</strong> there are many advantages to working from home: no commute, flexible location. Our satellite workers are of the self-driven, comfortably autonomous variety though. So if you are naturally a self-starter with excellent time management skills, work with a low level of direction, and remain very proactive about keeping everyone in the loop - you'll fit right in.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Technical plus charming:</strong> you need to be tech-savvy and a fast learner, as our product is complex and contains some very technical aspects. It’s not uncommon to troubleshoot a customer issue using system logs or work with APIs. &nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>You pay attention to detail:</strong> our product is very broad <em>and</em> deep, and customer inquiries can be quite tricky. You need to be able to pick up small details in support tickets, and also read between the lines. High attention to detail is core to this position and an essential daily skill to remain successful.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><strong>Willingness to go the extra mile:</strong> it’s not about answering tickets as quickly as possible. It’s about answering questions as <em>successfully</em> as possible and spending extra effort to point out even better solutions. Our customers can reach out with tough questions or bugs, so it’s important to think like the customer and propose helpful solutions and workarounds.&nbsp;</div><div><strong><br>You have an entrepreneurial and growth mindset: </strong>you are curious and motivated to learn more about our product, industry, and your own growth on a continuous basis. You have a high-energy approach to work, an eagerness to learn, and raise opportunities for improvement with your manager, team, or the entire company.&nbsp;</div><div><br>Ideally, <strong>you have a strong interest in HR and the future of work</strong> (and previous experience in the space). Our customers include some of the most innovative and forward thinking people and culture leaders around the world, and this is definitely a plus for someone to be successful in this role.<br><br></div><h3><strong>More reasons to work at SI:</strong></h3><ul><li>We’re international: We’re based in Berlin and sell mainly to the US, Australia and the UK. Our staff of 35 hails from 16 countries (all our written communication is in English)</li><li>We're self-funded — our only &quot;investors&quot; are our amazing <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/customers/' rel='nofollow'>customers</a> who have helped us grow our customer base largely through word of mouth.</li><li>We invest in our people. You’ll get a learning &amp; development budge and days off for attending conferences</li><li>We’re serious about our open and tolerant company culture, and we believe diversity makes our culture and our product better.</li><li>We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales. Also, there are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!</li><li>You’re invited to visit our Berlin head office for three weeks once a year and we cover the costs. Take an <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/office-tour/' rel='nofollow'>office tour</a>.</li><li>We want to do well by doing good, so we turn down dodgy clients and <a href='https://startup.small-improvements.com/lets-good-donations-2017/' rel='nofollow'>donate 2% of our profits</a> to charity.</li><li>And we love to travel! <a href='https://vimeo.com/293382390' rel='nofollow'>Take a look at our last company trip</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>",

We do this by connecting anyone with spare food &ndash; which can be households or local businesses &ndash; with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away &pound;800 of food each year - collectively adding up to &pound;15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile &amp; web apps.</p><br /><p>Over the past 4 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. We now have 1.3 million users who have together shared well over 2.3 million portions of food&ndash; with food being successfully shared in 49 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our Food Waste Heroes programme, with over 5,000 registered Food Waste Hero users who rescue food from local businesses, take it home and shared it with their neighbours via the OLIO app. OLIO is now looking for an intern to join the core team as we embark upon the next exciting phase in our journey.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITY &ndash; LONDON and REMOTE</strong></p><br /><p>To support the OLIO team and OLIO Food Waste Heroes, we are recruiting for a Food Waste Hero Support intern. You will report into Anna Lopez-Fujimaki, Food Waste Hero Supply &amp; Support Associate.</p><br /><p>The Food Waste Heroes (FWHs) programme involves OLIO matching small groups of waste-busting volunteers with their local street food market, farmers&rsquo; market, shop, café, bakery, deli, greengrocer, hotel or restaurant.

So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

We&rsquo;ve built the UK&rsquo;s first real-time pay-by-mile car insurance policies with a smart driving app, bringing the same level of on-demand convenience to car ownership that people now expect from taxis and take-away food.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We launched in the UK in July 2018 and our highly-engaged member base is growing quickly, so we&rsquo;re expanding our&nbsp;<a href='https://www.customerserviceexcellenceawards.co.uk/2019winners' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener'>award-winning</a>&nbsp;team to support our policyholders with excellent customer service.

We'd be looking for someone that would be able to work into the evening (sometimes up until 9/10pm), and was also available to work at the weekend. Remote working is something we could definitely consider after you've passed your first 2 months with us.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be a skilled, versatile writer and a natural communicator with a friendly and professional phone manner and a keen eye for detail. You&rsquo;ll be as comfortable using emojis as you are with semi colons, and while you&rsquo;re disciplined enough to stick to a script when needed &ndash; you should have the wit and charm to rewrite it too (when appropriate). It would help if English is your first language, but this is certainly not essential.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be proactive, upbeat and able to work both with a team and independently to solve problems and come up with new ways to keep our customer base happy. It would be ideal if you have proven experience in a customer service or support role and you get a kick out of helping improve processes to make our customer experience the best it can be.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Your day-to-day will involve answering and resolving customer queries through our in-app messenger, on the phone, on social media or via email. You may be required to do some simple data management and analysis, so a basic grasp of Excel would be handy. Technology is at the core of everything we do, and you may often have to speak with our development team to get to the bottom of issues, so it will help if you have an active interest in tech too.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>It&rsquo;s worth saying that working in an early stage startup will mean that no two days are ever the same, so the ideal candidate will relish the opportunity to get stuck in and won&rsquo;t be afraid to learn new things &ndash; appreciating that their job description is only the tip of the iceberg. There may sometimes be late nights and early mornings, but we'll have a lot of fun along the way.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>If you see this as a positive challenge and a chance to grow quickly within a role that has the potential to be whatever you make it, then you should definitely think about joining our team to help us change car insurance forever.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>YOU&rsquo;LL NEED</strong>:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>A degree in English Literature or Language, Creative Writing or similar or relevant experience in a communications or customer service role</li><br /><li>Great verbal, written and general communication skills</li><br /><li>Excellent attention to detail</li><br /><li>To be organised, process-driven and comfortable working to tight deadlines</li><br /><li>The passion and drive to succeed in a startup environment</li><br /><li>A positive outlook, patience and a good sense of humour</li><br /><li>Knowledge and experience of using social media</li><br /><li>Proficiency in Microsoft Office, particularly Excel</li><br /><li>A keen interest in technology and a desire to understand our product inside out</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>BONUS POINTS IF YOU</strong>:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Have experience of managing people (either one person or a whole team)</li><br /><li>Have had any exposure to VOIP systems or call centre switchboards</li><br /><li>Have experience of using live chat software (like Intercom), and CRM tools (like Zendesk)</li><br /><li>Have experience dealing with complaints and disputes</li><br /><li>Have experience in working with insurance claims</li><br /><li>Have experience of working in a regulated industry</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What will you get in return?</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>A competative salary package with excellent growth opportunities</li><br /><li>A&nbsp; chance to work in a lively supportive environment, where no two days are the same.</li><br /><li>A chance to be part of the UK fastest growing insurer, as one of our very earliest members of an <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.customerserviceexcellenceawards.co.uk%2F2019winners' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>award-winning</a> team.</li><br /><li>Opportunities to advance your career in any direction.

You will be a one-person team responsible for researching sales leads, reading my emails to see which emails I've sent and to whom, recording that information, and harassing me to make sure I send emails when I'm meant to. Internally we have been calling this role a &quot;Human CRM&quot;. My business is recruitment consultancy, and we are a 100% completely legitimate and above-board company -- you will be making the world a better place, rather than dealing with some shady internet marketing scam.\\n\\nMust-have skills:\\n\\n * Ability to understand written English well\\n * A terrifyingly complete attention to detail\\n * Be based (anywhere) in the EU\\n\\nThe role will take approximately 2 hours a day, and we'll pay $20 USD an hour for that. There will be days when there is literally no work to do, and days when you'll need to work 6 hours, but very little of the work is time-sensitive. This would be a good job for a stay-at-home parent who needs some extra cash, but we'll accept anyone who can get through the interview.\\n\\nThe interview process works like this. You'll need to follow the instructions below _to the letter_. They should take you less than 5 minutes. If that works, we'll send you a task that takes one hour to complete. If you do well on that, we'll give you some work to do that will take you approximately ten hours, and we'll pay you $200 to do that.\\n\\nHere's the first task. You need to email   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span> with the exact subject line &quot;I am a human CRM&quot;, without the quotes. Any variation on that, and we'll automatically reject your application. In the body of the email, please:\\n\\n* Confirm the country you live in. IT MUST BE IN THE EU.\\n* Research what would be some sensible times for a person in Bangkok, a person in London, and a person in Plovdiv to have a phone call, on October the 28th. Include a guess as to why I chose that date\\n* Summarize in exactly five sentences the plot of Romeo and Juliet\\n\\nNOTHING ELSE is required at that stage. Don't attach a CV, don't tell me about your experience. I just want the three bullet points above! A computer will read your email, and reject it if the title doesn't match.\\n\\n \\n\\n#Salary\\n$9,600\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- EU-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

The strongest candidates will possess the qualities and mindsets below:</p><ul><li><strong>You love details. </strong>You notice things that other people don’t. You approach each task you lead with an eagle eye toward details and anticipate every step and possible misstep in the process. It makes you incredibly happy when things fit together just right and projects and plans have been laid out down to the last detail. Secretly, there’s something you love about vetting a data set or proofreading a final document – you love catching and righting those small, but in your mind, critical points.</li><li><strong>You make things happen.</strong> You don’t get overwhelmed easily and you take personal responsibility for the success of your work whether it requires managing back-end processes, engaging with a team, or setting up others to execute effectively. You take pride in your integrity and follow-through on tasks. People would describe you as <em>dependable</em> and <em>driven</em>; they know when they ask you to do something, it’s as good as done.</li><li><strong>You’re a self-driven learner. </strong>You consistently seek feedback from diverse sources to learn and improve; you drive your professional development with purpose and focus on outcomes; and you have a knack for devising, implementing, and investing others in systems that improve individual and team performance. Reflecting on your work and strengthening your approach based on your reflections is second nature to you.</li><li><strong>You’re a great communicator.</strong> You value precision and clarity in language. Whatever the medium, when people receive a message from you they are crystal-clear on the purpose and any requested action. They feel respected and that their time was well-spent.</li><li><strong>You know policies like the back of your hand.</strong> You understand the importance of policies and procedures, and you take time to fully internalize them. You care about being a steward of our organization’s resources and you work to ensure that we stretch the Teach For America dollar as efficiently as possible, taking advantage of all discounts and corporate partnerships. You care about the way we spend our money and adhere to policies because you understand the stakes involved when we spend money that’s been fundraised by our colleagues.</li><li><strong>You’re a logistics master. </strong>You have superior logistics skills. You think ahead about what will be needed and strategize or make adjustments accordingly. Whether it be housing, dining, transportation or an unknown variable, you have lined up the necessary supports and resources well in advance and everyone involved in something you’re planning knows where to be, by when, and what the back-up plan is, just in case.</li><li><strong>You’re a jack of all trades. </strong>You’re flexible. You know a little bit about a lot of things and if you don’t know, you’re quick to learn. You’re willing to help out wherever needed and thrive in a fast-paced, entrepreneurial environment. You are a resourceful, results-oriented team player with a positive “can do” attitude and a sense of humor. You are skilled at managing complexity and adjust course easily and quickly when things fall off-track. You’re not thrown off by feedback (in fact, you thrive on it) and are able to incorporate and turn it around quickly.</li><li><strong>You’re a people person. </strong>You forge strong, trusting relationships with diverse groups of people. You’re empathetic and intuitive; you often know what people need or want before they do. You’re socially flexible and know how to attune and calibrate your interactional style depending on the environment, audience, or context. You are fueled by collaborating and working to make others efficient and effective. You know when a healthy dose of humor is called for. People really like you, and you really like them.</li></ul><p><strong>THE ORGANIZATION</strong><br>There are more than 16 million children growing up in poverty in the U.S., and less than 10 percent of them will graduate from college. These statistics are not a reflection of our children’s potential; we know that children growing up in poverty can and do achieve at the highest levels. Rather, these statistics reflect the systemic lack of access and opportunity for children in low-income communities.</p><p>Teach For America’s (TFA) mission is to find, develop, and support a diverse network of leaders committed to expanding opportunity for children from classrooms, schools, and every sector and field that shapes the broader systems in which schools operate. We are seeking individuals who align with our mission, core values and commitment to Diversity Equity &amp; Inclusiveness and are ready to join us in this global movement.</p><p><strong>THE PERSON</strong><br>The Associate, Executive Leadership and Learning will be responsible for:</p><ul><li><strong>ELL Team Operational Support (40%)</strong><ul><li>Manage logistics and execution for all team culture hallmarks such as birthdays, years of service, personal milestones (i.e. weddings, babies, etc.), transitions, and general team culture strategies.</li><li>Draft, edit, and get approval on the monthly team blast communication. This may include making recommendations on how to creatively increase effectiveness of these communications.</li><li>Prepare content and materials for monthly team calls in partnership with the SMD, Chief of Staff. This includes updating the scope &amp; sequence for call topics and prepping speakers and presenters.</li><li>Manage all call operations for monthly team calls. This includes saving the recording, running the zoom video-conferencing platform, sharing any presentation materials on the screen, and logging the chat.</li><li>Drive the logistics and execution of team retreats (1-2x/year). This includes finding a location, negotiating contracts, drafting communications, meal planning, budgeting, and all other operational support.</li><li>Serve as a back-up support for the SVP, ELL as needed when her executive assistant is unavailable.</li><li>Manage the Elevate year-long performance review process for all ELL team members including communications, deadline tracking, and summarizing survey results in coordination with the HA team.</li><li>One-off projects and needs</li></ul></li><li><strong>Direct support for the Advisory sub-team (two SVPs, Advisory and one Chief of Staff) (30%)</strong><ul><li>Set calendar strategy for the two SVPs, Advisory in partnership with their Chief of Staff, working to ensure their priorities are reflected in their meticulously maintained calendars and time is maximized.</li><li>Book all travel in accordance with organizational per diems while also maximizing SVPs’ time.</li><li>Coordinate with regions to plan site visit agendas, logistics and prep materials for SVPs.</li><li>Assisting SVPs with document creation and editing as needed.</li><li>Synthesizing materials and information in relation to SVPs’ regional support.</li><li>Process expense reports for the SVPs and their Chief of Staff in accordance with finance policies.</li><li>Manage the Advisory team budget and ensure accurate forecasting for spending throughout the year.</li></ul></li><li><strong>ELL Team Budget &amp; Finance Compliance (20%)</strong><ul><li>Manage and track team budget overall, ensuring we are under-spending for the fiscal year and that all spending and finance processing is compliant with org-wide policies.</li><li>Keep track of compliance across teams monthly by reviewing reports and checking in with the Office of the Chief Operating and Program Officer.</li><li>Manage team supply ordering via the Amazon Business account.</li><li>Manage the ELL Team Card and serve as a buyer liaison to help manage large purchasing and contracts across sub-teams.

The work of the Regional Operations team is particularly critical in this moment as Teach For America continues to live into a new operating model in which regions’ empowerment, accountability, and flexibility dramatically increases. Our ultimate goal is to have thriving regions working in deep partnership with local communities and leveraging each other to ensure we achieve educational equity in not only one region, but all.</p><p>Within the Regional Operations team, the Associate, Executive Leadership &amp; Learning sits on the Executive Leadership &amp; Learning (ELL) team, which strengthens the entire system of support and development for all executives and Board Chairs at Teach For America.

As we revolutionize the way people manage their expenses, being part of the Expensify team means building the easiest, fastest, and most efficient platform to automate everything expense-related. </p><p>We‘ve expanded into the UK market and set up shop in London. Help shape the team that will launch our global domination of expense reports and maintain a standard of excellence around the world.</p><p>Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most talked about perk is our <a href='https://we.are.expensify.com/explore-the-world' rel='nofollow'>Offshore</a> where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we’re going to Vietnam, do you want to join?</p><h3>About The Job</h3><p>As a Success Coach, you’ll focus on making sure that our customers are successful in using Expensify. You’ll do this by applying a deep understanding of our customers, their processes, our product and the systems that we integrate with.  Our customers come in all shapes and sizes and we do our best to make them as happy as possible (read: phenomenal support is the name of the game). When our product changes, you’ll be the point of contact for our customers via email, in product announcements, phone calls and (occasional) in-person visits.</p><h3>About You</h3><p>Joining our team means you enjoy a fast-paced and ever changing work environment. You’re fearless and relish in big challenges, working within the grey and making it concrete and clear. You’re entrepreneurial, you love supporting customers and helping them solve complex problems -- all with the ease of a trapeze artist! You’re a digital expert and love interacting with customers through email, chat, and sometimes over the phone.  Because Expensify is a simple product that connects to a variety of deceptively complex financial systems, you’re also someone who is comfortable wading in the complicated waters of accounting and simplifying it for our customers.</p><p>For the best possible fit, we’re looking for someone who can:</p><ul><li><p>Articulate complex thoughts. One moment you may be having a technical discussion with an engineer about the product implications of a new feature, before quickly moving on to working directly with a non-technical customer to fix a problem. The ideal candidate will be able to clearly articulate themselves in each scenario.</p></li><li><p>Maintain customer happiness and problem solve on their behalf by providing clear and friendly written and verbal communication.</p></li><li><p>Manage time and prioritize efficiently. Things move quickly in this environment and it’s crucial that you are able to react to new information and re-prioritize accordingly.</p></li><li><p>Learn from peers across teams in an informal fashion. After all, no one is an expert at Expensify and we're all learning things as we go. We also love anyone who's able to effectively train colleagues as we grow the team.</p></li><li><p>Do what it takes to bring the most value to the company day to day, even if it may be repetitive sometimes and not so glamorous. #oneteamonedream</p></li><li><p>Support customers day in and day out, with the understanding that a product-driven company grows nowhere without a happy customer base. Make no mistake, this role is grounded in customer support, no matter the customer size.</p></li><li><p>Say “no” and communicate that things won’t always change “now”. This helps to keep our product simple and user-friendly, but it is only possible with in-depth product knowledge and a deep understanding of the problem that the customer is trying to solve.</p></li><li><p>Bonus: Some general understanding of the accounting process, not required!</p></li></ul><h3>What We Offer</h3><ul><li><p>Full-time, salaried position</p></li><li><p>Employer match to retirement pension</p></li><li><p>100% of the premiums for Dental and Medical insurance</p></li><li><p>Free lunch</p></li><li><p>Flexible vacation policy</p></li><li><p>Last, but far from least, the company spends 3 weeks abroad as a team</p></li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Like what you see? Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are many ways to do that, but the easiest way to help us out is by answering the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>Describe a memorable experience - whether at work or in your personal life - working with a client/customer. What issue did they face, and how you were able to address their concerns? If you weren't successful addressing their concerns, why not?</p></li><li><p>Pretend you had a month to do whatever you wanted. What would you do? And would this be sufficient time to accomplish the goals you set out to achieve?</p></li><li><p>If you were tasked with analyzing customer behavior and recommending product-driven solutions, how would you approach that problem?</p></li><li><p>What do you want to do with your life, and how is Expensify a step toward those long-term goals?</p></li><li><p>How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</p></li></ol><h3>Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyways! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href='mailto:jobs@expensify.com' rel='nofollow'>jobs@expensify.com</a>. We're excited to hear from you!</h3> ",

We provide 750 companies worldwide with a feedback platform so their employees can learn from each other and grow professionally. SoundCloud, Zapier, Strava, Duolingo and many more use our SAAS solution company-wide — from the intern to the CEO.<br><br></div><div>We’re looking for a Senior Customer Success Manager who loves to help customers use our product to the full extent, and who will make them renew their contracts without hesitation.<br><br></div><div>If you’re a pragmatic self-starter and love a challenge, if you enjoy working with smart and opinionated people, then this is for you!<br><br><br></div><h3><strong>Who we are</strong></h3><div>We’re a <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/' rel='nofollow'>company of 35 people in Berlin and the US</a>. Our product is a performance feedback platform rolled out company-wide from the intern to the CEO. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives, organize one-on-one meetings, and to praise each other for a job well done</div><div>We’ve got a very <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/customer-team' rel='nofollow'>strong customer team</a> in place that we’re now looking to grow with a friendly and proactive customer success manager who is keen to work full-time remotel<br><br><br></div><h3>What you’ll do</h3><div>Our ultimate CS goal is that customers are happy and renew without hesitation. Our process is built on creating personal relationships with clients, educating them, and relaying their feedback and needs into the product roadmap. You’ll focus on the US eastern time zones, helping out with EU and PST clients clients too.<br><br></div><div>As a successul CS manager, you will</div><ul><li>Help customers during the onboarding process, ensuring they know the product and what kinds of processes can work best for their business</li><li>Lend a hand when customers need support. Advanced tickets will be handled by our support team, but clients really appreciate it when they have a single contact for most questions.</li><li>Reach out to your customers on a regular cadence, and set up 30-minute calls to learn about their challenges, to suggest improvements to their processes, and to share product news with them</li><li>Collect all the knowledge and track it in our CRM, and share the highlights (or lowlights) inside the CS team but also with product management or even company-wide</li><li>Reach out to clients in time, and ensure their renewal is something they look forward to!</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Once you got the hang of it, there’s a lot more you can get involved with:</div><ul><li>Make suggestions on how to improve our internal processes, and the product itself</li><li>Join feature development projects and represent the customer perspective</li><li>Rally customers for early-access testing, and relay back the feedback you receive</li><li>Find novel ways to help customers get more value. Collaborate with marketing, or development, or product, or sales, or support, and get things done</li></ul><div><br>You’re expected to think outside the box – anything that helps making clients more successful is fair game. We don’t lock clients into long term contracts, and we never overpromise during the sales process, so it’s very rewarding work. At the same time we definitely need to be on our toes and truly help clients, as they can literally leave any time and get their money back.</div><div><br></div><h3>Who we’re looking for</h3><div><strong>5 years of experience in comparable roles helping customers with B2B software:</strong> Our product is a web-based SAAS solution, so experience in customer success or account management with comparable online products is a must. Ideally you’ve worked on two or more products before.<br><br></div><div><strong>You are business-savvy:</strong> You see customer renewal as a top priority, and your goal is to keep churn low. You’re comfortable to prioritize, so that as many customers as possible are as likely to renew as possible.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Experience with remote work:</strong> There are many advantages to working from home: No commute, flexible location, and more. It’s not as if you’ll be entirely on your own — we communicate constantly using Hangouts, Slack, and Confluence. (Plus we’ll fly you over to Berlin once a year.) Our satellite workers are of the self-driven, comfortably autonomous variety though. So if you are naturally a self-starter and very proactive about keeping everyone in the loop, you’ll fit right in!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Process passion:</strong> You get excited at improving processes. You’ve seen lots of approaches already, and can really contribute to our processes and make them better. You’re highly structured and will prepare diligently and take copious amounts of notes about customers and their needs afterward.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Technical plus charming:</strong> You need to be tech-savvy and a fast learner, as our product is complex and supports a wide range of HR practices. At the same time, you just <em>have</em> to love people and interacting with them. You need to be an overall positive person, and your glass should always be half-full.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Willingness to go the extra mile:</strong> It’s not about making calls as quickly as possible. It’s about really helping clients, and that might involve researching or mulling over something for a few days, and then getting back to the customer once you have an even better idea/suggestion/workaround later on</div><div><br>Prior experience in HR- related topics is a major plus, and general interest in the topic is a must.<br><br><br></div><h3>More reasons to work at SI</h3><ul><li>We’re international: We’re based in Berlin and sell mainly to the US, Australia and the UK. Our staff of 35 hails from 16 countries (all our written communication is in English)</li><li>We're self-funded — our only &quot;investors&quot; are our amazing <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/customers/' rel='nofollow'>customers</a> who have helped us grow our customer base largely through word of mouth.</li><li>We invest in our people. You’ll get a learning &amp; development budge and days off for attending conferences</li><li>We’re serious about our open and tolerant company culture, and we believe diversity makes our culture and our product better.</li><li>We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales. Also, there are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!</li><li>You’re invited to visit our Berlin head office for three weeks once a year and we cover the costs. Take an <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/office-tour/' rel='nofollow'>office tour</a>.</li><li>We want to do well by doing good, so we turn down dodgy clients and <a href='https://startup.small-improvements.com/lets-good-donations-2017/' rel='nofollow'>donate 2% of our profits</a> to charity.</li><li>And we love to travel! <a href='https://vimeo.com/293382390' rel='nofollow'>Take a look at our last company trip</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul></div>",

Our customer experience specialists work remotely and all (five currently) have been with us for at least a year, forming an engaged, positive team. We don’t just handle typical support requests; we also help with inside sales efforts, and our more experienced team members have become a go-to resource for a wide range of company projects.

However, you’ll also answer inbound phone calls, and support our district partnership team with outbound calls to school or district admins to follow up on quotes they created, or emails that bounce.</p><p>In your daily work, you’ll be using a wide range of systems: ZenDesk, Slack, Asana, Zoom, in addition to the Google suite and our in-house CRM and content management system.</p><p>As you join, we’ll train you on all aspects of this job: we’ve got a robust wiki with training resources and best practices, in addition to a seasoned team eager to help you get up-to-speed. Once you’re on top of all ticket types and know Mystery well, you may also have the opportunity to work on projects for other teams in the company.</p><p>This is an opportunity to help more kids stay curious and become the next generation of problem solvers. While your work will be remote from your home office, we meet daily via Zoom as a team, and have weekly company-wide town halls.

We&rsquo;re dead set on solving the problem and looking for people to help us achieve our mission. We, at Winnow, believe that food is far too valuable to waste, and that technology can transform the way we produce food. Our team is made of people who all share a passion for food and technology.</p><br /><p>Winnow was founded in London in 2013 to help the hospitality industry prevent food waste through internet of things tools in the kitchen. We have worked with hundreds of sites and are operating in over 30 countries around the world supported by our offices in London, Dubai, Shanghai, Singapore, Romania and North America. We are a rapidly growing company with a strong base of clients who are rolling out our system globally. We have blue-chip customers including Accor Hotels, IKEA, IHG, Marriott, Compass Group and many others.</p><br /><p>Winnow&rsquo;s clients on average reduce waste by over 50% by value and sustain savings. Winnow has now worked with hundreds of sites to reduce food waste, including hotels, universities and schools, staff restaurants, event/hospitality kitchens, buffets, pubs, and high street restaurants. Where the system is permanently adopted, pre-consumer waste value is reduced by 50% - 70% with no detrimental impact to the perceived quality or value of the offer to their customers. This represents a typical improvement of food cost savings of 3% to 8%, commonly a 40%+ increase in profitability for operations.</p><br /><p>As the global leader in addressing food waste, we are committed to continue pushing the envelope on what technology can do to solve this problem. Winnow Vision, our new artificial intelligence-based technology, is trained to automatically track all food waste thrown away. It has won awards at the World Economic Forum and has been received tremendous enthusiasm from our clients and the industry.

With our customers, we challenge them if we don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re achieving their goals, whether they be environmental or financial.</p><br /><p><strong>People of action.</strong>&nbsp;Done is better than perfect, and we learn by boldly doing then rapidly improving. We&rsquo;re breaking new ground, so we know things might go wrong. But we judge ourselves and each other on our reaction and our resilience.</p><br /><p><strong>Bound by food.</strong>&nbsp;We&rsquo;re a diverse bunch, but our belief in the value of food is the common thread in everything we do. With each other, we celebrate through our love and respect for food. With our customers, it means we work hard to develop creative tools to make it easy for chefs to value food.</p><br /><p><strong>Hungry and humble.</strong>&nbsp;Our product is revolutionary, our people are impressive, and we&rsquo;re hungry for change. But, we&rsquo;re just the catalyst for a bigger movement. We stay humble regardless of our success, and make chefs the heroes in this journey.</p><br /><p>This is an opportunity to join a rapidly growing start-up (and one of Wired&rsquo;s top 100 start-ups in Europe) and help us propel our growth at what is truly the most exciting and dynamic points in time in our business.
