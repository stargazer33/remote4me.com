Here’s why…</p><p>My name is George Karanastasis. I’m the founder and CEO of Fisico. We’re a natural health company that sells supplements and nutrition programs online.</p><p>And we’re currently looking for an A-player to join our team and help assist our AMAZING customers. I’ll share the details of the position in a moment. First, a bit about our ideal candidate (please read every word the follows).</p><p>In a nutshell, it’s <strong>someone who has worked in – or is currently working in – a virtual position (i.e. highly self-disciplined and can get the job done with minimal supervision)</strong>.</p><p><strong>Furthermore, the ideal candidate is…</strong></p><ol><li>Reliable. I’m talking about very reliable. Not the, <em>“This usually doesn’t happen, but it happened again”</em> type. We’re a small team and everyone must pull their weight. That means showing up every day and on time — no exceptions (save for a major emergency).</li><li>A natural with people (i.e. very personable and someone who easily makes conversation — even with a perfect stranger). Furthermore, it’s someone who loves talking to and helping customers.</li><li>Experienced and comfortable with taking incoming calls/making outgoing calls.</li><li>Patient, kind, and courteous. The words, “please” and “thank you” should be your “go-to” words when communicating with a customer.</li><li>Happy to perform repetitive tasks and answering the same core group of questions day-in and day-out.</li><li>Is fairly tech-savvy. Nothing advanced but you must know your way around Email clients, Microsoft Office, and apps like Skype.</li><li>Fast at typing (at least 50 WPM).</li><li>Highly organized, and can multi-task with ease. The ideal candidate likely works off checklists and makes sure repetitive tasks are completed with pinpoint accuracy.</li><li>Detail orientated. Glossing over things just won’t do. In fact, try this. At the bottom of this ad you’ll find a link to an application. When you’re done reading the entire ad (and only then) click through and fill it out. The last section asks you to provide additional comments or feedback. Go ahead and write the name of your favorite song in there.</li><li>Cool and relaxed but always pushing to get things done. It’s important that you take responsibility and your main focus is always delivering results.</li></ol><p><strong>Does <u>all of the above</u> describe you? Great, then keep reading for the job description…</strong></p><p><strong>The main components of the work would be:</strong></p><ol><li>Responding to every one of our customer’s inquiries via telephone and email (online ticketing system) in a timely fashion. Typical scenarios include tracking lost packages, helping people log on to our website, issuing instructions for returns, and answering basic health questions after learning our products inside and out.</li><li>Making sure every customer is fully satisfied with the proposed resolution you put forth. And above all, keeping your cool and remaining professional when conflicts inevitably arise. If you don’t have thick skin, this position is probably not for you. Here’s why…The overwhelming majority of our customers are a pleasure to deal with. But on occasion, you will interface with someone that is irate, or rarely, even hostile. Whether justifiably so, or not, it is your duty to make things right and turn them into a raving fan.</li><li>Processing credits for customers who choose to return items.</li><li>Communicating with our fulfillment team to identify and correct mistakes with shipments.</li><li>As well as several other administrative/web-based tasks related to customer care…</li></ol><p><strong>This is a full-time, work from home position. </strong></p><p>OK, if you’re still reading this, there’s a chance you could be a fit for this position. Again, we’re looking for a dependable, detail-orientated, and easy-going (yet professional) person to join our team. If you’re confident you’re a fit, then please let me know by visiting the link below and submitting an application.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.fisicoinc.com/jobs/customer-support.php' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We do this using a combination of human stylists and powerful machine learning algorithms to recommend each guy the perfect things just for them—in their size, budget, and style—which they can then buy in one place.<br /><br />*Operations at Thread*<br /><br />Making it easy to dress well - and building a business around it - requires operational excellence. Our goal is to create a seamless end-to-end experience, from discovering the perfect item to having it delivered quickly and easily to a place of your choice. Our operations team is critical to this goal, focused on providing our users with an amazing post-purchase experience. We’re looking for an outstanding ops associate with strong administrative skills to help us continue to improve. You will be an important part of this small, dynamic and friendly team. Your role will be fast paced and varied but you’ll execute tasks in a way that makes things seem effortless for our users. If you are highly organised, fast paced, reliable, resilient and keen, this role could be for you. <br /><br />*The role:*<br /><br />Your role will be split across two areas of responsibility. Firstly, you’ll be responsible for placing orders with our third party suppliers, making sure that the orders are accurate and sent before the appropriate cut-off time. Secondly, you’ll be the first point of contact for customers with queries about Thread. You’ll either investigate and resolve these queries, or escalate them to a senior team member where appropriate. <br /><br />After initial training sessions in our office in Aldgate, you’ll be able to work remotely most of the time. We might ask you to come to our office occasionally for training sessions. The role guarantees a minimum of 10 to 15 hours a week (spread across morning, day and evening shifts on weekdays and weekends), with frequent opportunities to pick up more hours on top of that. We’re happy to negotiate the hours and shift times in line with our requirements. We’re currently particularly keen for someone who has the flexibility to do a shift or two on weekends as well as day shifts on weekdays. <br /><br />*Your core responsibilities will include:*<br /><br />* First point of contact for our users - field all queries coming through to our support ticketing system and decide on the best pathway for each.<br />* Resolve queries and issues efficiently and to a high standard. Make sure our users come away feeling like they had a mindblowing customer experience.<br />* Contribute towards hitting our support response time and customer satisfaction targets.<br />* Own resolving tickets regarding fulfilment problems, technical issues, feedback and more.<br />* Identify and escalate issues to other teams within the company, including senior ops associates, styling, product and engineering.<br />* Advocate for users internally by passing on their feedback and pain-points to the wider team.<br />* Ensure the smooth running of our “just in time” fulfilment process by placing orders with suppliers in line with cut-off times.<br />* Own hitting our buying cut-off targets, and contribute directly to our shipping time targets.<br /><br />*Are you the one? You are, if you:*<br /><br />* Possess a collaborative “whatever it takes” attitude; be someone who won’t give up until a problem is fixed and who’s not afraid to push and lead others to a resolution.<br />* Excel at finding ways to get around a problem; at times you won’t have the answer you need straight away and will need to think on your feet.<br />* Have superb attention to detail; nothing gets past you.<br />* Constantly think about how we can improve our processes; never be satisfied with a process that isn’t perfect.<br />* Have excellent organisational skills. You make great notes and leave a clear path for others to follow.<br />* Are known for being reliable to your core. Your friends and previous employers would describe you as totally dependable.<br />* Possess exceptional communication skills, being both professional and effective over email.<br />* Are comfortable working across different platforms and channels of communication. You don’t have to be a computer pro, but you’re confident jumping from the support dashboard to the buying page, from your email to a spreadsheet.<br /><br />*Benefits:*<br /><br />* This is a flexible role in which you’re welcome to work remotely for most of your hours.<br />* You’ll be working closely with the core ops team and will be involved in the smooth running of our support and buying shifts.<br />* You’ll get first-hand experience of the day to day workings of the operations team in a tech start-up.<br />* Competitive compensation: £10/hour, plus holiday and sick pay.<br /><br />*How to apply:*<br /><br />Email us with your CV and a cover letter, and we’ll be in touch!",

We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct&nbsp;.</p><a href='https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct' rel='nofollow'>here</a><p>Why You Should Join</p><p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p><p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p><p>Where We Can Hire</p><p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p><div> <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/e5ce7220-d249-4a01-b075-eceae6872cd8' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a></div>",

You’ll be responsible for providing tremendous customer service and support via email for all versions of Basecamp and our other apps. You’ll help us answer questions via Twitter, make some customer calls, create and edit help documentation, run personalized demos, and teach some online classes. You’ll also have ample opportunities to carve out your own passion projects related to supporting our customers.</p><br><strong> About the Job </strong><br><br><p>Deep technical knowledge of computer programming is not a prerequisite, however you should be well-versed in basic troubleshooting techniques to solve issues caused by most Internet Gremlins. The ability to think beyond clearing cache and cookies in order to troubleshoot the specific issue that’s reported is essential.</p><p>During training, you’ll be expected to be proactive in your process and learn quickly. Once fully up-to-speed (2-3 months), you’ll write about 100 emails per day. This is a significant volume, so be sure that you’re ready and able to deal with that kind of daily load — you’ll get all the support and guidance you need along the way! We’re looking for some great writers who love helping people, so you should enjoy making complicated situations simple and painless. This means being a great problem-solver with the ability to process and resolve issues quickly. You should be a stellar communicator, even when you have to communicate less-than-stellar news. You should have highly tuned senses of compassion and empathy and a drive to constantly help others.</p><br><strong> About You </strong><br><br><p>We have a rhythm to our work and a low turnover rate — more than half of the team has been at Basecamp for over five years.

Basecamp is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.</p><p>Our pay is within the top 10% of the industry, for the matched role and experience, based on San Francisco rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;no matter where you live.

Our goal was to improve workplaces for women and connect the best employers with top talent. In 2018, we launched in the UK and we're supporting employers such as Dell, HSBC, King and Symantec.  <br /><br />WORK180 is doing what no other job platform has done before. Businesses who do not meet our benchmark, are not allowed to advertise their jobs. Employers are lifting the bar when it comes to creating supportive workplaces for women. This includes increasing paid parental leave, closing gender pay gaps and increasing the number of women in leadership.<br /><br />We have ambitious future plans and we're looking for people who are driven and passionate about our mission to join us.<br /><br />*The role*<br /><br />As a Customer Success Manager in our Inclusion Strategy team, you’ll be working with our endorsed employers and advising them on strategy for diverse hiring whilst building long-lasting relationships. Your meetings will involve employer branding consultations and ensuring all clients are obtaining maximum value from the WORK180 endorsement. <br /><br />At WORK180, we work fully flexible roles, trusting you to work from wherever you prefer your workstation to be. It could be your local cafe, at home - wherever you feel most comfortable and productive.<br /><br />*Your experience;*<br /><br />*Previous experience in either: account management, customer success,  recruitment or diversity & inclusion - for great conversations with our clients.<br />*Presentation skills – you’re familiar with commanding a meeting and taking clients through a slide deck.<br />*Comfort in prioritizing goals and meeting tight schedules. When you own accounts, they will be yours and you will look after driving their strategy.<br />*Initiative – you’ll have full autonomy. To achieve, we need you to identify problems and suggest scalable solutions as we are growing quickly.<br /><br />*Why work for us?*<br /><br />Genna Kalish, our Community Engagement Manager in the UK says &quot;When you join WORK180, you are not just starting a new job. You are creating social change and empowering women globally. We are all given an incredible amount of trust and flexibility and are able to forge our own careers.&quot;<br /><br />If you're interested in this role then please click Apply or reach out to Sarah Cooper, Head of People and Culture ",

    "content": "<h2> Support Engineer, Trello</h2><div>Developer<br></div><div>UK, Netherlands, Germany, Turkey<br></div><div>Company: Atlassian<br></div><div>Full Time<br></div><h3>Overview</h3><p>Customer support at Trello is different.</p><p>To start with, we let our customers decide if they want to pay us or not. Seriously. If our customers are not amazingly happy, they get their money back with no questions asked. Our front line staff are empowered to make our customers happy. Usually, it means tapping a broad range of resources, whether that’s making sure you have all the right software, or working directly with an engineer to troubleshoot a case. You’ll have what you need to get the job done.</p><p>You will not be glued to the queue. Sure, we need to get back to customers via email—that will always be there—but support is so much more than grinding through an inbox. This is a real problem-solving job. You’ll have an incredible amount of autonomy in determining how best to contribute your talents and skills to Trello. Think a short video will help customers get started? Make it. Want to write a script to help a customer with the API? Go for it. There’s plenty of room for creativity and technical exploration when it comes to better serving our customers.</p><p>The other side of support is working with the other teams at Trello. All of our teams—engineering, marketing, sales, etc—benefit from support’s role in working directly with customers. It will be your job to figure out how we can serve them as effectively as possible. This is no small task, especially when communication is happening asynchronously across time zones. For example, when working with the engineering team, you need to know when a bug can stay under the radar versus when you should sound the alarm.</p><p>Additionally, Atlassian is a terrific place to work. Great products and a fantastic reputation in business and tech have brought in customers globally, including NASA, Sony, and the United Nations. With offices in Sydney, San Francisco, Austin, Amsterdam, and remote folks all over we are growing really fast and are full of opportunities!</p><p></p><strong></strong><em>The Trello Support Engineer can be located in any of the following countries: Netherlands, UK, Germany, Turkey. This is a fully remote position.</em><p></p><strong>Job summary</strong><p>We don’t want people to just use Trello, we want them to love it. We’re looking to add a person to our support team who is friendly, helpful, and already loves Trello. Your top priority will be to transform our users into super-fans.</p><p></p><strong>You’ll do this by:</strong><ul></ul><li>Troubleshooting and answering their questions via email and social media</li><li>Configuring and troubleshooting SAML-based SSO setups with Trello Enterprise customers, both by email and over the phone when necessary</li><li>Relaying insights from customers on to our product team</li><li>Providing service status updates via our StatusPage and social media</li><li>Crafting documentation and other support materials that empower users to serve themselves</li><p>We use a variety of tools to ensure fluid communication between our customers, support, and the product team. These include email, social media, written documentation, video, internal chat, and Trello itself. Your ability to listen to customers, identify common themes, and communicate clearly will be incredibly valuable to our users and our team.</p><p></p><strong>More about you</strong><p>We’re believe a great candidate can hit that sweet spot between a technical and a customer facing role. You have a drive to learn new technologies and are responsible for owning customer issues until resolution. You’re a great fit if you have top notch written and verbal communication skills, along with a comfort communicating with customers. You have basic Operation Systems knowledge (Mac and Windows), familiarity with reading console errors, and a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science or equivalent demonstrated experience.</p><p></p><strong>Requirements</strong><ul></ul><li>Knowledge of Trello and passion for the product</li><li>Previous experience providing email support as a primary job responsibility. You’ve done full-time professional email-based support before.</li><li>Experience with Enterprise-grade SAML configuration and/or troubleshooting, or equivalent technical experience in that area</li><li>Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript</li><li>The ability to communicate clearly and positively through written and spoken English</li><li>A broad creative or technical curiosity</li><li>Two-year commitment to working in support at Trello.</li><li>Comfort working independently—in some cases you will be the only team member working, based on timezone. You’ll work within the standard working hours of your timezone.</li><p></p><strong>One or more of the following skills would also contribute to your role on the support team:</strong><ul></ul><li>Strong writing skills</li><li>Experience working remotely, or on a heavily-remote team</li><li>Programming experience in any language</li><li>Fluency in languages in addition to English</li><p></p><strong>More about our team</strong><p>We are a different kind of software company: one that listens to client needs, values innovation and solves customer problems with brilliant simplicity. If you start your career with Atlassian, you’ll have a direct impact on millions of users, fast! You won’t get frustrated with bureaucracy or slow decision making, because we encourage innovative thinking. We don’t just want to know your opinions, we want to see your ideas in action. We hire great people and then trust them to be great. Keyword: TRUST.</p><p></p><strong>More about our benefits</strong><p>Whether you work in an office or a distributed team, Atlassian is highly collaborative and yes, fun! To support you at work (and play) we offer some fantastic perks: ample time off to relax and recharge, flexible working options, five paid volunteer days a year for your favourite cause, an annual allowance to support your learning &amp; growth, unique ShipIt days, a company paid trip after five years and lots more.</p><p></p><strong>More about Atlassian</strong><p>Software is changing the world, and we’re at the center of it all. With a customer list that reads like a who’s who in tech, and a highly disruptive business model, we’re advancing the art of team collaboration with products like Jira Software, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Trello. Driven by honest values, an amazing culture, and consistent revenue growth, we’re out to unleash the potential of every team. From Amsterdam and Austin to Sydney and San Francisco, we’re looking for people who are powered by passion and eager to do the best work of their lives in a highly autonomous yet collaborative, no B.S. environment.</p><p></p><strong>Additional Information</strong><p>We believe that the unique contributions of all Atlassians is the driver of our success. To make sure that our products and culture continue to incorporate everyone’s perspectives and experience we never discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, or marital, veteran, or disability status.</p><p>All your information will be kept confidential according to EEO guidelines.</p><div> <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/atlassian/45b50895-430a-47c2-93d8-066adadef786' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a></div>",

These members cost health plans millions of medical dollars primarily due to preventable ambulance usage, medical ER visits and medical inpatient admissions. Despite having a BH diagnosis, their BH spending is relatively minor or non-existent.</p><p>Catasys uses a proprietary analytics platform and predictive modeling to identify high utilizers of medical healthcare services with costs that can be significantly reduced by addressing the underlying BH disorder(s). Through proactive outreach, we engage and treat these individuals in our patient-centric program that integrates evidence-based medical interventions, psychosocial skill building and care coaching by nurses.</p><p>The end result is improved health and quality of life for the member, and a 50% reduction in claims costs to the health plan.</p><p>The<strong> Care Coach </strong>is responsible for engagement, enrollment, and coordination of care to improve the health and quality of life for members of the Catasys OnTrak program. Care Coaches utilize existing clinical and functional assessments of client progress, employ targeted intervention and education, and coordinate care pertaining to clients identified issue(s). The Care Coach utilizes Motivational Interviewing techniques to elicit active member participation. In addition, the Care Coach is responsible for the coordination of member care throughout the treatment continuum: medical intervention, relapse prevention, treatment of co-morbid conditions, and issues identified through the individual care plan.</p><ol><li>Uses exceptional written and verbal communication skills to engage, enroll, and maintain members in active participation in the OnTrak program as well as to coordinate member care.</li><li>Conducts superior motivational interviewing, enhancement, and relapse prevention guidelines in telephonic communication with clients.</li><li>Demonstrates superior knowledge of the Catasys OnTrak treatment program and usage of the eOnTrak electronic documentation platform.</li><li>Provides exemplary customer service to and member-centric focus for, all clients.</li><li>Communicates or requests information from providers in complete compliance with confidentiality standards and in a manner that generates cooperation.</li><li>Complies with Catasys policies and procedures, including training, audits, alert response timeliness, intervention and follow-through, supervision receptiveness, as well as other Catasys policies and procedures related to the provision of services.</li><li>Complies with Catasys Human Resource policies and procedures.</li><li>Supports and meets any Catasys accreditation, auditing, contracted stakeholder reporting expectation.</li><li>Works jointly with the Clinical Care Coordinator to support member referral, engagement, and enrollment into the OnTrak program.</li><li>Supports enhancement of the eOnTrak electronic documentation platform by providing feedback to the development team and performing ad hoc system testing as indicated.</li></ol><p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p><p><strong>Qualified candidate will be a licensed RN/LPN/LVN with a strong interest in behavioral health. </strong>A minimum of three years of direct clinical experience in an acute care setting is required, a background in psych or chemical dependency is a bonus.

    "content": "*Contractor to join an intrapreneurial start-up venture building an employability solution*<br /><br />At Pearson we have a rare opportunity for a driven, entrepreneurial individual who is excited to get the experience of working on an employability start-up, with the unique benefits of innovation coaches and corporate backing by Pearson - the world's leading learning company with global reach and market-leading businesses.  <br /><br />In 2018 a small team of employees from Pearson VUE successfully pitched to receive £200k of seed-stage funding from Pearson’s internal incubator, the Tomorrow’s Markets Incubator (TMI). The Tomorrow’s Markets Incubator is designed to build completely new products, with new business models, that reach new customer markets for Pearson, and deliver social impact through reaching underserved communities.<br /><br />The team have completed comprehensive market research and are in the ‘prototype phase’ of the incubator. They are in the process of taking a concept on paper and turning it into an actual business (the minimum viable venture) that is ready to begin pilot sales. Ventures in the incubator follow a unique ‘venture innovation’ methodology, and the Field Assistant will be expected to learn and effectively apply that methodology in their role, in support of the Venture Director and Field Lead.<br /><br />In addition to direct funding, the Tomorrow’s Markets Incubator provides support to venture teams by way of strategic guidance and hands-on coaching that the Field Assistant will benefit from. <br /><br /><br />*The Role*  <br /><br />The Venture Field Assistant will join a small, dynamic team of employees from Pearson VUE. In this career-enhancing opportunity, it will be your responsibility to:<br /><br />* Assist the Venture Field Lead to conduct desk, academic and in-field customer research with diverse customer demographics and employer organisations. This will include designing the research plan, building research guides, identifying who to interview, executing research to uncover unarticulated pain points and taking detailed notes<br /><br />* Ability to synthesise both quantitative and qualitative research into key findings, to demonstrate an understanding of the market and strategic realities within a corporation and use insight to drive a fully-fledged start-up that is capable of generating significant revenue<br /><br />* Help analyse successes and failures from any testing of the ‘minimum viable venture’ (note: this includes not just testing the product but the marketing, HR support, customer acquisition, etc.)<br /><br />* Build exceptional relationships with internal and external stakeholders (including the Pearson leadership team, the TMI investment committee, potential customers, etc.) <br /><br />* Help with day-to-day project management: scheduling meetings, collating meeting notes, writing regular status reports to the core TMI team, communicating with precision and clarity on the venture’s latest progress and next steps<br /><br />* Track and monitor key performance indicators, including compiling reports as inputs into operational and/or financial modelling activities e.g. researching market wages<br /><br />* Use own initiative to ensure the team stays “on track” to plan, be adaptable to take on a diverse range of tasks, to manage multiple deadlines and deliverable, and to effectively manage own workload in a dynamic and ever changing startup environment (e.g. can work under pressure).<br /><br />You will come with a strong academic background and some professional and/or entrepreneurial experience, perhaps having contributed to start-up businesses in your career, and ideally with good knowledge of the education and/or recruitment industry. <br /><br />We are looking for someone with a strong can-do attitude, great people skills, entrepreneurial spirit, determination to problem solve in an uncertain environment and evolving project definition of success. As the Venture Field Assistant, you will have strong research and analytical skills (both exploratory and evaluative), experience reporting and KPI tracking, an eye for detail, be highly organised and able to independently structure and lead your own work. You will be working in a fast paced, detail oriented and flexible environment and must be open to adapting your knowledge and skills to suit the requirements of the accelerator programme and are comfortable with non-traditional work hours. Think start-up rather than corporate!<br /><br />In return, you will gain hands on experience in all aspects of venture development (e.g. how to build a profitable business), learn a proprietary venture innovation methodology, get exposure to experienced innovation coaches and be part of the team redefining recruitment.<br /><br />You will report to the Venture Field Lead, and work closely with the Venture Director, Tomorrow’s Market Incubator external support team and an experienced venture innovation coach. Key to the success of this position will be working closely with the Venture Field Lead, following directives in a support role, to build a minimum viable venture. <br /><br /><br />*The Opportunity* <br /><br />Venture Field Assistant<br />* Flexible working location (field office and/or home-based)<br />* London/Manchester based with monthly travel opportunities to Manchester/ London <br />* Project expected to last up to 6 months (with potential option for contract renewal) <br />* Pay rate up to £22,500 - £28,000  pro-rata, working full-time hours <br />* Independent contractor<br /><br /><br />*How to Apply*<br /><br />Please complete the answers below and send to Alexandra.Simmons@pearson.com along with a copy of your CV. <br /><br />We are reviewing applications regularly and interviews are being scheduled now, therefore we encourage you to submit your application as soon as possible. Should you have any questions please message Alexandra.<br /><br />Wishing you the very best of success with your application! <br /><br /><br />*Application Questions*<br /><br />1/ What is the biggest challenge with the way employment  / recruitment currently happens today?  <br /><br />2/ What elements are needed to make a venture successful? <br /> <br />3/ Please tell us about a recent project where you have been responsible for completing in-depth research to uncover insights using both consumer research and data analysis. <br />_[We are interested in your approach to problem solving through research, your ability to identify themes, and how you collate and validate ideas]_<br /><br />4/ What other skills or experience do you have, that we did not mention in the job description, but would make you particularly effective at this role?<br /><br />5/ Why are you interested in this role?<br /><br />",

You’ll help us answer questions via Twitter, make some customer calls, create and edit help documentation, run personalized demos, and teach some online classes. You’ll also have ample opportunities to carve out your own passion projects related to supporting our customers.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Deep technical knowledge of computer programming is not a prerequisite, however you should be well-versed in basic troubleshooting techniques to solve issues caused by most Internet Gremlins. The ability to think beyond clearing cache and cookies in order to troubleshoot the specific issue that’s reported is essential.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>During training, you'll be expected to be proactive in your process and learn quickly. Once fully up-to-speed (2-3 months), you'll write about 100 emails per day. This is a significant volume, so be sure that you’re ready and able to deal with that kind of daily load -- you'll get all the support and guidance you need along the way!</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong>About You</strong></div><div><span>We’re looking for some great writers who love helping people, so you should enjoy making complicated situations simple and painless. This means being a great problem-solver with the ability to process and resolve issues quickly. You should be a stellar communicator, even when you have to communicate less-than-stellar news. You should have highly tuned senses of compassion and empathy and a drive to constantly help others.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We have a rhythm to our work and a low turnover rate -- more than half of the team has been at Basecamp for over five years.

You want to be part of our support team for a while, and you’re excited to contribute to making Basecamp the best product for our customers.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>A big part of the role itself is supporting each other, so you should understand the value in prioritizing relationships with your colleagues.</span></div><div><span>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company. Basecamp is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><strong>About Our Pay and Benefits</strong></div><div><span>Our pay is within the top 10% of the industry, for the matched role and experience, based on San Francisco rates.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fm.signalvnoise.com%2Fminimum-pay-at-basecamp-is-now-70000%2F' rel='nofollow'>We also believe in fair, living wages at Basecamp</a><span>&nbsp;</span><span>no matter where you live.

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Many of these restaurant chains hire software development teams to create a wide variety of custom applications and websites that integrate with Olo’s APIs. Likewise, the emergence of third party restaurant marketplaces and delivery services has opened new sales channels for restaurant chains, and Olo enables those channels via integrations to our APIs. We also work with a broad array of food delivery providers, POS vendors, and loyalty platform providers who integrate their solutions into the Olo Platform to enable a complete digital ordering experience. Working on Olo’s Developer Support team will give you the opportunity to assist developers from the most innovative and notable tech companies in the food space.   <br>   <br>Olo is transforming the digital ordering landscape for restaurant chains in an ever-evolving ecosystem, and we're looking for a talented engineer and support specialist to join our team in the role of a Developer Support Engineer to help us achieve our vision. You will play a significant and visible role in helping our partners incorporate online ordering into their own applications and solutions. Your primary role will be to provide developer-level support for developers who are integrating to our APIs.

Specifically, you will answer daily technical questions from a wide variety of integration partners related to the functional behavior of our APIs, and you will investigate and resolve problems they report with their integration.   <br>   <br>* You will evolve our Developer Portal to provide a complete technical repository of information, documentation, and tools that our partners will use to incorporate Olo online ordering into their products.   <br>   <br>* This is a unique role that requires a special combination of responsibilities: daily developer support, great documentation writing, and the ability to both interpret and write quality software.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>   <br>   <br>* A passion for computing that extends beyond work   <br>   <br>* Excellent English writing and communication skills   <br>   <br>* Enjoys the daily variability of a developer support role and the need to sometimes jump in and help untangle ambiguous problems   <br>   <br>* At least 3 years on-the-job software development experience   <br>   <br>* Excellent knowledge of C#, .NET and object oriented concepts   <br>   <br>* Comfortable in multiple programming languages and frameworks   <br>   <br>* Experience developing or integrating to a RESTful API   <br>   <br>* Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)   <br>   <br>* A good working knowledge of ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS   <br>   <br>* BS in Computer Science or related field, or comparable industry experience   <br>   <br>* Legal right to work in the U.S.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Beneficial   <br>   <br>   <br>* Experience in a technical support or developer support role   <br>   <br>* Experience with technical writing in a software environment   <br>   <br>* Experience working in Zendesk   <br>   <br>   <br>  </div> </div>",

In this&nbsp;, board member Stephen Colbert tells the organization’s story.</p><a href='http://www.donorschoose.org' rel='nofollow'></a><strong>DonorsChoose.org</strong><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=gxWPM2LMJ6I' rel='nofollow'>clip</a><p>Since our launch in 2000, more than 3 million “citizen philanthropists” have donated to classroom projects on DonorsChoose.org, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 28 million students in public schools, overwhelmingly from low-income households. Along the way, the organization helped to pioneer the field of crowdfunding and is now making an impact&nbsp;beyond school supplies.</p><p>Through its&nbsp;dedicated team&nbsp;and culture, DonorsChoose.org earned recognition as the #1 “Best Nonprofit to Work For” by the </p><em>Nonprofit Times.</em><p></p><strong>About the Customer Support team:</strong><p>As a branch of the Operations team at DonorsChoose.org, Customer Support is responsible for all one-to-one touchpoints — reactive and proactive — and self-service tools that help teachers, donors, administrators, or any member of the general public successfully use our website.</p><p>As a small and mighty remote team, autonomy and ownership are of the highest value. The quality of our support is a shared responsibility across the team and we all bring ideas to the table to improve our work. We appreciate and take advantage of the time we have to get in sync — one weekly team touchpoint, monthly check-ins with managers, and a vibrant Slack community — but we also deeply value and prioritize our ability to focus on solving customer inquiries.</p><p>Finally, we are passionate about serving our customer base — we get to help people bring classroom projects to life and enrich learning experiences! — and believe in support that is kind, personalized, and simple. We go the extra mile when we need to, give people the benefit of the doubt, and take pride in providing engaged and complete support. We get that providing exceptional support to teachers and donors adds value to the DonorsChoose.org mission. We are pretty darn awesome!</p><p></p><strong>About the role:</strong><p>As a Customer Support Specialist at DonorsChoose.org, you’ll answer between 50 – 120 emails a day (depending on the day). These inquiries will span a variety of different topics across the entire teacher and donor lifecycles.</p><p>You may help a donor navigate our marketplace to support a school in their hometown. Or you may help a teacher get donations multiplied by qualifying for a partner-backed offer. You may walk a mother through surprising her daughter (a first-year teacher!) by fully funding her classroom project. Or you may spend some time tracking down a shipment of live crickets (yikes!) for a sixth-grade science class.

In this&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=gxWPM2LMJ6I' rel='nofollow'>clip</a>, board member Stephen Colbert tells the organization’s story.</p><p>Since our launch in 2000, more than 3 million “citizen philanthropists” have donated to classroom projects on DonorsChoose.org, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 28 million students in public schools, overwhelmingly from low-income households. Along the way, the organization helped to pioneer the field of crowdfunding and is now making an impact&nbsp;beyond school supplies.</p><p>Through its&nbsp;dedicated team&nbsp;and culture, DonorsChoose.org earned recognition as the #1 “Best Nonprofit to Work For” by the&nbsp;<em>Nonprofit Times.</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the Customer Support Team:</strong></p><p>As a branch of the Operations team at DonorsChoose.org, Customer Support is responsible for all one-to-one touchpoints — reactive and proactive — and self-service tools that help teachers, donors, administrators, or any member of the general public successfully use our website.</p><p>As a small and mighty remote team, autonomy and ownership are of the highest value. The quality of our support is a shared responsibility across the team and we all bring ideas to the table to improve our work. We appreciate and take advantage of the time we have to get in sync — one weekly team touchpoint, monthly check-ins with managers, and a vibrant Slack community — but we also deeply value and prioritize our ability to focus on solving customer inquiries.</p><p>Finally, we are passionate about serving our customer base — we get to help people bring classroom projects to life and enrich learning experiences! — and believe in support that is kind, personalized, and simple. We go the extra mile when we need to, give people the benefit of the doubt, and take pride in providing engaged and complete support. We get that providing exceptional support to teachers and donors adds value to the DonorsChoose.org mission. We are pretty darn awesome!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the role:</strong></p><p>As a Customer Support Specialist at DonorsChoose.org, you’ll answer between 50 – 120 emails a day (depending on the day). These inquiries will span a variety of different topics across the entire teacher and donor lifecycles.</p><p>You may help a donor navigate our marketplace to support a school in their hometown. Or you may help a teacher get donations multiplied by qualifying for a partner-backed offer. You may walk a mother through surprising her daughter (a first-year teacher!) by fully funding her classroom project. Or you may spend some time tracking down a shipment of live crickets (yikes!) for a sixth-grade science class. And sometimes you’ll have to do things like explain policies that won’t make the customer super happy, deliver difficult news about eligibility, or simply help a customer reset a password. It’s not all glamor and live insects, but at the end of every day, you’ll have helped a bunch of people bring joy to a bunch of students!</p><p>In addition to this core work, sometimes you’ll —</p><p>Hop on the phone to resolve particularly gnarly issues.

Many of these restaurant chains hire software development teams to create a wide variety of custom applications and websites that integrate with Olo’s APIs. Likewise, the emergence of third party restaurant marketplaces and delivery services has opened new sales channels for restaurant chains, and Olo enables those channels via integrations to our APIs. We also work with a broad array of food delivery providers, POS vendors, and loyalty platform providers who integrate their solutions into the Olo Platform to enable a complete digital ordering experience. Working on Olo’s Developer Support team will give you the opportunity to assist developers from the most innovative and notable tech companies in the food space.</p><p>Olo is transforming the digital ordering landscape for restaurant chains in an ever-evolving ecosystem, and we're looking for a talented engineer and support specialist to join our team in the role of a Developer Support Engineer to help us achieve our vision.

Along the way, the organization helped to pioneer the field of crowdfunding and is now making an impact&nbsp;beyond school supplies.</div><div><br></div><div>Through its&nbsp;dedicated team&nbsp;and culture, DonorsChoose.org earned recognition as the #1 “Best Nonprofit to Work For” by the&nbsp;<em>Nonprofit Times.</em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><b>About the Customer Support Team:</b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>As a branch of the Operations team at DonorsChoose.org, Customer Support is responsible for all one-to-one touchpoints — reactive and proactive — and self-service tools that help teachers, donors, administrators, or any member of the general public successfully use our website.</div><div><br></div><div>As a small and mighty remote team, autonomy and ownership are of the highest value. The quality of our support is a shared responsibility across the team and we all bring ideas to the table to improve our work. We appreciate and take advantage of the time we have to get in sync — one weekly team touchpoint, monthly check-ins with managers, and a vibrant Slack community — but we also deeply value and prioritize our ability to focus on solving customer inquiries.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, we are passionate about serving our customer base — we get to help people bring classroom projects to life and enrich learning experiences! — and believe in support that is kind, personalized, and simple. We go the extra mile when we need to, give people the benefit of the doubt, and take pride in providing engaged and complete support. We get that providing exceptional support to teachers and donors adds value to the DonorsChoose.org mission. We are pretty darn awesome!</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>About the role:</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>As a Customer Support Specialist at DonorsChoose.org, you’ll answer between 50 – 120 emails a day (depending on the day). These inquiries will span a variety of different topics across the entire teacher and donor lifecycles.</div><div><br></div><div>You may help a donor navigate our marketplace to support a school in their hometown. Or you may help a teacher get donations multiplied by qualifying for a partner-backed offer. You may walk a mother through surprising her daughter (a first-year teacher!) by fully funding her classroom project. Or you may spend some time tracking down a shipment of live crickets (yikes!) for a sixth-grade science class. And sometimes you’ll have to do things like explain policies that won’t make the customer super happy, deliver difficult news about eligibility, or simply help a customer reset a password. It’s not all glamor and live insects, but at the end of every day, you’ll have helped a bunch of people bring joy to a bunch of students!</div><div><br></div><div>In addition to this core work, sometimes you’ll —</div><div><br></div><div>Hop on the phone to resolve particularly gnarly issues. (We work primarily in email right now, but sometimes it’s just easier to get on the phone and hash it out!)<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Attend and participate in trainings as scheduled by your team leaders.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Provide feedback to your peers on their tickets and coach newer teammates.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Build documentation to support our work.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Write up bug reports for our Product and Engineering team.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Update or write public-facing help content.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Answer support questions for colleagues across the organization.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Lead mini-projects or fact-finding missions — and present ideas or findings to teammates, managers, or others across the organization.</div><div><br></div><div><span>As a successful Customer Support Specialist, you are:</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Professional.</b>&nbsp;You are the face of DonorsChoose.org to many of its customers. As such, you hold yourself to a high standard. You are task-driven, attentive, collaborative, and accountable. Particularly as a remote professional, you can work autonomously and don’t require a ton of supervision.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b>A solid communicator.</b>&nbsp;It is your job to be clear and concise, to gain agreement on issues, to match tone and be understood by customers who have varied technical experiences and diverse backgrounds. You are a great writer and are not afraid of the phone.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Thoughtful.</b></span>&nbsp;You take pride in your work and care about outcomes. You think “What if I were in this position? What would I want to hear right now?”&nbsp;You foster positive experiences even when it means saying no or sharing difficult or highly-technical information.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Tech comfy.</b></span>&nbsp;You’ll use Zendesk (a ticket management platform), the DonorsChoose.org administrative site, and other third-party applications (Slack, GSuite, and more) in your daily work. You are supporting the use of a two-sided marketplace and want to learn the ins and outs of how it all works. You know basic troubleshooting techniques.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>A learner.</b></span>&nbsp;You recognize that you are always in a position to learn and that you can learn from anyone at any time, including customers. This makes you flexible to change and open to feedback on your work.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Decisive.</b></span>&nbsp;You’ll make judgment calls and decisions based on your knowledge of our policies and processes. You have a bias toward action. You recognize you might make mistakes or occasionally say the wrong thing to a customer, but are confident in your ability to own mistakes and learn from them.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Resourceful.</b></span>&nbsp;Not every question has an easy answer, but you’re totally into figuring things out. You’ve maybe used Nancy Drew as a verb (i.e., “I’m gonna Nancy Drew this.”) and successfully discovered the answer to something tricky. (And you’ll be able to tell us about this in an interview!)<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Generous.</b></span>&nbsp;Once you figure something out, you’re excited to share the new information. You want to lend your ideas to the team and make everyone around you stronger.</div><div><br></div><div>You might also be (not required, but let us know if this is you!):<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><em>A customer support pro.</em>&nbsp;You already have experience providing customer support and genuinely enjoy working with people to solve problems.

And we love the fact that by helping our clients become more successful and impact more people, we’re doing our part to make the world just a little bit better off.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re a small agency with big growth objectives ourselves. We’ve spent the past couple of years preparing for massive revenue growth NOW!</div><div><br></div><div>You can learn more here:</div><div><br></div><div><a href='https://www.crushmymarket.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.crushmymarket.com</a></div><div><br></div><div><h3>What We're Looking For</h3></div><div><br></div><div>We have tremendously high standards in the work we produce and the results we deliver, and are looking for someone who shares that value and is highly talented in their own right.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’ve worked at a marketing agency, great - that can help. But it’s not required at all.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’ve had training in project management, sure - that’s nice. But, again, not at all required.</div><div><br></div><div>What IS required, is that you are passionate about building strong relationships and are a fanatic about meeting expectations and delivering results. You must be self-motivated, show initiative, and not afraid to roll up your sleeves and take care of business. If something needs to get done, get it done!</div><div><br></div><div>DRAW THE OWL!

So make sure you’re up for the challenge!</div><div><br></div><div>We are fairly flexible in terms of work hours. Our clients are exclusively in the United States and Canada.

If you need your social life packaged in a meal-deal with your work, prepare to be underwhelmed.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’re still reading, this might be your dream job. Our dating site users are in need of your TLC. You will send support emails that help them succeed in finding matches, and ensure they don’t have a Kardashian as their profile pic. Repetitive clichés will amuse you. The photos that make you wish iPhones never had cameras will morbidly fascinate, rather than offend.</div><div><br></div><div>If customer service is your passion, perfect! More likely it’s not, but this job will free you to follow it.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll be working up to 40 hours a week with flexibility - our customer support team aims to respond to queries in the shortest time possible between 6am and 8pm EST Monday to Sunday so some weekend work is also involved, but we share the case load so that you don’t step away from the computer wanting to run into the woods never to be seen again.</div><div><br></div><div>Put in the work without someone having to prod you, and you can have a great time. Prove yourself and join the ranks of our core team that has been together for years. Our small team is distributed globally. We get shit done but don’t take ourselves too seriously. We are not a startup and measure success by the apparently-unsexy metric of making more money than we spend. We don’t use words like ‘disrupt’, and implemented our ‘exit strategy’ when we escaped the confines of the 9-5 tedium and commute.</div><div><br></div><div>If you were mildly entertained, or want a job, we would love to hear from you!</div><div><br></div><div>*Candidates from the following countries are invited to apply for this position: UK, Ireland, South Africa, Canada, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and the Netherlands.*</div><div><br></div><div>Submit your best proof of being able to do this work: supportjob@secretbenefits.com&nbsp;</div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more Customer Support jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>AgencyAnalytics</span><br><span>Customer Success Specialist</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>North America Only</span></a></li><li><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Pixellu</span><br><span>Customer Support Rep (Remote &amp; Flexible)</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>Pacific Time</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper. <br />We may be only four years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 40 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact. <br />To strengthen our small team of 23 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as a technically inclined Customer Support Representative. We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount. <br />The successful candidate will be vital in helping Switchee’s userbase. You will be the first point of contact for any resident or installer that has questions about or issues with Switchee. We therefore see this as a crucial role in the company. <br />The role requires initiative and an ability to manage a varied workload whilst under pressure. The successful candidate will be service focused and have a proactive and a can-do attitude combined with excellent communication skills. <br />Main Responsibilities:<br />•    Owning resident communications, both proactive and reactive, from initial contact until resolution.<br />•    Helping installers with basic questions, and liaising with the Ops team for more technical issues.<br />•    Document and improve processes proactively to reduce manual workload <br />•    Manage helpline KPIs and database.<br />•    Regular reporting on case trends and data.<br />•    Support the operations team on collating and writing communication material that is distributed to residents.<br />•    Attending trade fairs /exhibitions, help with event setup and support the team during the show.<br />Switchee is a company built on a strong technical foundation. You will need to triage, problem-solve and communicate effectively with users. We also expect you to work closely with our Product Development team to ensure our product evolves with the customer’s needs at the very centre. <br />Your experience <br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has: <br />•    Experience in B2C telephone support.<br />•    Fluent speaking and writing in English. Other languages are also desirable but not essential.<br />Ideal but not essential:<br />•    Knowledge of heating systems.<br />•    Knowledge of Zendesk or similar ticketing systems.<br />•    Experience in engineering work, mechanical, electrical, network/IT.<br />•    Experience in technical support by phone, email and on-site would be an advantage.<br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br />•    Solutions oriented and proven experience in implementing them.<br />•    Excellent communicator.<br />•    Calm, patient and empathetic.<br />•    Strong teamworker, friendly and helpful person, excellent interpersonal skills. <br />•    Good at delivering and working under pressure.<br />•    Availability to visit residents homes when required. <br />•    You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />•    You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market.<br />•    You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems.<br />•    You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them. <br />•    You are biased towards action and you are happiest when you are ‘getting stuff done’.<br />•    You are open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />•    You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br />Our mission <br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in. <br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it. <br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break. <br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes. <br /><br />Life at Switchee <br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues. <br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location. <br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company. <br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please submit your CV and cover letter letting us know why you would be the best person for the job. <br />Switchee is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status. If you’re smart and good at what you do, come as you are.",

We launched in 2016 with the vision to change lives through transformative healthcare, one community at a time. Since then, we have grown to over 150 clinics across the UK. Our patients love us - we are seeing 20% month-on-month growth and a net promoter score of over 70. The industry also recognises our excellence; we were awarded the highest marks of any health tech company in our CQC (industry body) report.<br /><br />It works like this... patients pre-book an appointment online or walk-in at one of our clinics and sit at a telemedicine station. A doctor joins via video chat and can use the connected diagnostic devices to provide a remote, safe, clinical examination. This means we treat more conditions than online-only doctor services. Any required medication is immediately available at the local pharmacy (most Medicspot clinics are located within pharmacies).<br /><br />Our team is growing rapidly - we are currently 20 people strong. You will work closely with the rest of the Patient Support team (Kyle, Naila, Hayley, Heather and Colin) - you all have the important role of making sure everything runs smoothly. Zubair (our CEO, also a GP, also MBA and serial entrepreneur) heads up the company with fundraising, business development, clinical services, you name it. You then have Adam and Lucas who manage marketing and Oli and his team who build the hardware and software to power the service. We then have a roster of the finest doctors to conduct the consultations and help improve the system.<br /><br /><br /><br />Who are we looking for?<br /><br />Everyone in the team is friendly, supportive and ambitious. We are good at what we do and we have a strong culture of trust and respect. We are looking for an Operations Executive who has amazing customer service skills and a patient-first mindset. You will:<br /><br />-    Be a true team player and be willing to go the extra mile for patients<br />-    Be willing and eager to learn and grow professionally<br />-    Be tech-savvy and computer literate<br />-    Be able to multi-task and prioritise effectively<br />-    Have first-rate customer service skills including great spoken and written communication<br />-    Have heaps of internal motivation<br />-    Want to truly make a difference in the way healthcare is delivered<br />-    Have experience of working in a healthcare setting (preferred not required)<br /><br /><br /><br />What will you be doing?<br /><br />-    Receiving incoming calls from patients and explaining our service<br />-    Liaising with our doctors to ensure that patients’ needs are met<br />-    Be the first line for support for patients through phone, email, and chat<br />-    Communicating with pharmacies to ensure patients are seen quickly<br />-    Administrative support for our marketing team<br /><br />This job can be carried out remotely from your own home or you can work from our Central London office. We are open between 9 am and 9 pm, Monday to Friday, and 9 am to 6 pm on weekends. You may need to cover other shifts while team members are away. Rota details can be discussed at a later stage. No two days will be the same – we can guarantee that.<br /><br />This is a great opportunity for the right candidate to join a rapidly growing company that is revolutionising primary healthcare. <br /><br />No agencies or recruiters for this job advert please – we would like to hear directly from interested candidates.<br /><br />All applicants must be based in the UK.",

Our goal is to create a seamless end-to-end experience, from discovering the perfect item to having it delivered quickly and easily to a place of your choice. Our operations team is critical to this goal, focused on providing our users with an amazing post-purchase experience. We’re looking for an outstanding ops associate with strong administrative skills to help us continue to improve. You will be an important part of this small, dynamic and friendly team. Your role will be fast paced and varied but you’ll execute tasks in a way that makes things seem effortless for our users. If you are highly organised, fast paced, reliable, resilient and keen, this role could be for you. <br /><br /><br />*The role*<br /><br />Your role will be split across two areas of responsibility. Firstly, you’ll be responsible for placing orders with our third party suppliers, making sure that the orders are accurate and sent before the appropriate cut-off time. Secondly, you’ll be the first point of contact for customers with queries about Thread. You’ll either investigate and resolve these queries, or escalate them to a senior team member where appropriate. <br /><br />After initial training sessions in our office in Aldgate, you’ll be able to work remotely most of the time. We might ask you to come to our office occasionally for training sessions. The role guarantees a minimum of 6 hours a week (spread across morning, day and evening shifts on weekdays and weekends), with frequent opportunities to pick up more hours on top of that. We’re happy to negotiate the hours and shift times in line with our requirements. We’re currently particularly keen for someone who has the flexibility to do a shift or two on weekends, if possible!<br /><br /><br />*Your core responsibilities will include...*<br /><br />- First point of contact for our users - field all queries coming through to our support ticketing system and decide on the best pathway for each.<br /><br />- Resolve queries and issues efficiently and to a high standard. Make sure our users come away feeling like they had a mindblowing customer experience.<br /><br />- Contribute towards hitting our support response time and customer satisfaction targets.<br /><br />- Own resolving tickets regarding fulfilment problems, technical issues, feedback and more.<br /><br />- Identify and escalate issues to other teams within the company, including senior ops associates, styling, product and engineering.<br /><br />-Advocate for users internally by passing on their feedback and pain-points to the wider team.<br /><br />- Ensure the smooth running of our “just in time” fulfilment process by placing orders with suppliers in line with cut-off times.<br /><br />- Own hitting our buying cut-off targets, and contribute directly to our shipping time targets.<br /><br /><br />*Are you the one? You are, if you...*<br /><br />- Possess a collaborative “whatever it takes” attitude; be someone who won’t give up until a problem is fixed and who’s not afraid to push and lead others to a resolution.<br /><br />- Excel at finding ways to get around a problem; at times you won’t have the answer you need straight away and will need to think on your feet.<br /><br />- Have superb attention to detail; nothing gets past you.<br /><br />- Constantly think about how we can improve our processes; never be satisfied with a process that isn’t perfect.<br /><br />- Have excellent organisational skills. You make great notes and leave a clear path for others to follow.<br /><br />- Are known for being reliable to your core. Your friends and previous employers would describe you as totally dependable.<br /><br />- Possess exceptional communication skills, being both professional and effective over email.<br /><br />- Are comfortable working across different platforms and channels of communication. You don’t have to be a computer pro, but you’re confident jumping from the support dashboard to the buying page, from your email to a spreadsheet.<br /><br /><br />*Benefits*<br /><br />- This is a flexible role in which you’re welcome to work remotely for most of your hours.<br /><br />- You’ll be working closely with the core ops team and will be involved in the smooth running of our support and buying shifts.<br /><br />- You’ll get first-hand experience of the day to day workings of the operations team in a tech start-up.<br /><br />- Competitive compensation: £10/hour, plus holiday and sick pay.",

We're specifically looking for people who are based in UTC +7 to +12 for this role.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>For the past 6 years, all of our Ghost(Pro) support has been managed by just one (super-hero) support engineer called Sarah. In that time we've grown from nothing, to a paying customer base of 4,000+ companies and 10,000+ different websites and publications, collectively serving half a billion requests each month.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Now, we're growing the support team to spread the workload a little more evenly and have better cover of international timezones. We're adding a lot of new customers each month, and have lots of exciting things in the pipeline - so we hope you'll help us!   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Amazing customer service is one of the most crucial aspects of our business, so you'll be absolutely key in helping us keep new and existing customers happy.   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> *  Help customers via email or chat to ensure they have the best experience possible (we use Help Scout), troubleshooting their problems and answering their questions - which can range from basic billing questions all the way through to advanced DNS configuration and help with editing theme code.   <br>   <br>*  Contribute to internal and external knowledge bases to help customers and fellow team mates understand how to achieve their goals   <br>   <br>*  Work with the Product and Marketing teams to give feedback and represent our customers when identifying bugs, coming up with feature ideas, or prioritising what things we'll build next.   <br>   <br>*  Experiment with tech: this is a startup so things regularly change!   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Ghost is a product aimed at a generally tech-savvy audience of developers and power-users, so the types of support requests we get are typically of a technical nature. That said, we're looking for someone who's comfortable engaging with highly-technical customers, as well as those who aren't technical at all.   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>The ideal candidate would be someone who is...   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Great at empathy. Not everyone has the same skill level, and people often make mistakes no matter how smart they are. We strive to make customers feel empowered and confident based on their interactions with our support.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Fanatic about details. Whether it's all about the grammar, getting the tone just right, or striving to go above and beyond what has been asked by team or the customer — you care about getting it right.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>A creative problem solver. Customer support requests can range widely from remarkably trivial, to incredibly complex. This role is often part concierge and part detective, hunting to get to the root of mystery bugs and issues.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>A great writer. Not only does this role involve a lot of writing, but as a remote team writing is our primary form of communication. Clear, concise communication in native English is an absolute must for this role.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Independent. You'll have quick team meetings each week as well as regular 1:1s with your manager, but beyond that it's up to you to get things done. All teams at Ghost operate autonomously, so you'll be expected to get things done without being directed. A background in contracting or freelancing can be a big help.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Due to the unique needs of support, we do hire with coverage for specific timezones in mind. Generally this means that we count on new teammates to work from the timezone they're hired in. There are always exceptions and flexibilities to this, as long as we can still find a way to serve our customers to the standard that they expect from us. We're happy to chat about your specific circumstances in the interview call, if you have any questions around this.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We value diversity of all types at Ghost and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We have as many people who speak German as we do English and our engineering team contains as many women as it does men. Some of us are single, others are married, while others are parents. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",
