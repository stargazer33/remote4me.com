Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Many of these restaurant chains hire software development teams to create a wide variety of custom applications and websites that integrate with Olo’s APIs. Likewise, the emergence of third party restaurant marketplaces and delivery services has opened new sales channels for restaurant chains, and Olo enables those channels via integrations to our APIs. We also work with a broad array of food delivery providers, POS vendors, and loyalty platform providers who integrate their solutions into the Olo Platform to enable a complete digital ordering experience. Working on Olo’s Developer Support team will give you the opportunity to assist developers from the most innovative and notable tech companies in the food space.   <br>   <br>Olo is transforming the digital ordering landscape for restaurant chains in an ever-evolving ecosystem, and we're looking for a talented engineer and support specialist to join our team in the role of a Developer Support Engineer to help us achieve our vision. You will play a significant and visible role in helping our partners incorporate online ordering into their own applications and solutions. Your primary role will be to provide developer-level support for developers who are integrating to our APIs. You will also be responsible for improving our Developer Portal (where integration partners manage their API projects), API documentation, and associated tools needed to provide an exceptional integration experience.

Many of these restaurant chains hire software development teams to create a wide variety of custom applications and websites that integrate with Olo’s APIs. Likewise, the emergence of third party restaurant marketplaces and delivery services has opened new sales channels for restaurant chains, and Olo enables those channels via integrations to our APIs. We also work with a broad array of food delivery providers, POS vendors, and loyalty platform providers who integrate their solutions into the Olo Platform to enable a complete digital ordering experience. Working on Olo’s Developer Support team will give you the opportunity to assist developers from the most innovative and notable tech companies in the food space.</p><p>Olo is transforming the digital ordering landscape for restaurant chains in an ever-evolving ecosystem, and we're looking for a talented engineer and support specialist to join our team in the role of a Developer Support Engineer to help us achieve our vision.

In this&nbsp;</span><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=gxWPM2LMJ6I' rel='nofollow'>clip</a><span>, board member Stephen Colbert tells the organization’s story.</span></h3></div><div><br></div><div>Since our launch in 2000, more than 3 million “citizen philanthropists” have donated to classroom projects on DonorsChoose.org, channeling books, field trips, technology, and other resources to more than 28 million students in public schools, overwhelmingly from low-income households. Along the way, the organization helped to pioneer the field of crowdfunding and is now making an impact&nbsp;beyond school supplies.</div><div><br></div><div>Through its&nbsp;dedicated team&nbsp;and culture, DonorsChoose.org earned recognition as the #1 “Best Nonprofit to Work For” by the&nbsp;<em>Nonprofit Times.</em></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><b>About the Customer Support Team:</b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>As a branch of the Operations team at DonorsChoose.org, Customer Support is responsible for all one-to-one touchpoints — reactive and proactive — and self-service tools that help teachers, donors, administrators, or any member of the general public successfully use our website.</div><div><br></div><div>As a small and mighty remote team, autonomy and ownership are of the highest value. The quality of our support is a shared responsibility across the team and we all bring ideas to the table to improve our work. We appreciate and take advantage of the time we have to get in sync — one weekly team touchpoint, monthly check-ins with managers, and a vibrant Slack community — but we also deeply value and prioritize our ability to focus on solving customer inquiries.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, we are passionate about serving our customer base — we get to help people bring classroom projects to life and enrich learning experiences! — and believe in support that is kind, personalized, and simple. We go the extra mile when we need to, give people the benefit of the doubt, and take pride in providing engaged and complete support. We get that providing exceptional support to teachers and donors adds value to the DonorsChoose.org mission. We are pretty darn awesome!</div><div><br></div><div><span><b>About the role:</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>As a Customer Support Specialist at DonorsChoose.org, you’ll answer between 50 – 120 emails a day (depending on the day). These inquiries will span a variety of different topics across the entire teacher and donor lifecycles.</div><div><br></div><div>You may help a donor navigate our marketplace to support a school in their hometown. Or you may help a teacher get donations multiplied by qualifying for a partner-backed offer. You may walk a mother through surprising her daughter (a first-year teacher!) by fully funding her classroom project. Or you may spend some time tracking down a shipment of live crickets (yikes!) for a sixth-grade science class. And sometimes you’ll have to do things like explain policies that won’t make the customer super happy, deliver difficult news about eligibility, or simply help a customer reset a password. It’s not all glamor and live insects, but at the end of every day, you’ll have helped a bunch of people bring joy to a bunch of students!</div><div><br></div><div>In addition to this core work, sometimes you’ll —</div><div><br></div><div>Hop on the phone to resolve particularly gnarly issues. (We work primarily in email right now, but sometimes it’s just easier to get on the phone and hash it out!)<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Attend and participate in trainings as scheduled by your team leaders.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Provide feedback to your peers on their tickets and coach newer teammates.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Build documentation to support our work.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Write up bug reports for our Product and Engineering team.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Update or write public-facing help content.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Answer support questions for colleagues across the organization.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div>Lead mini-projects or fact-finding missions — and present ideas or findings to teammates, managers, or others across the organization.</div><div><br></div><div><span>As a successful Customer Support Specialist, you are:</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Professional.</b>&nbsp;You are the face of DonorsChoose.org to many of its customers. As such, you hold yourself to a high standard. You are task-driven, attentive, collaborative, and accountable. Particularly as a remote professional, you can work autonomously and don’t require a ton of supervision.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><b>A solid communicator.</b>&nbsp;It is your job to be clear and concise, to gain agreement on issues, to match tone and be understood by customers who have varied technical experiences and diverse backgrounds. You are a great writer and are not afraid of the phone.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Thoughtful.</b></span>&nbsp;You take pride in your work and care about outcomes. You think “What if I were in this position? What would I want to hear right now?”&nbsp;You foster positive experiences even when it means saying no or sharing difficult or highly-technical information.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Tech comfy.</b></span>&nbsp;You’ll use Zendesk (a ticket management platform), the DonorsChoose.org administrative site, and other third-party applications (Slack, GSuite, and more) in your daily work. You are supporting the use of a two-sided marketplace and want to learn the ins and outs of how it all works. You know basic troubleshooting techniques.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>A learner.</b></span>&nbsp;You recognize that you are always in a position to learn and that you can learn from anyone at any time, including customers. This makes you flexible to change and open to feedback on your work.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Decisive.</b></span>&nbsp;You’ll make judgment calls and decisions based on your knowledge of our policies and processes. You have a bias toward action. You recognize you might make mistakes or occasionally say the wrong thing to a customer, but are confident in your ability to own mistakes and learn from them.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Resourceful.</b></span>&nbsp;Not every question has an easy answer, but you’re totally into figuring things out. You’ve maybe used Nancy Drew as a verb (i.e., “I’m gonna Nancy Drew this.”) and successfully discovered the answer to something tricky. (And you’ll be able to tell us about this in an interview!)<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><b>Generous.</b></span>&nbsp;Once you figure something out, you’re excited to share the new information. You want to lend your ideas to the team and make everyone around you stronger.</div><div><br></div><div>You might also be (not required, but let us know if this is you!):<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><em>A customer support pro.</em>&nbsp;You already have experience providing customer support and genuinely enjoy working with people to solve problems.

This is a hybrid position with responsibilities spanning across both project and account management. We need your help to keep our clients happy, show them the amazing results we’re delivering, and make sure that we fulfill and exceed the promises we make.<br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><h3>What is Crush My Market?</h3></div><div><br></div><div>Crush My Market is a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.crushmymarket.com/growth-agency/' rel='nofollow'>Growth Agency</a>. While marketing agencies focus primarily on brand awareness and top of the funnel activities, as a Growth Agency we understand that ultimately the only thing that matters to our clients is revenue growth.</div><div><br></div><div>We work primarily with high growth SMBs (small to mid-sized businesses) who are committed to expanding their revenue engine by 1) increasing traffic to their website; 2) generate more leads; 3) turning more leads into customers; and 4) improving the lifetime value of their customers.</div><div><br></div><div>Marketing alone just doesn’t cut it anymore.</div><div><br></div><div>Most of our clients are health &amp; wellness businesses committed to helping people get healthier - physically, emotionally, and spiritually. And we love the fact that by helping our clients become more successful and impact more people, we’re doing our part to make the world just a little bit better off.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re a small agency with big growth objectives ourselves. We’ve spent the past couple of years preparing for massive revenue growth NOW!</div><div><br></div><div>You can learn more here:</div><div><br></div><div><a href='https://www.crushmymarket.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.crushmymarket.com</a></div><div><br></div><div><h3>What We're Looking For</h3></div><div><br></div><div>We have tremendously high standards in the work we produce and the results we deliver, and are looking for someone who shares that value and is highly talented in their own right.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’ve worked at a marketing agency, great - that can help. But it’s not required at all.</div><div><br></div><div>If you’ve had training in project management, sure - that’s nice. But, again, not at all required.</div><div><br></div><div>What IS required, is that you are passionate about building strong relationships and are a fanatic about meeting expectations and delivering results. You must be self-motivated, show initiative, and not afraid to roll up your sleeves and take care of business. If something needs to get done, get it done!</div><div><br></div><div>DRAW THE OWL! (<a href='https://www.danielzarick.com/blog/draw-the-owl/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.danielzarick.com/blog/draw-the-owl/</a>)</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll possess an uncanny ability to build rapport with entrepreneurs (our clients) and make sure they are thrilled to be working with Crush My Market. Equally important, you’ll be excited to juggle multiple clients and multiple projects and be an amazing conductor - ensuring everything is working together harmoniously and completed on time.</div><div><br></div><div>We also very much want someone who can grow in this position. We’re growing as an agency and need people to grow with us.

    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper. <br />We may be only four years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 40 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact. <br />To strengthen our small team of 23 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as a technically inclined Customer Support Representative. We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount. <br />The successful candidate will be vital in helping Switchee’s userbase. You will be the first point of contact for any resident or installer that has questions about or issues with Switchee. We therefore see this as a crucial role in the company. <br />The role requires initiative and an ability to manage a varied workload whilst under pressure. The successful candidate will be service focused and have a proactive and a can-do attitude combined with excellent communication skills. <br />Main Responsibilities:<br />•    Owning resident communications, both proactive and reactive, from initial contact until resolution.<br />•    Helping installers with basic questions, and liaising with the Ops team for more technical issues.<br />•    Document and improve processes proactively to reduce manual workload <br />•    Manage helpline KPIs and database.<br />•    Regular reporting on case trends and data.<br />•    Support the operations team on collating and writing communication material that is distributed to residents.<br />•    Attending trade fairs /exhibitions, help with event setup and support the team during the show.<br />Switchee is a company built on a strong technical foundation. You will need to triage, problem-solve and communicate effectively with users. We also expect you to work closely with our Product Development team to ensure our product evolves with the customer’s needs at the very centre. <br />Your experience <br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has: <br />•    Experience in B2C telephone support.<br />•    Fluent speaking and writing in English. Other languages are also desirable but not essential.<br />Ideal but not essential:<br />•    Knowledge of heating systems.<br />•    Knowledge of Zendesk or similar ticketing systems.<br />•    Experience in engineering work, mechanical, electrical, network/IT.<br />•    Experience in technical support by phone, email and on-site would be an advantage.<br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br />•    Solutions oriented and proven experience in implementing them.<br />•    Excellent communicator.<br />•    Calm, patient and empathetic.<br />•    Strong teamworker, friendly and helpful person, excellent interpersonal skills. <br />•    Good at delivering and working under pressure.<br />•    Availability to visit residents homes when required. <br />•    You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />•    You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market.<br />•    You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems.<br />•    You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them. <br />•    You are biased towards action and you are happiest when you are ‘getting stuff done’.<br />•    You are open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />•    You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br />Our mission <br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in. <br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it. <br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break. <br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes. <br /><br />Life at Switchee <br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues. <br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location. <br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company. <br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please submit your CV and cover letter letting us know why you would be the best person for the job. <br />Switchee is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status. If you’re smart and good at what you do, come as you are.",

We launched in 2016 with the vision to change lives through transformative healthcare, one community at a time. Since then, we have grown to over 150 clinics across the UK. Our patients love us - we are seeing 20% month-on-month growth and a net promoter score of over 70. The industry also recognises our excellence; we were awarded the highest marks of any health tech company in our CQC (industry body) report.<br /><br />It works like this... patients pre-book an appointment online or walk-in at one of our clinics and sit at a telemedicine station. A doctor joins via video chat and can use the connected diagnostic devices to provide a remote, safe, clinical examination. This means we treat more conditions than online-only doctor services. Any required medication is immediately available at the local pharmacy (most Medicspot clinics are located within pharmacies).<br /><br />Our team is growing rapidly - we are currently 20 people strong. You will work closely with the rest of the Patient Support team (Kyle, Naila, Hayley, Heather and Colin) - you all have the important role of making sure everything runs smoothly. Zubair (our CEO, also a GP, also MBA and serial entrepreneur) heads up the company with fundraising, business development, clinical services, you name it. You then have Adam and Lucas who manage marketing and Oli and his team who build the hardware and software to power the service. We then have a roster of the finest doctors to conduct the consultations and help improve the system.<br /><br /><br /><br />Who are we looking for?<br /><br />Everyone in the team is friendly, supportive and ambitious. We are good at what we do and we have a strong culture of trust and respect. We are looking for an Operations Executive who has amazing customer service skills and a patient-first mindset. You will:<br /><br />-    Be a true team player and be willing to go the extra mile for patients<br />-    Be willing and eager to learn and grow professionally<br />-    Be tech-savvy and computer literate<br />-    Be able to multi-task and prioritise effectively<br />-    Have first-rate customer service skills including great spoken and written communication<br />-    Have heaps of internal motivation<br />-    Want to truly make a difference in the way healthcare is delivered<br />-    Have experience of working in a healthcare setting (preferred not required)<br /><br /><br /><br />What will you be doing?<br /><br />-    Receiving incoming calls from patients and explaining our service<br />-    Liaising with our doctors to ensure that patients’ needs are met<br />-    Be the first line for support for patients through phone, email, and chat<br />-    Communicating with pharmacies to ensure patients are seen quickly<br />-    Administrative support for our marketing team<br /><br />This job can be carried out remotely from your own home or you can work from our Central London office. We are open between 9 am and 9 pm, Monday to Friday, and 9 am to 6 pm on weekends. You may need to cover other shifts while team members are away. Rota details can be discussed at a later stage. No two days will be the same – we can guarantee that.<br /><br />This is a great opportunity for the right candidate to join a rapidly growing company that is revolutionising primary healthcare. <br /><br />No agencies or recruiters for this job advert please – we would like to hear directly from interested candidates.<br /><br />All applicants must be based in the UK.",

Proficiency is not required.   <br>   <br>* Familiarity with Learning Management Systems.   <br>   <br>* Previous experience in a customer-facing role.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>You will be successful at Hypothesis if you:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Are tenacious, self-directed, and highly motivated   <br>   <br>* Are committed to excellence and improvement   <br>   <br>* Are easy to get along with   <br>   <br>* Have previous remote work experience   <br>   <br>* Have strong time management and communication skills   <br>   <br>* Have strong problem-solving skills   <br>   <br>* Can communicate clearly and effectively with colleagues (especially important in a remote organization)   <br>   <br>* Have an approach to your work that allows for growth and change   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>What’s next   <br>   <br>Does this sound interesting?

    "content": "<span><h2>Support Engineer&nbsp;</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>Ghost</h3></span> <span>Worldwide</span> <span></span> <span>verified</span> <div>  <div>   As the company grows, we’re looking for an additional support engineer to join the team and assist customers using our Ghost(Pro) platform and services, providing coverage for a broader range of timezones across the world. We're specifically looking for people who are based in UTC +7 to +12 for this role.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>For the past 6 years, all of our Ghost(Pro) support has been managed by just one (super-hero) support engineer called Sarah. In that time we've grown from nothing, to a paying customer base of 4,000+ companies and 10,000+ different websites and publications, collectively serving half a billion requests each month.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Now, we're growing the support team to spread the workload a little more evenly and have better cover of international timezones. We're adding a lot of new customers each month, and have lots of exciting things in the pipeline - so we hope you'll help us!   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Amazing customer service is one of the most crucial aspects of our business, so you'll be absolutely key in helping us keep new and existing customers happy.   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> *  Help customers via email or chat to ensure they have the best experience possible (we use Help Scout), troubleshooting their problems and answering their questions - which can range from basic billing questions all the way through to advanced DNS configuration and help with editing theme code.   <br>   <br>*  Contribute to internal and external knowledge bases to help customers and fellow team mates understand how to achieve their goals   <br>   <br>*  Work with the Product and Marketing teams to give feedback and represent our customers when identifying bugs, coming up with feature ideas, or prioritising what things we'll build next.   <br>   <br>*  Experiment with tech: this is a startup so things regularly change!   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Ghost is a product aimed at a generally tech-savvy audience of developers and power-users, so the types of support requests we get are typically of a technical nature. That said, we're looking for someone who's comfortable engaging with highly-technical customers, as well as those who aren't technical at all.   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>The ideal candidate would be someone who is...   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Great at empathy. Not everyone has the same skill level, and people often make mistakes no matter how smart they are. We strive to make customers feel empowered and confident based on their interactions with our support.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Fanatic about details. Whether it's all about the grammar, getting the tone just right, or striving to go above and beyond what has been asked by team or the customer — you care about getting it right.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>A creative problem solver. Customer support requests can range widely from remarkably trivial, to incredibly complex. This role is often part concierge and part detective, hunting to get to the root of mystery bugs and issues.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>A great writer. Not only does this role involve a lot of writing, but as a remote team writing is our primary form of communication. Clear, concise communication in native English is an absolute must for this role.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Independent. You'll have quick team meetings each week as well as regular 1:1s with your manager, but beyond that it's up to you to get things done. All teams at Ghost operate autonomously, so you'll be expected to get things done without being directed. A background in contracting or freelancing can be a big help.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Due to the unique needs of support, we do hire with coverage for specific timezones in mind. Generally this means that we count on new teammates to work from the timezone they're hired in. There are always exceptions and flexibilities to this, as long as we can still find a way to serve our customers to the standard that they expect from us. We're happy to chat about your specific circumstances in the interview call, if you have any questions around this.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We value diversity of all types at Ghost and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We have as many people who speak German as we do English and our engineering team contains as many women as it does men. Some of us are single, others are married, while others are parents. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

Displays interest in digital products, with ideally 1+ years of experience making users happy.   <br>   <br>**How:**&nbsp;You'll have the freedom to define what community &amp; support is at Aula.

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to real time Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. The Elastic family unites employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong>Our Philosophy</strong></p><p>We’re always on the search for amazing people. People who have deep passion for technology and are masters at their craft. We build highly sophisticated distributed systems and we don’t take our technology lightly. In Elasticsearch, you’ll have the opportunity to work in a vibrant young company next to some of the smartest and highly skilled technologists the industry has to offer. We’re looking for great team players, yet we also promote independence and ownership. We’re hackers… but of the good kind. The kind that innovates and creates cutting edge products that eventually translates to a lot of happy, smiling faces.</p><p>Elastic’s Support team is unlike any other on Earth: while we are spread across 12 time zones and 15 countries, we operate as a unit, as a family. We are massively distributed yet lovingly intimate. The service we deliver is caring, empathetic, and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.elastic.co/blog/elastic-support-speaking-code-and-human' rel='nofollow'>human</a>&nbsp;yet bold, direct, and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions' rel='nofollow'>comprehensive</a>. We don’t do it alone, as we are tightly integrated with our core developers in a way that is real, genuine, and never taken for granted. Our team is a dream for someone seeking honest, hard work and rewards. It is a nightmare for anyone afraid to ask questions or be questioned — always forward, never backward.

We’re looking for applicants that are opinionated about what matters to them, and want to join a fun, passionate, close-knit team of high-quality human beings that above all enjoy working together.

This changes how you do things.</li><li><strong>We’re 100% remote</strong>: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.</li><li><strong>We’re all a little weird</strong>: and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars; we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.</li><li><strong>We enjoy the journey</strong>: we’re in this for the long haul.

We’re a funny, humble, talented team of delightful human beings that above all enjoy working with each other, growing with each other, and supporting each other.</p><p><strong>These benefits aren’t that bad either:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Define your work</strong>: find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It’s not about separation, it’s about optimization. Our only rule is an overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST.</li><li><strong>Unlimited Paid Vacation</strong>: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You’ll get required days off for birthdays and knackiversaries.</li><li><strong>Paid Corporate Retreats</strong>: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</li><li><strong>HealthCare</strong>: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</li><li><strong>Equal opportunity</strong>: we push everyone to maximize their impact on our product and company–we strongly value all of our people, regardless of title or seniority.</li><li><strong>Family support</strong>: we offer a generous paid family leave to welcome any new additions to your family.</li><li><strong>Tech</strong>: we provide a top-of-the-line PC or MacBook</li></ul><p><strong>We are also passionate about&nbsp;learning and professional development. We provide multiple learning opportunities and encourage each other to continuously learn and grow:</strong></p><ul><li>Long term&nbsp;<strong>growth and learning plans</strong>, with regular check-ins to help you level up on what’s important to you.</li><li>Have&nbsp;<strong>executive-level visibility</strong>&nbsp;into how the company is run and performing, including revenue.</li><li>Use an&nbsp;<strong>annual allowance</strong>&nbsp;to stay on top of your game with training, classes, conferences, and workshops.</li><li>Get dedicated support from a&nbsp;<strong>marketing mentor</strong>&nbsp;who’ll fast-track your on-boarding and give you the tools you need to be successful.</li></ul><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><p>We believe that different perspectives and backgrounds are what makes a company flourish.

We’re looking for someone with excellent customer support skills, good organizational skills, and a great ability to communicate. Linux, networking, Docker, bash scripting, and general troubleshooting skill are also highly desired.</p><p>Revl makes auto-editing software and smart action cameras. Our customers are sky diving operations, big auto industry players, and zip line operators. What they all have in common is that they want to use our cameras to capture their client’s experiences and then use our software to automatically turn all that footage into a great final edited video that they can sell to their customers. Our auto editing software is fast: a final rendered video is ready less than five minutes after the client has completed the experience! You can see our complete system in action here: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkIW3oBwD2E' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkIW3oBwD2E</a>.</p><p>This position is for our front-line support: the person who answers the phone and responds to emails when customers have issues. From there you’ll need to use your judgement to triage. In some cases you can call the customer and teach them how to fix issues themselves. In other situations you’ll need to connect remotely to their machine and fix issues, or escalate the issue to other engineers. You’ll need to keep the customer informed, coordinate the engineers working to solve the issue, etc. In some instances we’ll create a manual edit for a customer so video editing experience is desirable. When not working on support calls you’ll help test systems prior to deployment and write scripts to automate some manual tasks. Since most of our customers have their highest volume on weekends and issues tend to crop up towards the end of the day working weekends from 11am until 7pm is required.</p><p>We are well funded by several reputable VC’s and Angel Investors including Y Combinator, Comcast Ventures, Frog Design Ventures, Luma Pictures, Bill Tai, and Lars Rasmussen. We offer competitive salary, early equity, and health insurance.</p><p>We are a distributed software team so you can be located anywhere in the USA. Our main office is a beautiful, commuter friendly space in SoMa San Francisco, where we also offer daily catered lunches for all local employees.</p><p>Requirements:<br>• Strong communication and interpersonal skills<br>• Self directed<br>• Attention to detail<br>• Basic Linux skills (bash, ssh)</p><p>Preferred but not necessary:<br>• Video editing experience<br>• Advanced Linux (shell scripts, systemd, networking)<br>• Docker<br>• Programming background in any language<br>• A love of action sports</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/264095?reset=False&amp;ra=1qzihuYCql6E&amp;oqs=a%3D1qzihuYCql6E' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Catered Lunch</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We want you to feel comfortable and excited to apply at Zapier.

You make customers feel empowered after interacting with support and not stupid because of a small mistake.</p><strong>You’re empathetic to users and can easily put yourself in their shoes.</strong><p>&nbsp;Maybe you have a one emoticon and one exclamation point rule of thumb for every email. Maybe it’s only two sentences per paragraph. Either way, you make sure each word and each punctuation mark makes the customer delighted to work with you.</p><strong>You obsess over the details.</strong><p>Every customer is different, many times radically so. You relish being able to meet their specific need, and also solving their problems that may have gone unsaid.</p><strong>You love solving problems.&nbsp;</strong><p>&nbsp;Almost everything at Zapier is done via written communication (both with customers and between teammates).</p><strong>You love to write.</strong><p>Support at Zapier is much different than at many software companies. It’s not the same questions over and over again, and often involves researching technical nuances of the apps we support. You love the opportunity to solve new problems every day and won’t give up when you don’t know the answer right away.</p><strong>You’re persistent.&nbsp;</strong><p>&nbsp;At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.</p><strong>You love doing things efficiently.</strong><p>At Zapier, we have quick team meetings each week and one-on-one meetings every month and then we go make things happen. You get to make things happen without someone saying so.</p><strong>You love to set your own course.&nbsp;</strong><p>For that reason, we only consider candidates who want to dedicate at least the next year or two to giving great support to Zapier customers.</p><strong>We believe giving the best support to our customers is important.&nbsp;</strong><p></p><strong>Things You Might Do</strong><p>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you’ll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you’ll probably do:</p><ul></ul><li>Help customers via email or chat to ensure they have the best experience possible (teammates tend to send 60+ emails every day), troubleshooting their problems and answering their questions.</li><li>Write documentation to help users help themselves (all the documentation on our help site is written and maintained by the support team: https://zapier.com/help/)</li><li>Work with the product team to build tools that will speed up and increase the quality of support at the same time</li><li>Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change</li><p></p><strong>How To Apply</strong><p>We have a non-standard application process. To jump-start the process we ask a few questions we normally would ask at the start of an interview. This helps speed up the process and lets us get to know you a bit better right out of the gate.</p><p>After you apply, you are going to hear back from us, even if we don’t seem like a good fit. In fact, throughout the process, we strive to make sure you never go more than seven days without hearing from us.</p><p></p><strong>About Zapier</strong><p>For the past six years, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job. We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use and love.</p><p>We believe that there are jobs a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs a human is best at doing. We want to empower businesses to create processes and systems that let computers do what they are best at doing and let humans do what they are best at doing.</p><p>We believe that with the right tools, you can have big impact with less hassle.</p><p>We believe in small teams. Small teams are fast and nimble. Small teams mean less bureaucracy and less management and more getting things done.</p><p>We believe in a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment. All teammates at Zapier agree to a.</p><a href='https://zapier.com/jobs/zapier-code-of-conduct/' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;code of conduct</a><p></p><strong>The Whole Package</strong><p>Location: Eastern US and Canada (Eastern / Central Time Zones)</p><p>If you want to work remote, that’s great. If you want to work near others, that’s cool too. Our team of 170+ is distributed because it lets us work with the best people. You don’t have to be located in the USA either. Some team members live in the United Kingdom, Thailand, India, Nigeria, Taiwan, Guatemala, New Zealand, Australia, and more! You just need the skills and drive to succeed in this role and the ability to work from anywhere.</p><p>However, due to the unique needs of support, we do hire with coverage for specific timezones in mind. Generally speaking, this means that we count on new teammates to work from the timezone they’re hired in. As with every rule, there are absolutely exceptions and flexibilities, and advance notice of long-term timezone changes goes a long way! If you have any questions on this at all, we’d be happy to discuss the specifics of your situation during the interview process.</p><p>Compensation:</p><ul></ul><li>Competitive salary (we don’t use remote as an excuse to pay less)</li><li>Great healthcare + dental + vision coverage*</li><li>Retirement plan with 4% company match*</li><li>Profit sharing</li><li>2 annual company retreats to awesome places</li><li>14 weeks paid leave for new parents of biological or adopted children</li><li>Pick your own equipment. We’ll set you up with whatever Apple laptop + monitor combo you want plus any software you need.</li><li>Unlimited vacation policy. Plus we require you to take at least 2 weeks off each year. We see most employees take 4-5 weeks off per year. This isn’t a vague policy where unlimited vacation means no vacation.</li><li>Work with awesome companies around the world.

We are looking for candidates who can learn, troubleshoot and explain the many complex technical systems that make up the Snowplow offering. We expect you to have an analytical mind, a high level of customer empathy and an enthusiasm for improving processes and systems.

You will join the support rotation, and take on an agreed number of evening and weekend support hours (compensated both in money and time). While the ongoing Snowplow Insights support commitment is the first priority, our support engineers will regularly take full days to work on projects that are strategic for the Support team or wider company.<br /><br />Being partly in the European time zone, you will have regular opportunities to interact with the wider company, including at Snowplow’s office in London, our company away-weeks and at our various meetups across Europe.<br /><br />The environment you’ll be working in:<br />Our company values are Transparency, Honesty, Ownership, Inclusivity, Empowerment, Customer-centricity, Growth and Technical Excellence. These aren’t just words we plucked out of thin air, we came up with them together as a company and are continually looking to find new ways to weave these into our day to day operations. From flexible hours and working locations to the way we give feedback, we’re passionate about building a company that supports both company and individual development.<br /><br />We’d love to get to know you if:<br />This role would be a great fit for somebody who has completed an analytically rigorous degree or programming bootcamp, or has experience in programming, QA or other automation<br />You communicate with clarity and empathy<br />You have a broad technical curiosity and proven technical understanding<br />Snowplow customers are highly technology- and data-literate, and expect Snowplow Insights support to be responsive, well-informed and always mindful of their business goals<br />You have a passion for problem solving<br />You will be constantly working with customers and internal Snowplow teams to solve Snowplow Insights problems in as effective, time-efficient and repeatable way as possible - you must love troubleshooting<br />You have a mature attitude to security, documentation and process<br />Snowplow Insights customers trust us with their event pipelines and AWS and GCP accounts - this is a huge responsibility and informs everything we do<br /><br />What you’ll get in return:<br />A competitive package based on experience, including share options<br />25 days of holiday a year (plus bank holidays)<br />MacBook or Dell XPS 13/15<br />Freedom to work wherever suits you best<br />Two fantastic company Away Weeks in a different European city each year (the next one is in May 2019 in Lisbon)<br />Work alongside a supportive and talented team with the opportunity to work on cutting edge technology and challenging problems<br />Grow and develop in a fast-moving, collaborative organisation<br />Enjoy fun events in and around London organised by our Cultural Work Committee<br />Learn to code or improve your existing skills with our Software Development Guild<br />Convenient location in central London (Shoreditch)<br />Continuous supply of Pact coffee and healthy snacks<br /><br /><br />Snowplow is dedicated to building and supporting a brilliant, diverse and hugely inclusive team.

You’ll know it if you’re somewhat of a YNAB wizard already, and you’re known for being helpful, patient, and awesome–particularly when it comes to problem solving and explaining complicated things in a way anyone can understand.</p><p>We&nbsp;<em>love</em>&nbsp;our YNAB customers, and we want to make sure they love their support experience. You’ll look forward to every chat message and email, because it’s an opportunity to help another person gain control of their money and become a better budgeter.</p><p><strong>You’ll work 5-6 hour shifts, five days a week. We would establish a set weekly schedule that works well for both of us.</strong></p><p>That’s a super-brief intro, and there’s a lot more to it. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. (We think you will.)</p><p><strong>*We also have a full-time position available. Apply to&nbsp;<em>the one position</em>&nbsp;that works best for you.</strong></p><p><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></p><p>We build YNAB (or “You Need A Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands), the best budgeting software around. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (Google us, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004, and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our Cultural Manifestohas to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</p><p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB, and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p><p><strong>Emma</strong>&nbsp;is our CS hiring and onboarding manager—which means she has the best job ever. She will walk you through your interviews and training, and help welcome you to the team.</p><p><strong>Senior Support Specialist:&nbsp;</strong>Each support team has a Senior Support Specialist who is a total pro at YNAB support. They’ll be available to answer the many questions you’ll have as you get settled, and will help you become an expert in no time!</p><p><strong>Your Team:</strong>&nbsp;During your first few months, you’ll be a part of a team of other new Support Specialists. You’ll have your own Slack channel, and work together as you navigate your new life at YNAB. After the onboarding period, you’ll transition to your new home team full of experienced specialists and a passionate manager who is eager to help you continue to learn and grow with the team!</p><p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></p><p><strong>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want.</strong>&nbsp;Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Taylor, our CTO, was traveling who-knows-where for a couple of years before he bought a farm. Up and move to France for a year? Sure, Todd did that. Don’t like France? How about London, where Janelle trotted off to. Tulsa Remote? Can do. Or if you just love LA or Baltimore or Buenos Aires, we’ve got people there, too. Not all of us move around, but the fact that these folks have is totally okay, because we’re all adults<strong>. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection and are available for your scheduled shifts.</strong></p><p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></p><p>Just because you can work from anywhere, it doesn’t mean you should—we want you to take vacation. It’s important to get out and do something. We recently rolled out a PTO program for our part-time folks, and we look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong>International is Absolutely Okay</strong></p><p><strong>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. (We are spread all over the world: Switzerland, Scotland, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Germany, Canada, and all over the United States.)</strong></p><p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></p><p>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option—yes, even for part-timers! YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.)</p><p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your Bucket List spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) Good things then follow.</li><li>The bucket list also really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas. No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping people succeed at budgeting with YNAB. You will change lives.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Support Specialist…</strong></p><p><strong>What Success Looks Like:</strong></p><p>At YNAB, our goal is for our users to achieve life-changing financial control. No small thing, right? You’ll join our ever-growing support team and work together to deliver quick, accurate, and friendly responses via email and chat.</p><p>You understand the importance of balancing directness, accuracy, personalization, and speed—and, with time and practice, are comfortable taking on the most difficult conversations.</p><p>You’re incredibly passionate about great customer support. While you may not have an official support background, you understand the role it plays in the success of a business and know the work you do makes a real difference to our users.</p><p>You love problem-solving. You’ll have the impossible task of seeing the forest&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the trees. You’ll dive into the depths of a customer’s issue, infer from their (sometimes vague) descriptions of exactly what’s going on, anticipate where they may get confused next, and clearly explain what they need to do in order to have continued success with YNAB.</p><p>You don’t mind answering the same question multiple times in the same day, because it’s a different customer each time—another chance to make someone’s day. You manage to exceed expectations even when you deliver a different answer than the customer was hoping for.</p><p>You’re really good at switching gears. You’ll answer three emails in a row—one about how to get a reluctant spouse to budget, the next about a bank not pulling in transactions, and another from a college student who realized they really need a budget for all their pizza and ramen—and not miss a beat.</p><p>You know that speed of response is extremely important, but you can walk that fine line between speed and accuracy. You are a master of being direct and friendly within the same sentence, and consistently meet or exceed our team wide metrics. Though you might be a perfectionist, you know when it’s time to ship it.</p><p>You play really nicely with others. You’re flexible. You adapt and adjust. You look forward to getting your QA results because you know it is an opportunity to learn and see someone else’s point of view. And when we ask you to jump in on a project with our design team, or lend your skills to another team member, it’s your best week ever. We’re a team of kind, helpful people and you fit right in.</p><p>You love to learn. You love constructive feedback because it helps you improve. You pick up conversations mid-stream from a colleague who is off for the weekend, and offer a virtual high-five when the conversation is closed: customer satisfied.</p><p>You enjoy taking that one extra step beyond what’s expected. You’re creative in that way. You consistently force us to ask you questions like, “How did you know the customer meant ‘x’, when he was saying ‘y’ the whole time?”</p><p>You’re open-minded. Even if you do have prior support experience, you’re not afraid to learn about how we do things at YNAB, and seeing how our team goes above and beyond what’s expected to deliver exceptionally personalized responses.</p><p><strong>A Day in the Life…</strong></p><p>You always know your schedule, because it’s consistent week after week. Let’s say you work Tuesday through Saturday from 5pm – 10pm UTC (that’s 1pm-6pm Eastern Time). It’s Wednesday, and you’ve opened your laptop to start your shift. You clock in and spend a few minutes catching up on just the important updates since yesterday (there’s a Slack channel for that).</p><p>It’s the first day of the month, so the queue is busier than usual, but expected. To warm up, you take care of any follow-ups that may be lingering since your last shift. A few are from users letting you know your last responses solved their issues perfectly, so your day is off to a great start!</p><p>Then, you head to the back of the queue and pick up a couple of the oldest conversations. You’re often surprised by the complexity of questions you see, but you’re excited for the challenge each one brings. And you know you can skip the ones beyond your knowledge level, after tagging it with your name so you can learn what you didn’t know.</p><p>Once the email queue is in good shape, you check our chat inbox to see what questions you can answer there, all while keeping tabs on any new emails that may come in.</p><p>Today you have your weekly one-to-one with your manager, so you pop in your headphones and hop on a video call to talk about your metrics, goals, and bring up some ideas you have on how we can make the support experience more effortless for our users.</p><p>Before you know it, your shift is over and it’s time to clock out!</p><p><strong>You’re the One We’re Looking For, If:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll be able to send at least 10 replies per hour.</li><li>You could flawlessly juggle two—maybe three—live chat conversations at a time.</li><li><strong>You can commit to a set schedule of 25-30 hours per week, with one 5-6 hour shift on Saturday or Sunday.</strong></li><li>You value excellence and continuous improvement. At the same time.</li><li>You understand how every support response is an expression of the YNAB culture and brand.</li><li>Other people consider you a stellar communicator.</li><li>You love making people happy.</li><li>People thank you when you deliver difficult news. You’re&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;good.</li><li>You enjoy trying things you haven’t ever done before.</li><li>You aren’t afraid to ask questions.</li><li>You are wildly productive and independent, but a team-player at heart.</li><li>You have a laptop or computer for work (a tablet or Chromebook won’t quite cut it for some of the programs we use).</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></p><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li><li>You have experience working remotely.</li><li>You have customer support experience.</li></ul><p><strong>Pay for this role is $16 an hour.</strong></p><p>And, since our job descriptions are already so long, what’s another sentence or two…</p><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p><strong>How to Apply:</strong></p><p>Attach a PDF of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</p><ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.</li><li>Let us know what great customer support means to you, and give an example of a company that you think does support well.</li><li>Give a brief overview of your availability. Include your timezone and if there are any days of the week you’d be unavailable to work.</li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for.</li></ul><p><strong>We currently have both part-time and full-time support specialist positions available.</strong>&nbsp;It is important to us to fill open seats with applicants who truly desire that specific role, so only apply to one of the openings. The full-time position application can be found here.</p><p>P.S. If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who might be, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0jah1/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We’re looking for someone with excellent customer support skills, good organizational skills, and a great ability to communicate. Linux, networking, Docker, bash scripting, and general troubleshooting skill are also highly desired.   <br>   <br>Revl makes auto-editing software and smart action cameras. Our customers are sky diving operations, big auto industry players, and zip line operators. What they all have in common is that they want to use our cameras to capture their client’s experiences and then use our software to automatically turn all that footage into a great final edited video that they can sell to their customers. Our auto editing software is fast: a final rendered video is ready less than five minutes after the client has completed the experience! You can see our complete system in action here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkIW3oBwD2E.   <br>   <br>This position is for our front-line support: the person who answers the phone and responds to emails when customers have issues. From there you’ll need to use your judgement to triage. In some cases you can call the customer and teach them how to fix issues themselves. In other situations you’ll need to connect remotely to their machine and fix issues, or escalate the issue to other engineers. You’ll need to keep the customer informed, coordinate the engineers working to solve the issue, etc. In some instances we’ll create a manual edit for a customer so video editing experience is desirable. When not working on support calls you’ll help test systems prior to deployment and write scripts to automate some manual tasks. Since most of our customers have their highest volume on weekends and issues tend to crop up towards the end of the day working weekends from 11am until 7pm is required.   <br>   <br>We are well funded by several reputable VC’s and Angel Investors including Y Combinator, Comcast Ventures, Frog Design Ventures, Luma Pictures, Bill Tai, and Lars Rasmussen. We offer competitive salary, early equity, and health insurance.   <br>   <br>We are a distributed software team so you can be located anywhere in the USA. Our main office is a beautiful, commuter friendly space in SoMa San Francisco, where we also offer daily catered lunches for all local employees.   <br>   <br>Requirements:   <br>• Strong communication and interpersonal skills   <br>• Self directed   <br>• Attention to detail   <br>• Basic Linux skills (bash, ssh)   <br>   <br>Preferred but not necessary:   <br>• Video editing experience   <br>• Advanced Linux (shell scripts, systemd, networking)   <br>• Docker   <br>• Programming background in any language   <br>• A love of action sports  </div> </div>",

The support that we provide to our customers is a core part of the Snowplow Insights offering, and we strive to provide the best technical support of any analytics vendor. We have implemented a full “follow the sun” support model at Snowplow, with our three support engineers working in three well-distributed time zones (Alberta, Canada; Berlin, Germany; Krasnoyarsk, Russia). We are now looking to hire a support engineer between the EMEA and AMAS timezones, in the UTC -3 to UTC -4 time zone range. We can be slightly flexible around this timezone range, but this is not a role for a candidate working nights. This is a support engineering role - not a support agent role. We are looking for candidates who can learn, troubleshoot and explain the many complex technical systems that make up the Snowplow offering. We expect you to have an analytical mind, a high level of customer empathy and an enthusiasm for improving processes and systems. Depending on where your passions lie, there is a path from Support Engineering at Snowplow into Customer Success, Implementation Services, Tech Ops or Engineering. Responsibilities for our fourth support engineer will include: Handling customer tickets in Zendesk, resolving if possible or escalating further to our Customer Success, Implementation Services, Tech Ops, Engineering or Product teams Handling Snowplow pipeline incidents in OpsGenie, communicating the failure to our customers and either resolving if possible, or working with the customer and/or Snowplow teams to resolve Providing help to the open-source Snowplow community in our Discourse forums Working with customers on regular support tasks including: upgrading their Snowplow pipelines; sharing security best practices; enabling new Snowplow features for their account Creating playbooks, documentation and software to reduce your support workload even as we add more customers Collaborating with Snowplow teams on bug fixes and new features for both our open source projects and our proprietary orchestration and monitoring technology Constant awareness of open and ongoing issues and actively checking and updating open tickets Excellent customer support is at the core of Snowplow’s commercial offering. You will join the support rotation, and take on an agreed number of evening and weekend support hours (compensated both in money and time). While the ongoing Snowplow Insights support commitment is the first priority, our support engineers will regularly take full days to work on projects that are strategic for the Support team or wider company. Being partly in the European time zone, you will have regular opportunities to interact with the wider company, including at Snowplow’s office in London, our company away-weeks and at our various meetups across Europe. The environment you’ll be working in: Our company values are Transparency, Honesty, Ownership, Inclusivity, Empowerment, Customer-centricity, Growth and Technical Excellence. These aren’t just words we plucked out of thin air, we came up with them together as a company and are continually looking to find new ways to weave these into our day to day operations. From flexible hours and working locations to the way we give feedback, we’re passionate about building a company that supports both company and individual development. We’d love to get to know you if: This role would be a great fit for somebody who has completed an analytically rigorous degree or programming bootcamp, or has experience in programming, QA or other automation You communicate with clarity and empathy You have a broad technical curiosity and proven technical understanding Snowplow customers are highly technology- and data-literate, and expect Snowplow Insights support to be responsive, well-informed and always mindful of their business goals You have a passion for problem solving You will be constantly working with customers and internal Snowplow teams to solve Snowplow Insights problems in as effective, time-efficient and repeatable way as possible - you must love troubleshooting You have a mature attitude to security, documentation and process Snowplow Insights customers trust us with their event pipelines and AWS and GCP accounts - this is a huge responsibility and informs everything we do What you’ll get in return: A competitive package based on experience, including share options 25 days of holiday a year (plus bank holidays) MacBook or Dell XPS 13/15 Freedom to work wherever suits you best Two fantastic company Away Weeks in a different European city each year (the next one is in May 2019 in Lisbon) Work alongside a supportive and talented team with the opportunity to work on cutting edge technology and challenging problems Grow and develop in a fast-moving, collaborative organisation Enjoy fun events in and around London organised by our Cultural Work Committee Learn to code or improve your existing skills with our Software Development Guild Convenient location in central London (Shoreditch) Continuous supply of Pact coffee and healthy snacks Snowplow is dedicated to building and supporting a brilliant, diverse and hugely inclusive team.

The support that we provide to our customers is a core part of the Snowplow Insights offering, and we strive to provide the best technical support of any analytics vendor.</p><p>We have implemented a full “follow the sun” support model at Snowplow, with our four support engineers working in three well-distributed time zones (Canada, Spain, Portugal and Russia). We are now looking to hire a support engineer between the EMEA and AMAS timezones, in the UTC -3 to UTC -4 time zone range. We can be slightly flexible around this timezone range, but this is not a role for a candidate working nights.</p><p>This is a support engineering role - not a support agent role. We are looking for candidates who can learn, troubleshoot and explain the many complex technical systems that make up the Snowplow offering. We expect you to have an analytical mind, a high level of customer empathy and an enthusiasm for improving processes and systems. Depending on where your passions lie, there is a path from Support Engineering at Snowplow into Customer Success, Implementation Services, Tech Ops or Engineering.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities for our fifth support engineer will include:</strong></p><ul><li>Handling customer tickets in Zendesk, resolving if possible or escalating further to our Customer Success, Implementation Services, Tech Ops, Engineering or Product teams</li><li>Handling Snowplow pipeline incidents in OpsGenie, communicating the failure to our customers and either resolving if possible, or working with the customer and/or Snowplow teams to resolve</li><li>Providing help to the open-source Snowplow community in our Discourse forums</li><li>Working with customers on regular support tasks including: upgrading their Snowplow pipelines; sharing security best practices; enabling new Snowplow features for their account</li><li>Creating playbooks, documentation and software to reduce your support workload even as we add more customers</li><li>Collaborating with Snowplow teams on bug fixes and new features for both our open source projects and our proprietary orchestration and monitoring technology</li><li>Constant awareness of open and ongoing issues and actively checking and updating open tickets</li></ul><p>Excellent customer support is at the core of Snowplow’s commercial offering. You will join the support rotation, and take on an agreed number of evening and weekend support hours (compensated both in money and time). While the ongoing Snowplow Insights support commitment is the first priority, our support engineers will regularly take full days to work on projects that are strategic for the Support team or wider company.</p><p>Being partly in the European time zone, you will have regular opportunities to interact with the wider company, including at Snowplow’s office in London, our company away-weeks and at our various meetups across Europe.</p><p><strong>The environment you’ll be working in:</strong></p><p>Our company values are Transparency, Honesty, Ownership, Inclusivity, Empowerment, Customer-centricity, Growth and Technical Excellence. These aren’t just words we plucked out of thin air, we came up with them together as a company and are continually looking to find new ways to weave these into our day to day operations. From flexible hours and working locations to the way we give feedback, we’re passionate about building a company that supports both company and individual development.</p><p><strong>We’d love to get to know you if:</strong></p><ul><li>This role would be a great fit for somebody who has completed an analytically rigorous degree or programming bootcamp, or has experience in programming, QA or other automation</li><li>You communicate with clarity and empathy</li><li>You have a broad technical curiosity and proven technical understanding</li><li>Snowplow customers are highly technology- and data-literate, and expect Snowplow Insights support to be responsive, well-informed and always mindful of their business goals</li><li>You have a passion for problem solving</li><li>You will be constantly working with customers and internal Snowplow teams to solve Snowplow Insights problems in as effective, time-efficient and repeatable way as possible - you must love troubleshooting</li><li>You have a mature attitude to security, documentation and process Snowplow Insights customers trust us with their event pipelines and AWS and GCP accounts - this is a huge responsibility and informs everything we do</li></ul><p><strong>What you’ll get in return:</strong></p><ul><li>A competitive package based on experience, including share options 25 days of holiday a year (plus bank holidays)</li><li>MacBook or Dell XPS 13/15 Freedom to work wherever suits you best</li><li>Two fantastic company Away Weeks in a different European city each year (the next one is in May 2019 in Lisbon)</li><li>Work alongside a supportive and talented team with the opportunity to work on cutting edge technology and challenging problems</li><li>Grow and develop in a fast-moving, collaborative organisation</li><li>Enjoy fun events in and around London organised by our Cultural Work Committee</li><li>Learn to code or improve your existing skills with our Software Development Guild</li><li>Convenient location in central London (Shoreditch)</li><li>Continuous supply of Pact coffee and healthy snacks</li></ul><p>Snowplow is dedicated to building and supporting a brilliant, diverse and hugely inclusive team.
