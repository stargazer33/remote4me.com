    "content": "<h3> Customer Success Specialist </h3><div><div><strong>Description</strong><br><br>Hunter is a company founded 5 years ago in France by Antoine and François. Our goal is to make it easier for businesses to connect with each other. We make it happen by continually analyzing public data on the web and making it easy and practical to search.<br><br>We built Hunter to match our needs and aspirations (hopefully, you'll share them too!). We’re fully self-funded and profitable, with the goal of building a healthy long-term business. We have the liberty to exclusively focus on providing the most value possible to our users.<br><br>Maintaining a tight-knit group is essential to us as it creates stronger bonds, increases productivity, and eases communication. We're currently a team of 8 and love it this way. We're in 7 countries (,,,,,,) meaning working remotely is in our DNA. Twice a year, you'll get to meet everyone in person during our company retreats (always in a different place in Europe!).<br><br><strong>The Role</strong><br><br>You'll be joining Giovanni and Juliette in the Customer Success team. This position is essential for Hunter: Even though we keep our product simple, users sometimes need help to get started or better understand how Hunter can help them. The interactions they'll have with you will prove essential to increase retention, convert new people, and maintain a happy user-base.<br><br>Most of the communications with users will happen in writing on Intercom. That's where you'll be resolving tickets daily. Sometimes, you might also jump on a few calls to help with a sale or do customer research.<br><br>We also know that we must continually improve the way we handle Customer Support: This means we have projects that aim to structurally change and improve how we serve our users. Once in the team, based on your skills and interests, you'll take part in those projects.<br><br>Your role also has another critical function: you're the linchpin between users and the rest of the team. Weekly, you'll be sharing feedback, feature requests, and bugs to be fixed. Those interactions with the product team heavily influence the roadmap. You'll be helping us move the service in the right direction.<br><br><strong>Requirements<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>You live in Europe</li><li>You’ve worked at least two years in Customer Support for a SaaS</li><li>You have great communication skills and perfect command of English</li><li>You should be used to working remotely</li></ul><div>Bonus points:</div><ul><li>You have sales skills to be able to convert leads&nbsp;</li><li>You've already worked with APIs or have some development knowledge</li></ul><div><br><strong>Benefits</strong><br><br></div><ul><li>100% remote work</li><li>2 company retreats per year to great destinations</li><li>5 weeks of paid vacation</li><li>$5,000 yearly bonus dedicated to traveling</li><li>A great team  in a sustainable company</li></ul><div><br>If you’re curious to learn more about the hiring process, we wrote a blog post about it. Our About page also contains some useful information.</div></div>",

We’re the folks at SkyVerge, where we build products (like WooCommerce Memberships and Jilt) that help over 100k+ eCommerce brands grow and manage their businesses. Our team is 100% remote, with 35 people distributed all over the world.</p><p>We’re looking for a friendly, talented Customer Support Specialist to join our team and help support our entire suite of products: a suite of WordPress plugins for WooCommerce, and Jilt, an email marketing platform built for eCommerce.</p><p><strong>The Role</strong></p><p>You’ll be the first point of contact for hundreds of thousands of eCommerce stores, helping them with problems, and answering questions. As part of a small team, you’ll likely get your hands dirty with a little bit of everything.</p><p><strong>Here are some things you may do on a given day:</strong></p><ul><li>Assist customers by troubleshooting technical problems and escalating to the engineering team as needed</li><li>Answer pre-sales questions and other feedback from customers</li><li>Document and optimize our support process to improve customer satisfaction</li><li>Write technical documentation and other content so customers can help themselves</li><li>Help our product, engineering, and marketing teams identify areas where we can improve the customer experience</li><li>Monitor social media and forums where customers may have questions or issues with our products and get them the help they need</li></ul><p>With over 70 products that we support, there’s plenty to learn. We’re aiming for you to have broad knowledge (mile-wide, inch-deep) and work closely with the product &amp; engineering team to tackle more technical or in-depth questions that go beyond your knowledge.</p><p><strong>On the first day you will:</strong></p><ul><li>Onboard and get to know your new team members</li><li>Pair with a teammate for training, and answer a few customer questions together</li><li>Have a complete WooCommerce setup with major plugins installed</li><li>Read and review support guide</li></ul><p><strong>In the first week you will:</strong></p><ul><li>Answer customer questions (draft, review from teammate or manager, send)</li><li>Dive into learning WooCommerce and our major products (Memberships, for example)</li><li>Fix a few documentation issues</li></ul><p><strong>In the first month you will:</strong></p><ul><li>Own your own queue</li><li>Answer customer questions with minimal review</li><li>Contribute to documentation as necessary</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>You</strong></p><p>You have that unique combination of technical aptitude and empathy for the user. You’re comfortable with code but prefer to be customer-facing. You’re self-driven with a sense of urgency and draw satisfaction from going above and beyond to provide solutions. You’re an excellent communicator and have the ability to thrive in a distributed environment. Perhaps most importantly, you have a willingness to learn.</p><p><strong>To succeed in this position, you must have:</strong></p><ul><li>A solid understanding of HTML / CSS</li><li>A basic knowledge of PHP, JavaScript, or another programming language</li><li>Native-level fluency in English (Are you fluent in other languages? Tell us! We love being able to support customers in their native language.)</li><li>Outstanding written communication and interpersonal skills</li><li>Boundless curiosity for our products and our customers</li><li>Ability to thrive in a remote environment (along with a reliable internet connection)</li></ul><p><strong>It’s helpful if you have:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience with WordPress</li><li>Experience with WooCommerce (or other eCommerce platforms)</li><li>Experience writing and maintaining documentation</li><li>Experience supporting SaaS products</li><li>Experience supporting downloadable software (especially in the Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP stack)</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><p>Our team is fully-remote and we communicate primarily through Slack, Basecamp, Help Scout, Intercom, GitHub, and weekly stand-ups via Zoom (a few short meetings) — we believe the best work happens when given lots of uninterrupted time that’s free of distractions.</p><p>As a remote team, we believe that regular meetups are invaluable for getting to know each other better, so you should be available for 1-2 company-paid team trips per year.&nbsp;Curious about what those are like? Check out our recap of our last team retreat (SkyTrip), which brought the entire team to a Scottish estate for a week. It’s a plus if you think (like we do) that bears are absolutely the coolest animals in the forest. Want to know more? Read what the team has to say about working with us.</p><p>This is a full-time, salaried position, but hours are flexible. We know your work will speak for itself with thoughtful replies to customers, wiki edits, and published documentation.</p><p><strong>Process</strong></p><p>After an initial screening, you’ll get an email with a few questions to answer. Following that, you’ll interview with Catherine, our Head of People Ops. Next, you’ll complete a short, one-day research project. This helps you get a sense for the kind of things that you’d work on in the position, and helps us learn more about how you think.</p><p>The most qualified candidates will then have a few more ~45 minute phone chats with different people on our team to learn more about you and answer any questions you have about the position and company. Finally, we’ll select a single candidate to be offered a full time position, and then the real fun begins!</p><p><strong>Here are some benefits we’re happy to offer to our team members:</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive salary</li><li>28 days of paid time-off, in addition to 1 company holiday (SkyVerge Day in March)</li><li>Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance for US and Canadian residents and their families (reimbursements for comparable care for non-US/Canadian residents)</li><li>401k/RRSP Retirement plan with 4% company match for US/Canadian residents (contributions to comparable plans for non-US/Canadian residents)</li><li>8 weeks paid parental leave for new mothers and fathers</li><li>Work flexible hours from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection</li><li>Tools (hardware/software) to help you be productive</li><li>Allowance for professional growth (books, courses, conferences)</li><li>Home office or co-working allowance</li><li>A Kindle to help you keep learning</li></ul><p><em>We support workplace diversity and do not discriminate on any protected class. We believe when we work together as a team of different views, experiences, and ideas, we can build amazing things.</em></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://apply.workable.com/skyverge/j/6DBFFC379A/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

You’d fit this role if you have a customer-centric mentality, and would like to help online shoppers have an awesome experience with their purchase.</p><p>Our Customer Experience Specialists work to put a real-life smile on customers’ faces by responding to their questions and concerns through email, chat, and social media. We believe that fast, accurate, comprehensive, and personalized messages make happy and loyal customers!</p><p>At SellerSmile,&nbsp;we work as a virtual team,&nbsp;sharing insights, staying in regular contact through online chat and video conferences. We share feedback, encourage each other to reach personal and professional milestones, and turn mistakes into opportunities for learning. We value clear communication, open-mindedness, enthusiasm, and the ability to anticipate and solve issues.</p><p><strong>You should apply if the following list describes you:</strong></p><ul><li>You’re agile.&nbsp;Change is the only constant in the modern business environment and you respond to that change with calculated speed. You attack problems with constant activity. You do more than most with vigorous persistence and endurance.</li><li>You love smiling.&nbsp;You want to exude the feeling of a smile with every conversation. You’re happy-go-lucky, empathetic, and light-hearted even in the face of negative circumstances. You leave the people that interact with feeling lighter and satisfied.</li><li>You’re mindful.&nbsp;Conscientious, dedicated, attentive, and empathetic. You anticipate customer and client needs and take every opportunity to be helpful. You strive to go the extra mile and reflect on our performance.</li><li>You’re independent.&nbsp;Self-governed, autonomous, and self-sufficient. As a remote professional, you are your own motivator and taskmaster. You don’t wait for others to find solutions and workarounds to barriers. You get to set your own pace without waiting for approval.</li><li>You’re liberated.&nbsp;Free, unrestricted, and flexible, you help our clients and our team members to rise above the “normal” existence where time, resources, and location are limited.</li><li>You’re ethical.&nbsp;You do the right thing even when it’s difficult, which imparts trust. You tell the truth when it’s not flattering or easy. You have a strong internal moral compass that directs us to act in ways that are right and cause the least harm.</li><li>You value empathy.&nbsp;You love to help! You can easily put yourself in a customer’s shoes and feel their anxiety. You realize that not everyone has the same skill set and that smart people sometimes make mistakes. You make customers feel empowered and not stupid because of a small mistake.</li><li>You pay attention to details.&nbsp;Sometimes customers may write emails that are a bit confusing. You pay attention to the finer nuances and context clues to determine what they need. You anticipate future problems and address concerns that may have gone unsaid. You understand the proper tone and language depending on the scenario. Maybe you have a “one emoticon” or “one exclamation point” rule of thumb for every email. You make sure each word and each punctuation mark makes people delighted to work with you.</li><li>You have strong written language skills.&nbsp;Almost everything at SellerSmile is done through text communication (both with customers and within our team). If you’re a user of Grammarly, we are looking for you! (Big plus&nbsp;if you are conversational in any other languages, our entire team is multilingual!).</li></ul><p><strong>Preferred qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Experience in an e-commerce setting.</li><li>Previous work history in customer service (online or brick &amp; mortar).</li><li>Proven ability to work independently. You’ll be communicating with the team primarily via online chat (Slack) and video calls. We understand that a remote lifestyle isn’t for everyone, it takes an advanced level of self-discipline.</li><li>Knowledge of helpdesk software such as Help Scout, Zendesk, Front, Intercom, etc.</li><li>Current use of productivity tools like Slack, Trello, Google Docs, Zoom, etc.</li></ul><p><strong>Things you might do with SellerSmile:</strong></p><p>SellerSmile is a small but fast-growing remote-first company, so you’ll likely get experience on many different projects while you work with our team. That said, here are some things you’ll probably do:</p><ul><li>Help customers through email or chat to ensure they have the best experience possible (teammates tend to send 60+ emails every day), helping research their problems and answering their questions.</li><li>Write documentation to share your knowledge with the team. Everything we create is written and maintained by the Customer Experience Specialists.</li><li>Work with the team to build processes and guidelines that will optimize and increase the quality of support at the same time.</li><li>Experiment: we’re a startup so we like to test new things often!h</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits of working with the SellerSmile team</strong></p><ul><li>100% remote.&nbsp;Work from anywhere with an internet connection!</li><li>Competitive pay.&nbsp;We don’t use remote as an excuse to pay less.</li><li>Flexibility.&nbsp;Take time away when you need it. Balance your business, pleasure, and personal lives!</li><li>Happy birthday.&nbsp;Mandatory holiday on your special day!</li><li>Results only.&nbsp;We care about getting the job done, not bureaucracy.</li><li>Fun. Work alongside a light-hearted but determined team.</li><li>Bonus $.&nbsp;Upgrade your home office + internet.</li><li>Growth.&nbsp;Join a profitable &amp; growing company.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.sellersmile.com/join-our-team/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

    "content": "<h3> Remote Sales and Customer Champion </h3><div><div>Greenback Expat Tax Services is a company that specializes in preparing tax returns for Americans living overseas. We are a highly energetic, positive, resourceful team working virtually across the globe. We believe that executional excellence is key to success. We are currently seeking a talented, passionate, enthusiastic <strong>Sales and Customer Champion </strong>to join our team<strong>. </strong>As a business, our DNA and core is about excellence in customer experience plus we’re in a big period of growth for the business, so we see this role as one of the most integral ones on our team.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The role has two critical and interrelated, but distinct responsibilities. You need to be passionate, experienced and talented at both.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Customer Care:<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</div><div>We call this role a “customer champion” for a reason- your role is to be the customer advocate and champion for our business. Good customer service seeks to understand a customer’s situation and help them resolve that situation at the first point of contact. Great customer service seeks to resolve that customer’s need, and translate that need back to the business to ensure that we improve- sometimes in tiny ways- and avoid any customer having a similar confusion moving forward.<em> Incredible customer service</em> does not just that, but seeks to listen to what’s not being said, read between the lines and take that back to make the experience better- for that customer and every one after that one. We believe our customers deserve incredible customer care. So, if you do too, and you love to help people, can’t stand the idea of anyone ever being confused or have anything other than a surprisingly delightful experience working with us, we’d love for you to apply.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Sales:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In the same way that we care deeply about customer experience, we also understand that in order to win that business, we need to earn the trust of prospective customers. That’s not easy (nor should it be!). We know that when someone starts the process of engaging a tax preparer, they may feel anxious, they may feel frustrated, and they may dread the process. Taxes aren’t at the top of their list, and they need us to make it easy for them, but also make them feel confident that we are in control of their tax needs. The right sales person doesn’t just answer a question, but help to really explain and articulate what makes Greenback special and why we’re a great fit compared to other alternatives. The right sales person can speak intelligently about taxes, about how we work, about the strength of our accountant team and do so in a genuine, not pushy way. Timeliness, appropriate feedback, good knowledge of the industry as well as our internal process are all critical to the role.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Last- but certainly not least- we’re looking for someone who’s a great fit for our company culture. We’re a small, tight knit team- all of us working remotely from home offices. We’re growing fast (check us out on the INC 5000 list- whoohoo!). We’re obsessive about customer experience, believe that planning is the key to success, and like to work hard and make things happen- but also live our lives outside of the (home) office too! We’re looking for someone who is confident, reliable, an excellent communicator, loves working in a fast-paced team, and is able to get things done with minimal supervision (we don’t like looking over your shoulder- and don’t think you’d like that either).&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Key skills needed:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>Excellent communication skills (does that go without saying?). You will mostly be speaking with people via email (80%), with some phone calls (20%). You need to be able to read between the lines and craft messaging that is warm, friendly, professional and really meets the need of the specific demands of that email interaction.&nbsp;</li><li>The ability to convert warm leads at a high volume by setting proper expectations, providing thoughtful responses, and clearly outlining next steps.&nbsp;</li><li>Ability to identify opportunities to add value by monitoring industry changes, trends and customer needs.&nbsp;</li><li>Use analytics to manage and measure your success, know where to put additional effort, and prioritize. That means you need to be someone who can manage to targets, metrics, and can analyze these metrics, understand what they mean, and make good decisions as a result.&nbsp;</li><li>Excellence in execution: Attention to detail and ability to keep organized/juggle multiple things at once. We're a seasonal business, so there are times when our inboxes are on fire! This is part of the role, and being organized, handling stress well and being able to juggle high demand situations comes with the territory.&nbsp;</li><li>We don’t expect you to be an accountant, but you will need to learn and become a subject matter expert on US expat taxes.&nbsp;</li><li>Bonus: current or former expat, or someone who appreciates or gets excited about the expat life.&nbsp;</li><li>Time zone: we’re looking for someone who is in a fixed time zone +/- 2 hours from GMT. We’re not looking for long term travelers/people who aren’t in the same time zone most of the year.&nbsp;</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div>What we offer:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>The opportunity for you to work with highly talented, communicative, make-it-happen people who also love adventure.</li><li>&nbsp;Very generous time off policy.&nbsp;</li><li>4 weeks of Paid Parental Leave at 100% of your salary!&nbsp;</li><li>We have an excellent benefits package that includes a 401k plan (with company match), medical, vision, and dental coverage (We pay 75% of your premium) and short-term disability (We cover 100% of the cost)!&nbsp;</li><li>Annual team trip (this year: San Diego, last year: Playa del Carmen, Mexico)&nbsp;</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Apply today!!! To apply, please visit:&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We ONLY accept applications via our website here: https://www.greenbacktaxservices.com/jobs/remote-sales-and-customer-champion/&nbsp;</div></div>",

We are building the data exchange platform, backed by a network of hundreds of health systems and thousands of app developers, that provides consistent, easy access to the developers building the next generation of healthcare technology.</p><p>By eliminating access to healthcare data as a barrier to entry, we are enabling the technical innovation that will allow healthcare providers to better care for patients and for patients to better control their health.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Transparent Communication- Regular All Team Meetings</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work - work anywhere in the US!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Open Source languages</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Open PTO - Flexible time off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance Day 1</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k Day 1</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Parental Leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Productivity Stipend</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

If you’ve never been in some sort of personal development program where coaching played a part (either you being the coach or being coached by someone else), you will not be considered (sorry!).&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Structure of the role<br></strong><br>The customer support role is split, more or less, into three thirds:<br><br></div><div>The first third is fielding customer support issues as they come in. Generally via email, though sometimes we take the initiative to call and knock it out over the phone (in our business, customers are often really stoked to hear from a real person!).</div><div><br>The second third is making ourselves available for demos, help sessions, consultations (affectionately referred to as hand holding sessions, these are where we get to shine by letting our customers get to talk to and be guided by A REAL PERSON).</div><div><br>The third third is where we have time and bandwidth to do things above and beyond just reacting to incoming needs and requests. This is when we do outreach to our customers (affectionately dubbed “doling out customer love”), improve and expand our learning resources (like writing articles and making help videos), and take on other sorts of projects to further our mission to serve coaches.</div><div><br>Each of these thirds affords opportunities to shine and excel, and gives a lot of variety from day to day plus opportunities to learn. The third third in particular is ripe for you to bring your creativity and have your voice heard to make lasting contributions.</div><div><br><strong><br>Structure of the position<br></strong><br></div><div>The position is full-time, 40-45 hours per week during business hours in North America. On average about 2 of these hours per week will be over the weekend to cover incoming support issues. The position is remote, though may occasionally require commuting for in-person demos and meet ups, and several times a year entails travel for conferences and in-person work with the team (er, when things settle down with this whole COVID-19 thing, ahem!). You must be a US resident.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Compensation and Benefits</strong><br><br></div><div>Because our team is so small, it is vitally important for us to find the right fit in adding number three. Therefore the first two months is a test period during which you’ll be an hourly contractor earning $30/hour. You can start full time to begin or we can be flexible to allow you to ramp up as needed to assist with your transition.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>After two months if we agree this is a Good Thing™, congratulations! That’s what we’re going for and you will then be offered a full-time salaried position starting at $60,000 per year. As a salaried employee vacation benefits apply: holidays plus THREE weeks off per year. Your discretionary paid time off is earned pro rata as you go starting from your official employment hire date.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>After two months as a salaried employee, the following additional benefits kick in:&nbsp;</div><ul><li>$100 monthly fitness allowance ($1200 per year)</li><li>$500 per year continuing education allowance (to learn ANYTHING you want, doesn’t need to be job related; we know that curious and happy employees are the best kind)</li><li>$50 monthly internet/phone allowance ($600 per year)</li><li>QSEHRA health insurance premium reimbursement benefit of up to $5,150 per year for self-only employees ($429.17 per month) and $10,450 per year for employees with a family ($870.83 per month)</li><li>SIMPLE IRA 100% match of up to 3% of salary (3% of $60,000 is $1800)</li></ul><div><br>Cash value of these benefits maxed out: $1200 + $500 + $600 + $5150 + $1800 = <strong>$9250<br></strong><br></div><div>Total compensation adds up to <strong>$69,250 + 3 weeks paid vacation</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Requirements and Applying<br></strong><br>Again, you need to have some sort of coaching experience to be considered. <strong>Please do not apply if you don’t have that.</strong></div><div><br>Have that sort of background?

    "content": "<span></span> <span><h4>Johns Hopkins University </h4>&nbsp;</span> <br> <h3>Associate Director, Hire Hopkins</h3> <span></span> <br> <span>Worldwide</span> <div>  <div>   Associate Director, Hire Hopkins\\n\\nGeneral Summary/Purpose:\\n\\nHire Hopkins, one of three new innovation offices at Johns Hopkins University is a remote-first, newly launched, start-up department. We're focused on developing relationships with employers from a wide variety of industries to enhance job recruitment opportunities for students at all nine academic divisions of the university. Our purpose is to lead and streamline the interactions major employers have with the university to ensure that neither side misses an opportunity to connect a talented and qualified student with a potential job. We support Hopkins grads and post-doctorate fellows towards getting multiple offers for jobs they're excited about.\\n\\nTo provide some context about this office, Johns Hopkins University has developed an ambitious vision to continue to integrate life design, experiential learning, and mentoring in the academic and co-curricular learning experience for all students and postdoctoral fellows. Under the leadership of Dr. Farouk Dey, the inaugural vice provost for integrative learning and life design, the university has announced the creation of three new departments and several new initiatives and mission that will ensure that every student and postdoctoral fellow will have the ability to pursue life purpose regardless of background, field of study, or social capital. Read more about this plan here.\\n\\nThis new vision is focused on scalability of resources and services. For this transformation to work, traditional one-on-one counseling and coaching services are taking a backseat to a culture of scalable programs and interventions. Those who thrive as counselors, advisors, and coaches and do not enjoy the intense focus on scalability and metrics may not be the best fit for this organization.\\n\\nAbout the role:\\n\\nReporting to the Executive Director of Hire Hopkins, the Associate Director of Hire Hopkins will assist in building relationships with companies for the benefit of all students, postdoctoral fellows, and alumni at Johns Hopkins University. The Associate Director will work to attract top employers who can work with multiple schools across the university and grow employer representation at all divisions and departments. They will work closely with the Executive Director to collaborate with leadership across the university, career centers, Johns Hopkins Tech Ventures (JHTV), DAR, and Corporate Relations to implement institution-wide programs that help university staff to best engage employers and ultimately, recruit talent for internships and employment. At its core, this is a highly collaborative and strategic position that will require coordinating business development, meetings, phone calls, training and follow-up actions among employers, career centers, and schools.\\n\\nBecause Hire Hopkins is a “start-up” office, the Associate Director will also need to be able to help the Executive Director successfully launch Hire Hopkins within a decentralized university by offering operational support, which can vary from marketing &amp; communications, to learning &amp; development.\\n\\nThis is a great opportunity for someone with a proven track-record in employer development, recruiting, business development, and/or sales who would also enjoy supporting operationally and doing whatever is needed to make things work. This is a “start-up” type operation with the perks of a larger organization's resources.\\n\\nSpecific Duties &amp; Responsibilities:\\n\\n• Develop strategies for targeting decision-makers at companies in order to book meeting pitches.\\n• Lead outbound outreach (cold calls, sending emails, and leading high-level discovery calls) with companies who can work with and hire Johns Hopkins graduates and post-doctorate fellows.\\n• Drive hiring partner pipeline through setting up qualified meetings with top employers.\\n• Identify potential hiring partners and act as a front door for those partners into Hopkins.\\n• Initiate and coordinate partner engagement including site visits or alternative options to explore opportunities for future or expanded collaboration.\\n• Take a leadership role in coordinating all aspects of deal negotiation and oversee hiring partnerships from identification through closure stage. Attention to detail and proper follow up is critical.\\n• Conduct market research and forecast hiring trends of top employers.\\n• Collaborate with colleagues across divisions and units, especially Johns Hopkins Tech Ventures (JHTV), Corporate Relations, Development &amp; Alumni relations, and the career centers to ensure a unified approach. Maintain and continue to build relationships within the university to create a culture of trust and collaboration.\\n• Be a subject matter expert on Johns Hopkins University's various schools, departments, and students, what they bring to the table, and how they compare to other talent pools.\\n• Report weekly to the Executive Director on market intelligence gained, business development activity and success.\\n• Use Salesforce and other relevant tech tools to track actions, metrics, and results.\\n• Manage ongoing relationships with partners at a high level, and work with employer engagement staff members to communicate reporting milestones and other progress.\\n• Support engagement in social media, digital outlets, and academic and professional journals and associations to establish Hire Hopkins as an exciting brand, tell the story, and serve as a thought leader at Johns Hopkins University, industry, and in higher education.\\n• Willingness and ability to travel up to 25-30%.\\n\\nThe Ideal Candidate:\\n\\nThe ideal candidate is entrepreneurial, data and outcomes driven, strong in planning and execution, comfortable leading programs and interventions with groups, and enjoys developing relationships and connections with multiple stakeholders at once. They must be transparent, open-minded, creative and committed to working and unifying members in a heavily decentralized institution. Also, the ability to resolve complex problems while maintaining a sense of humor and a solution-oriented, positive attitude is critical.\\n\\nWe have modernized our approach and expect that our teams can work from anywhere for the purpose of scaling our impact across the institution. For this model to work, the ideal candidate must present excellent skills in relationship development, being self-driven, and engaging audiences in groups digitally. The ideal candidate has experience working remotely and is comfortable with co-working and flexible work arrangements. We expect the ideal candidate to be available during the Eastern time zone and comfortable working from a home office or co-working space. We will provide a laptop, cellphone, and co-working stipend if need be.\\n\\nA big plus if they are an effective user of tech tools, social media, and other digital outlets to engage multiple audiences, strengthen individual and organizational brand, scale impact, and influence public opinion.\\n\\nMinimum Qualifications:\\n\\n• Bachelor's degree required.\\n• Three (3) years recent direct experience in business development, sales, HR consulting, or recruiting with large-scale organizations.\\n• Proven track-record of having successfully executed business development and negotiated partnerships.\\n\\nPreferred Qualifications:\\n\\n• 2+ years operational experience in start-up, small business, or decentralized higher ed environments.\\n• Professional experience in marketing, communications, branding, and/or social media.\\n• Experience in college recruiting.\\n\\nSpecial Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities:\\n\\n• Must have a mastery of best practice in prospecting, sales, recruiting and business development.\\n• Excellent oral, written and interpersonal skills. Great listener, strong presenter, and a highly professional image with the ability to interact with people at all levels (from staff members to C-suite executives). You're comfortable both drafting a memo and making a 20 minute presentation to an audience.\\n• Strong problem solving, negotiation and persuasion skills. You're able to get buy-in by connecting with what employers need.\\n• Enthusiasm for the clarity that metrics bring. An obsession for clearly tracking and measuring results.\\n• Must be able to demonstrate effective time management skills and the ability to work independently with minimal day-to-day supervision, while delivering on-target results.\\n• Extremely organized and takes an analytical approach to solving any kind of problem. Brings clarity to complex situations and is able to be solution-oriented and positive under pressure.\\n• Record of success in securing large deals and/or partnerships.\\n• Comfortable working within a complex, multi-divisional environment to establish priorities, set objectives and achieve stated goals.\\n• Demonstrated motivational and consensus-building skills.\\n• Commitment to the use of information technology and the management of database systems.\\n\\nClassified Title: Business Program Manager\\nWorking Title: Associate Director, Hire Hopkins \\nRole/Level/Range: ATP/04/PD\\nStarting Salary Range: Commensurate with Experience\\nEmployee group: Full Time\\nSchedule: Mon-Fri 8:30-5\\nExempt Status: Exempt\\nLocation: 01-MD:Homewood Campus\\nDepartment name: 60009252-Integrative Learning and Life Design\\nPersonnel area: Homewood Student Affairs\\n\\nThe successful candidate(s) for this position will be subject to a pre-employment background check.\\n\\nIf you are interested in applying for employment with The Johns Hopkins University and require special assistance or accommodation during any part of the pre-employment process, please contact the HR Business Services Office at mailto:   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span> For TTY users, call via Maryland Relay or dial 711.\\n\\nThe following additional provisions may apply depending on which campus you will work.
