Emulating the models of Netflix and Goodreads we're building robust discovery mechanisms, data-driven recommendations, and next-generation tools to engage with theatre and other live performing arts. We are in week three of the public beta of our MVP, have had over 2500 visitors and feedback is positive from users and the industry. Exciting times.&nbsp;Thespie is a disruptive model in our space, so speed is essential - but unrealistic timelines, angst and blame are not part of the equation. We're heads down on building and moving fast because we love what we do, and have big things we need to deliver for theatre-goers.</p><p>You:</p><p>We are looking for a Data Scientist to join us on a project basis (ideally full-time for a handful of weeks) to design and implement a Content-Based Filtering (CBF) algorithm. If time allows we'd also welcome advise on a few other data-related projects, and will in future want to implement a deeper (probably UBCF) recommendation algorithm when we've got loads of user data. We are mostly Python/Django on the backend, infrastructure is nearly all AWS and we use Segment and Redshift for analytics. At this stage we aren't looking to reinvent recommendations or win awards, just get a robust, clean, error-free solution in place for users. So looking for deep experience in quickly implementing straightforward data solutions. We can pay hourly or per project quote.</p><p>Us:</p><p>We're a pretty focused and skilled bunch (ex-Amazon, Zipcar, Fintech, BBC, etc.), based in London and Boston. So you hopefully won't have to waste too much of your time getting us up to speed on your recommended solutions. We love feedback and collaboration and have lots of exciting problems to solve, so would love to find someone that cares about our mission: to remove barriers-to-entry for potential theatre-goers and be the most trusted way to access theatre.&nbsp;We're based in London's South Bank and can provide weekday access to our somewhat unique co-working space :), or we're open to remote as well provided you are an excellent communicator and Slack collaborator.</p><p>If the above sounds like you - or you're excited about what we're doing, please apply and/or connect! We love meeting new people interested in the problems we're solving.</p>",

Launched in the U.K. in December 2018, CoGo wants to transform every pound that U.K. consumers spend into a vote for a better future. The platform is the first tech innovation that has the aim of leveraging spending data and every transaction made by a consumer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>We are the UK&rsquo;s national aggregator of data on accredited businesses and we are using this data, in conjunction with <a href='https://www.openbanking.org.uk/'>Open Banking</a>, to build a platform that can tell our users what percentage of their spending is with businesses that align with their values. This enables our core value proposition: a recommendation engine that helps our users shift more of their spending to ethical and sustainable businesses.</p><br /><h1><strong>ABOUT YOU:&nbsp;</strong></h1><br /><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>You are passionate about the power of data to change the world. You have an analytical mind par excellence, and the breadth of experience and comprehension to grasp the vision whilst grappling with the detail. Your data science is as much a product of your statistical background as it is your technical background. You relish the opportunity to take on new challenges, you can work independently, and you are well connected in the data science community. Ethical data science is your default mode.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>You will get a real kick out of working on models that interact directly with the real world. This is an opportunity to be the brain behind the core feature of an innovative, world-first, user-facing app, at the forefront of ethical consumer tech. You will be itching to get your prototypes in front of users and constantly iterate and test your work.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>CoGo is a values-driven business, and it&rsquo;s our commitment to a better future that drives each and every one of us. You&rsquo;ll love working with us if you care about people and the planet, and believe in the power of data, technology and consumer demand to bring about meaningful change.</p><br /><h1><strong>THE ROLE&nbsp;</strong></h1><br /><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>The data scientist role will be focussed on developing this recommendation engine, starting by prototyping and user testing, then progress towards more sophisticated data models.

    "content": "<p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>About the company</strong></p><br /><p>LandInsight is a new platform that is fundamentally changing how the property industry buys land for development. It&rsquo;s a big data platform that speeds up the process of finding, assessing and buying land. It comes at an important time, one of the biggest challenges for the UK housing crisis is tackling the shortage of development land. Our tech has changed the game and as a result we&rsquo;ve become the UK&rsquo;s fastest growing PropTech company (and we&rsquo;ve got the awards to prove it!).</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>Our culture</strong></p><br /><p>We live and breath our values of &lsquo;open&rsquo;, &lsquo;empower&rsquo; and &lsquo;home&rsquo;, they are in the footprints of all we do and who we are.</p><br /><p>We truly believe that businesses flourish when people are empowered to work collaboratively and harmoniously. That&rsquo;s why we prioritise team building, high engagement and knowledge sharing in every thread of company. Sitting in our open plan offices means not only knowing the founders, but also learning about the conception and scale of a startup.</p><br /><p>We don&rsquo;t just make empty gestures about our culture - we were voted as the 3rd best UK SaaS Company to work at, and have also received awards for &lsquo;Best at Employee Development&rsquo;.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check out our tech blog <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Ftech-blog.landinsight.io%2F' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>here</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>Your mission </strong></p><br /><p>At the heart of our product is open data, which we pull in from a wide range of sources. Our customers expect the data to be up to date, accurate, and intelligently integrated into our platform.</p><br /><p>The datasets typically contain 1-30 million items. In some cases this is nice and clean at the point we receive it, but in other cases we have to use a combination of machine-learning and hand-crafted algorithms to extract metadata from plain text or pdfs. Also, since most of our data is geospatial, we focus a lot on geocoding data accurately and joining across geospatial datasets.</p><br /><p>In this role, you will first need to assess the infrastructure we currently have, as built by our full-stack engineers. You will then plan how to migrate towards a more robust system, this includes building tools and processes that will empower our remote contractors to keep a check on, and maintain, parts of the system (e.g. scrapers). Importantly, the new system will need to be flexible as we add new datasets and squeeze more meaning from existing datasets.</p><br /><p>A second aspect of the role will be working with geospatial data generated by our users. This part of the business is more in its infancy, but we have grand ambitions for it and would want you to aid in the decision making, even if not working on the implementation yourself.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>Key Responsibilities</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Developing (improving existing and/or creating new) interfaces and/or pipelines to facilitate data collection.</li><br /><li>Identifying, debugging and fixing issues. This includes liaising with other technical/non-technical staff.</li><br /><li>Working closely with remote colleagues (technical and non-technical) who also work on data projects</li><br /><li>Improving our algorithms that derive data from the incoming datasets.</li><br /><li>Educating our full-stack engineers to be better data engineers.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>You are highly competent in one or more programming languages (5+ years experience)</li><br /><li>You are able to reason about the behaviour of systems before starting to build them</li><br /><li>You have built a variety of data processing/management systems</li><br /><li>You have experience with various data visualisation and business intelligence systems</li><br /><li>You are a clear communicator in both written and verbal forms</li><br /><li>AWS is desirable</li><br /><li>NodeJS (or simply JavaScript) is desirable</li><br /><li>MongoDB is desirable</li><br /><li>Postgres is desirable</li><br /><li>Elasticsearch is desirable</li><br /><li>Geographical Information Systems is desirable</li><br /><li>ScrapingHub is desirable</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Flexible working hours</li><br /><li>Professional and personal training budget</li><br /><li>Competitive salary and equity options</li><br /><li>25 days paid holiday (additional to bank holidays)</li><br /><li>Unlimited unpaid holidays</li><br /><li>Dog friendly office</li><br /><li>Loads of social events, including a quarterly away day, an annual ski trip and monthly socials</li><br /><li>Gym and wellness contributions, and a cycle to work scheme</li><br /><li>Dedication to hiring for cultural fit, so you know you&rsquo;re going to be sitting next to someone who you want to grab a beer/glass of prosecco with (usually at the free WeWork bar we have available after 2pm every day!</li><br /></ul>",

Come join us! You'll get to shape the future direction of the pipeline and the travel API, working on adding new features and more smart analysis.</p><p>Our pipeline is implemented in python, using a mapreduce framework. The API is implemented using Django, deployed to AWS using Docker containers and serving data out of a postgres database.</p><p><strong>The role</strong></p><p>This is not an ordinary development job. Candidates must be comfortable designing, implementing and maintaining complex algorithms.&nbsp;We're looking for smart, talented developers who are willing to learn whatever it takes to get the job done.

This is the new travel: bookings on the go, the best selections, immediate skip-the-line access to venues and events, bespoke experiences and local knowledge – the right tools delivering useful information in the simplest way. We launched in Milan in 2013 and have since taken root in 70 different countries. Right now, our offer extends to 450 cities, thousands of potential things to do and see, and availability in eight languages – making us a leading guide for international travel activities. Our traveler-friendly technology has been featured in such international publications as Wired, TechCrunch, Daily Telegraph, Bloomberg, Corriere della Sera and Times of India. We’ve been selected by Apple as ‘Best of 2014’ in European App Stores and again in 2016 as one of its ‘Best Apps to Start 2016.’ In October 2017 we acquired the travel content platform Triposo, bringing together more than 12 million travelers across both platforms and offering them hyper-personalized travel content and booking options. In December 2017 we were awarded with the Great Place To Work Italia Certification. We were successfully ranked in the Top 20 Best Workplaces in Italy (Medium size companies category).</p>            </div>        ",

    "content": "<div><br /><h2>The role</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><p>We are looking for a talented senior engineer to join our small-but-growing company at an exciting time for the tech team.</p><br /><p>Started in 2012, CV Partner was initially built by the founder using all the coolest technology for that time: Rails, CoffeeScript and Mongo. A couple of years later a React frontend was added and this stack enabled us to remain agile while we discovered our clients' needs and quickly build the functionality they were seeking. We ended up creating a tool that they enjoy using and has a measurable improvement in their productivity and ability to win bids.</p><br /><p>Now, 7 years on, with a bigger team, many features added, larger clients signed and much more data being processed we're finding the limitations of the current architecture. Some tech debt has accumulated and it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult to keep the ever-expanding Rails app up to date with the latest versions and add new features in a timely manner. Also, we're slightly embarrassed to still be using CoffeeScript in 2019.</p><br /><p>So, we've started to put in place some infrastructure that will help us transition to building microservices. We've begun work on an event-source based architecture with plans to utilise the CQRS pattern. We&rsquo;ve already built some of the main building blocks in Rust and are starting to flesh out how some of the trickier aspects will work (e.g. auth, shared frontend components etc).</p><br /><p>The team is currently comprised of all senior-level people, including two software engineers, a DevOps and a UX designer. The founder also still codes occasionally as we haven't built up the courage to revoke his git access yet.</p><br /><p>You'll help put in place the foundations of the technology and engineering practices that can provide a platform for the company to meet the needs of our clients over the coming years. That means deciding on programming languages, tools and services to help build robust, fast and secure software. We're looking at things such as TypeScript, Vue and GraphQL/AppSync but nothing is set in stone and we value using the best tool for the job.</p><br /><p>The next phase of growth will be to start bringing mid-level or junior engineers into the team, so you should be happy mentoring those with less experience and when the time comes, we'd value your input into the hiring process.</p><br /><p>We're pretty laid-back when it comes to flexible working so you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to spend some time working from home or a co-working space close to home if you have a long commute. As a company, we are distributed across three countries already so most comms are through slack or video call. However, we do value face-to-face communication as not even the best video-conferencing tools can replace a good huddle around a whiteboard. But as said, we're pretty chilled about it, so if you're the right person for us, we'll figure something out.</p><br /></div><br /><h2>Responsibilities</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><ul><br /><li>Develop features for the existing CV Partner application</li><br /><li>Develop the event-sourcing system and platform tools</li><br /><li>Help design and build services on the new platform</li><br /><li>Work closely with DevOps to maintain and enhance the security of CV Partner&rsquo;s systems</li><br /><li>Build internal tools to support business processes</li><br /><li>In the future: Mentor junior or mid-level developers and potentially lead a small team</li><br /></ul><br /></div><br /></div><br /><div><br /><h2>Future challenges</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><ul><br /><li>Break up the current application into smaller services</li><br /><li>Refactor the front-end code, improving the engineering principles around code organisation and testing</li><br /><li>Multi-region production deployments</li><br /><li>Design an effective interview process for junior and mid-level hires</li><br /><li>Automate parsing of CVs and Case Studies - potential for machine learning</li><br /></ul><br /></div><br /></div><br /><div><br /><h2>What we are looking for</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><ul><br /><li>Knowledge in some of the following (Ruby, JavaScript, Clojure, Rust, ElasticSearch, Redis)</li><br /><li>Knowledge of CoffeeScript is not required (we know you won&rsquo;t admit to it anyway)</li><br /><li>Experience in designing microservice architectures</li><br /><li>Enthusiasm to learn new tools and technologies</li><br /><li>Someone with good generalist knowledge: front-end; web development; databases (SQL or otherwise), DevOps; system architecture</li><br /><li>Linux, git, Github knowledge</li><br /><li>Bonus: Event-sourcing/CQRS experience</li><br /><li>Bonus: Front-end expertise</li><br /></ul><br /></div><br /></div><br /><div><br /><h2>Benefits /&nbsp;package</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><p>Location: London, Oslo or Stockholm</p><br /><p>Flexible working / part-remote (with close-to-home co-working)</p><br /><p>Pension contribution</p><br /><p>25 days holiday</p><br /><p>Competitive salary</p><br /><p>Weekly team lunch</p><br /></div><br /></div>",

We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth.</p><p>As a member of the first product engineering team at Crisp you have will have a unique opportunity to turn previously scattered and inconsistently structured data into directly actionable food industry insights to reduce waste, increase freshness and much more.</p><p>You have a proven track record of reading data and making solid conclusions. You know both the art&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;science of analytics - not only do you know how to find answers in the data, you also know which questions should be asked in the first place and what data can help us further bolster our conclusions.&nbsp;You love engaging with customers, learning about their challenges and then diving into the data to see how to solve them!</p><p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborative.</strong>&nbsp;You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together.</li><li><strong>Customer focused.</strong>&nbsp;User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if customers don't enjoy using it.</li><li><strong>Disciplined and reliable.</strong>&nbsp;We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.</li><li><strong>Appreciative of honest feedback.</strong>&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</li><li><strong>Work smarter and harder.</strong>&nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.</li><li><strong>Analytical and practical mind.</strong>&nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.</li></ul><p><strong>Crisp’s tech stack</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Statically typed, modern languages.</strong>&nbsp;We use TypeScript and Kotlin, but knowledge of them is not a requirement and we’re happy to help you come up to speed.</li><li><strong>Continuous deployment.</strong>&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</li><li><strong>JVM based back-end.</strong>&nbsp;The JVM has a robust, rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that we’re leveraging to help us focus on building solutions, not tool-chains.</li><li><strong>Cloud first.</strong>&nbsp;As a services offering in the 21st century, the cloud isn’t the future, it’s the present. We’re fully invested in using the features offered by our cloud provider in order to minimize technical debt and maximize productivity.</li><li><strong>Micro-services.</strong>&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.</li></ul><p>We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific background, experience or geographical location. Instead we’re looking for individuals that are capable, reliable, and hoping to grow along with us. Do you have strengths you can share? If so, we’d love to hear from you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://crisp.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk03hx7?source=StackoverflowJobPosting' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Crisp</h4>            <div><p>Our main goals with Crisp are easy to explain: We want to build a company that we would like to&nbsp;<em>enjoy&nbsp;</em>spending the rest of our careers in, that has a positive impact on the world and that will outlast us.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Fully remote</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Excellent health insurance and benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Founders with proven track record</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Well funded (by founders)</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.</p><p>We are a remote-first company which means we give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living and working wherever you are most comfortable. We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth.</p><p>As a member of the first product engineering team at Crisp you have will have a unique opportunity to turn previously scattered and inconsistently structured data into directly actionable food industry insights to reduce waste, increase freshness and much more.</p><p>You have a proven track record of reading data and making solid conclusions. You know both the art&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;science of analytics - not only do you know how to find answers in the data, you also know which questions should be asked in the first place and what data can help us further bolster our conclusions.&nbsp;You love engaging with customers, learning about their challenges and then diving into the data to see how to solve them!</p><p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborative.</strong>&nbsp;You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together.</li><li><strong>Customer focused.</strong>&nbsp;User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if customers don't enjoy using it.</li><li><strong>Disciplined and reliable.</strong>&nbsp;We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.</li><li><strong>Appreciative of honest feedback.</strong>&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</li><li><strong>Work smarter and harder.</strong>&nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.</li><li><strong>Analytical and practical mind.</strong>&nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.</li></ul><p><strong>Crisp’s tech stack</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Statically typed, modern languages.</strong>&nbsp;We use TypeScript and Kotlin, but knowledge of them is not a requirement and we’re happy to help you come up to speed.</li><li><strong>Continuous deployment.</strong>&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</li><li><strong>JVM based back-end.</strong>&nbsp;The JVM has a robust, rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that we’re leveraging to help us focus on building solutions, not tool-chains.</li><li><strong>Cloud first.</strong>&nbsp;As a services offering in the 21st century, the cloud isn’t the future, it’s the present. We’re fully invested in using the features offered by our cloud provider in order to minimize technical debt and maximize productivity.</li><li><strong>Micro-services.</strong>&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.</li></ul><p>We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific background, experience or geographical location. Instead we’re looking for individuals that are capable, reliable, and hoping to grow along with us.

It sounds so simple, but in reality is much harder to achieve at scale.</p><h4> 2 OurPath </h4><p>OurPath provide a digital lifestyle improvement programme that is proven to help people improve their lifestyle and lose weight, which ultimately reduces their risk for conditions such as type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The programme incorporates evidence-based education, health coaches, peer group support, and digital tracking tools. Everything is delivered digitally through phone and web apps.</p><p>The quickest way to understand what we do is watch this very short 1 min animation:&nbsp;https://vimeo.com/199648301</p><p>We were the first digital behavioural change programme to be commissioned by the NHS – we’re now expanding rapidly having won a few big national contracts (both in diabetes prevention and management).</p><p>Alongside our NHS work, we also offer the programme directly to consumers – you can buy the programme on our website if you’re looking to make a healthy lifestyle change and lose weight. Our direct-to-consumer channel is essentially a competitor to the likes of Weight Watchers and Slimming World.</p><p>About us: We are now a team of 50 – consisting of ex-strategy consultants, dietitians, designers, and developers. We believe OurPath is a fun place to work with an informal, non-bureaucratic, and agile working environment. Finally, we will provide endless amounts of poor jokes and sub-standard humour. Just so you know.</p><p>Some of our national press:</p><p><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/ourpath-raises-3m-in-round-led-by-connect-ventures-to-reverse-type-2-diabetes/' rel='nofollow'>TechCrunch</a></p><p><a href='https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ourpath-diabetes-app-roche-nhs-partnership' rel='nofollow'>Wired</a></p><h4> 3 The role </h4><p>We are looking for a senior data scientist, not only to help us build and grow our product but also our data team.</p><p>What you’ll do:</p><ul><li><strong>Help junior analysts</strong> deliver insightful analysis to discover areas of opportunity that shape the product roadmap.</li><li><strong>Lead the development</strong> of new data-driven product features.</li><li><strong>Work with product</strong> to design and analyse product tests.</li><li><strong>Work with engineering</strong> to ensure that good ETL processes are in place to deliver clean and accurate data to team members.</li><li><strong>Collaborate with members of all teams</strong> to ensure that data is easily accessible to answer business decisions and drive the decision-making process.</li></ul><h4> 4 Person Specification </h4><p>Required:</p><ul><li>Experience querying databases and using statistical computer languages</li><li>Coding knowledge and experience with several languages (Python/R required)</li><li>Experience in Machine Learning applications</li></ul><p>Nice to have:</p><ul><li>Knowledge of a variety of machine learning techniques (clustering, decision tree learning, artificial neural networks, etc.) and their real-world advantages/drawbacks</li><li>Strong knowledge of advanced statistical techniques and concepts (regression, properties of distributions, statistical tests and proper usage, etc.) and experience with applications</li><li>Experience managing a team of data analysts/scientists.</li></ul><h4>   5 What can we offer you? </h4><ul><li>You’ll be able to <strong>provide direct input</strong> into how we should improve our product and the development of OurPath.</li><li>You’ll get to <strong>work with amazing, friendly, smart colleagues</strong> all incredibly passionate about solving the type 2 diabetes epidemic.</li><li>You’ll have <strong>autonomy and responsibility</strong> for your work direction; we also offer a flexible working environment where you can work from home when you need to.</li><li>We have <strong>regular company-sponsored socials</strong> (pub drinks, team dinners, board games and movie nights) that’ll allow you to catch up and make friends outside of your team.</li><li>We all have a <strong>thirst for knowledge</strong> and have regular Lunch&amp;Learn sessions to help us expand our knowledge base; the product team also get together and run quarterly Hackathons.</li></ul><h4> 6 To Apply </h4><p>This position is available to start immediately, so please send your CV and email via this application page: https://workable.com/j/B45EE2ECED</p><p>We’ll be interviewing on a rolling basis, so the quicker you can apply the better.</p><p>If Ben doesn’t respond within 7 days then he’s not intentionally being rude but please assume it’s probably a no for now.</p>",

The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>Notes</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>This position does not have a location requirement and can be performed either remotely (including from outside the U.S.) or from WalletHub’s offices in downtown Washington DC.</li><li>If you're intending to work from outside the US please&nbsp;be aware this position entails working at least 50 hour per week and requires an overlap with EST business hours&nbsp;(8am - 7pm ET, including 1 hour break).</li><li>Although we appreciate your interest in working with us, due to the high number of applications we receive, we will only be able to respond to successful applicants.</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/292504?reset=False&amp;ra=1A5ZYVkMsrMk&amp;oqs=a%3D1A5ZYVkMsrMk' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>            <h4>About Wallethub</h4>            <div><p>WalletHub helps all consumers reach top financial fitness by providing:<br><br>• Free credit scores and credit reports that are updated on a daily basis.<br><br>• Free 24/7 credit monitoring and personalized advice that will help you improve your credit and save money. <br><br>• More reviews on financial products, professionals and companies than any other website.<br><br>• An extensive education center coupled with the ability to ask financial experts your money-related questions for free .</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work visa sponsorship</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from home</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
