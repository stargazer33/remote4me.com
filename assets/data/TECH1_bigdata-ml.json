You will be working in a small team building technology from the ground up with the latest stack.</p><p>One trillion dollars are spent globally each year on commercial insurance. However, the process for estimating the risk associated with a given business across various perils is still reliant on inefficient and inaccurate forms and research. This information asymmetry leads to a broken set of incentives and a poor experience for both businesses and insurers alike. By combining cutting edge data science, enterprise software, and insurance expertise, Kalepa is delivering precision underwriting at scale. Kalepa is turning real-world data into a complete understanding of risk.</p><p>Kalepa's team members have worked at Facebook, Google, Microsoft, APT (acquired by Mastercard for $600M in 2015), the Israel Defense Forces, MIT, Berkeley, and UPenn.

We use messaging channels like Facebook Messenger and SMS to improve the shopping experience for Shopify merchants and their customers. We work closely with Shopify, Klaviyo, Yotpo, and other top tech platforms in the ecommerce space. We are pioneering the future of ecommerce through conversational commerce. We are an all-remote company and venture backed, some of our investors include General Catalyst, Boost VC, and M Ventures. \\n\\nYou will work directly with our CTO Leif K-Brooks (founder and creator of Omegle, the largest chat platform of its kind, used by millions daily), our Director of Engineering, and our product team, to help build Octane AI's back-end technology and front-end experience. You will be in charge of building and implementing new plugins and features. You will be a critical member of the team, impacting our customers and revenue with the features you develop. \\n\\nMore about working in Engineering at Octane AI&nbsp;\\n\\n-We believe the happier you are, the more productive you and the team are. Being a remote company allows us to work from wherever we'd prefer. Spend your evenings and weekends with your family/friends/hobbies. \\n- We hate bureaucracy. Feel free to talk to anyone in the team.&nbsp; \\n- Your ideas are welcome. If you know how to improve our codebase, our product, our processes, don't be shy to share it. \\n- In our weekly meetings we do a fun thing called &quot;fast parrot&quot;. Everybody, including the CEO, is involved. It's a little weird and fun at the same time, especially if you are doing a meeting from a public place. \\n- Our release process involves code review. In rare cases, we deploy without it, but we try hard to make sure at least one more pair of eyes looks at the code. \\n- Flexible working hours. We have only two meetings a week (they're back-to-back) where the whole team participates and it's necessary to be online. For the rest of the time, it's up to you to choose the most productive schedule for your work.&nbsp; \\n- Three days a month we have &quot;maintenance days&quot; where you choose what to work on. Usually we work on tech debt, i.e. code cleanup or purely tech improvements. \\n- Don't work if you are sick. It's way better to rest and recover quicker than work at half power for a long time. \\n- If you feel you are stuck with a task don't hesitate to ask for help. There are no stupid questions, nobody expects you to know everything.\\n\\nRESPONSIBILITIES\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Work with the product team and engineering teammates to develop and implement new features and plugins for Octane AI. A well-rounded &amp; diversified engineer is ideal for this role. If you love working with frontend mostly, that's also fine as long as you are able to change backend whenever needed.\\n\\n* Transform our roadmap and your ideas into scalable products and features. You will have the power to guide the direction of the company and the (many) features we build.\\n\\n* Implement new integrations within Octane AI. You will be working with the Facebook API and the APIs of products and services that we will be integrating into our bots and the Octane AI platform. You should be adept at learning new APIs.\\n\\n* Help develop and improve Octane AI's architecture.\\n\\n* Work quickly and efficiently in a fast-paced startup environment. Be flexible enough to take on any task.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nREQUIREMENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* 3-8+ years of frontend and backend-back development work. The ideal candidate is a top-tier developer who is comfortable in a startup environment -- AKA putting out fires, learning on-the-fly, and thrives on change and new challenges.\\n\\n* Critical skills:&nbsp;Python, Javascript (We use React.js).\\n\\n* Important:&nbsp;Experience working with the Facebook API, Redis, AWS DDB.\\n\\n* Nice to have:&nbsp;ES6/ES7, SASS, React-bootstrap, Redux, Functional programming experience\\n\\n* Please provide code samples or links to repositories with your code, along with an explanation of your programming philosophy. The more we can understand the way you think about code, the better. It's not an issue if you can't share a piece of code because of an NDA or something else.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* The ability to work from anywhere in the world. Our team works from New York, Portland, Barcelona, Austin, Canada, Serbia, Slovenia and more. As long as you can get the work done, we don't care where you are!\\n\\n* Excellent health benefits: health, dental and vision insurance for US employees\\n\\n* 401(k) for US employees\\n\\n* Flexible vacation policy, paid holidays, sick leave and parental leave\\n\\n* Fitness and home office credits. We want your workspace to be your happy place.\\n\\n* Generous stock options\\n\\n* Growth and leadership opportunities. We invest in the tools and training that will help your long-term career.\\n\\n* An amazing team of wonderfully driven and talented people\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Octane AI \\n\\nOctane AI is the bot platform for ecommerce. Octane AI's Facebook Messenger marketing automation software helps Shopify merchants send abandoned cart messages, create custom flows, and increase their sales and revenue. Thousands of merchants and businesses trust Octane AI for their Messenger bots, including GoPro, Pure Cycles, Cover FX, Universal Music Group, Warner Music Group, Maroon 5, and more.  </div> </div>",

Emulating the models of Netflix and Goodreads we're building robust discovery mechanisms, data-driven recommendations, and next-generation tools to engage with theatre and other live performing arts. We are in week three of the public beta of our MVP, have had over 2500 visitors and feedback is positive from users and the industry. Exciting times.&nbsp;Thespie is a disruptive model in our space, so speed is essential - but unrealistic timelines, angst and blame are not part of the equation. We're heads down on building and moving fast because we love what we do, and have big things we need to deliver for theatre-goers.</p><p>You:</p><p>We are looking for a Data Scientist to join us on a project basis (ideally full-time for a handful of weeks) to design and implement a Content-Based Filtering (CBF) algorithm. If time allows we'd also welcome advise on a few other data-related projects, and will in future want to implement a deeper (probably UBCF) recommendation algorithm when we've got loads of user data. We are mostly Python/Django on the backend, infrastructure is nearly all AWS and we use Segment and Redshift for analytics. At this stage we aren't looking to reinvent recommendations or win awards, just get a robust, clean, error-free solution in place for users. So looking for deep experience in quickly implementing straightforward data solutions. We can pay hourly or per project quote.</p><p>Us:</p><p>We're a pretty focused and skilled bunch (ex-Amazon, Zipcar, Fintech, BBC, etc.), based in London and Boston. So you hopefully won't have to waste too much of your time getting us up to speed on your recommended solutions. We love feedback and collaboration and have lots of exciting problems to solve, so would love to find someone that cares about our mission: to remove barriers-to-entry for potential theatre-goers and be the most trusted way to access theatre.&nbsp;We're based in London's South Bank and can provide weekday access to our somewhat unique co-working space :), or we're open to remote as well provided you are an excellent communicator and Slack collaborator.</p><p>If the above sounds like you - or you're excited about what we're doing, please apply and/or connect! We love meeting new people interested in the problems we're solving.</p>",

Launched in the U.K. in December 2018, CoGo wants to transform every pound that U.K. consumers spend into a vote for a better future. The platform is the first tech innovation that has the aim of leveraging spending data and every transaction made by a consumer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>We are the UK&rsquo;s national aggregator of data on accredited businesses and we are using this data, in conjunction with <a href='https://www.openbanking.org.uk/'>Open Banking</a>, to build a platform that can tell our users what percentage of their spending is with businesses that align with their values. This enables our core value proposition: a recommendation engine that helps our users shift more of their spending to ethical and sustainable businesses.</p><br /><h1><strong>ABOUT YOU:&nbsp;</strong></h1><br /><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>You are passionate about the power of data to change the world. You have an analytical mind par excellence, and the breadth of experience and comprehension to grasp the vision whilst grappling with the detail. Your data science is as much a product of your statistical background as it is your technical background. You relish the opportunity to take on new challenges, you can work independently, and you are well connected in the data science community. Ethical data science is your default mode.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>You will get a real kick out of working on models that interact directly with the real world. This is an opportunity to be the brain behind the core feature of an innovative, world-first, user-facing app, at the forefront of ethical consumer tech. You will be itching to get your prototypes in front of users and constantly iterate and test your work.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>CoGo is a values-driven business, and it&rsquo;s our commitment to a better future that drives each and every one of us. You&rsquo;ll love working with us if you care about people and the planet, and believe in the power of data, technology and consumer demand to bring about meaningful change.</p><br /><h1><strong>THE ROLE&nbsp;</strong></h1><br /><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>The data scientist role will be focussed on developing this recommendation engine, starting by prototyping and user testing, then progress towards more sophisticated data models.
