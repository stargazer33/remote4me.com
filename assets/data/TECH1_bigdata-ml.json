    "content": "<br />The company<br /><br />Prolific (www.prolific.ac) brings people together to power the world’s research. It is the first scientific, highly scalable, ethical participant recruitment platform for researchers around the world. Quantitative and qualitative researchers, data scientists, and entrepreneurs all need valid and reliable data sources to make predictions about human behaviour, social change, and global developments. Thanks to our online platform, researchers collect responses fast and participants earn cash rewards for themselves or for charity. It takes 5 minutes to start data collection, there's no middleman, and the product easily integrates with any survey software. In a world of unreliable results, Prolific makes data trustworthy and connects the public with science.<br /><br />The role<br /><br />In this role you will develop and implement data analyses, data collection systems, and other strategies that help us better understand user behaviour as well as our business and product performance. You will be analysing data using statistical techniques with a focus on understanding our growth engine, users’ full life cycle, data quality, and user demographics (for representative sampling): How does Prolific currently acquire, convert, and retain its users (both Researchers and Participants)? And what can be done to improve user acquisition, conversion, and retention? What are the current demographics of the pool, and what differences are there to the general population? Which participants are the most honest and engaged, and which are not?<br /><br />You will have an opportunity to learn about the startup ecosystem, about the lean startup approach, and about user acquisition techniques and growth strategies. More broadly, you will get the chance to learn about business and product development, data science, and diverse research areas in the social and natural sciences.<br /><br />This is your chance to get involved in a fast-moving startup where you’ll have huge influence over the trajectory of the product. Since it’s a startup, you’ll have the opportunity to suggest how you can best add value, and make any recommendations about improving the processes and product. We're a fast-growing company and we want to help you grow with us.<br /><br />Working closely with our analysis team, developers and leadership you will work towards these key goals:<br /><br />Analyse what drives the growth of our platform and what is the best allocation of resources in order to improve this growth<br />Improve the quality, the honesty, and engagement of Prolific’s participant pool through analysis of user behaviour and collection of new data<br />Improve the diversity and representativeness of Prolific’s participant pool by ongoing monitoring of demographics<br />This will likely involve some or all of the following:<br /><br />Analyse key growth metrics, retention, stickiness, churn over time and determine causal links between product changes and growth. Work closely with management and use these data to influence key decisions and help our startup grow quickly<br />Use analytics software such as Amplitude to create visualisations, segment our user base, and develop dashboards to track key growth, data quality, and demographic metrics over time<br />Develop a clear understanding of our community and intersect this qualitative data with quantitative data and develop a plan of key questions to answer with data<br />Extract data from non-SQL/SQL databases for analyses in a reproducible way for downstream analysis or work closely with developers in order to achieve this<br />Statistically analyse large data sets (millions of rows) and draw robust conclusions from these data with the understanding that large data sets are messy, and it is easy to draw incorrect conclusions from these data if our analyses are not robust<br />Develop attention checks, consistency checks and longitudinal measures designed to track participants’ consistency, honesty, and engagement<br />Proactively suggest new questions to ask, new data to collect, or product changes to make based on insights from data<br />Generate regular reports in a reproducible manner which clearly and accurately describe the collection, organisation, and analysis of your data<br />Disseminate the key information to the whole organisation in written reports and summaries, which highlight the key insights you’ve gained and which are easily interpretable and actionable<br />Benefits<br /><br />Salary: £28,000-32,000 (p.a.), negotiable based on experience and qualifications, plus:<br />Pension (employer contribution 3% of base salary)<br />Flexible working: Work equipment of your choice, you can work flexibly from home or from our coworking space, flexible hours<br />25 days holiday per year, plus bank holidays<br />Flexible budget for any books and/or educational material<br />Personal growth opportunities (e.g., learn about the startup ecosystem, mentoring from executive team, learn about psychological science and research methods)<br />Open, transparent, and inclusive culture<br />Self-made cider and home-baked cookies :-)<br />How we interview & hire<br /><br />Our hiring process usually begins with an introductory online interview to help you get to know us better, and vice versa. At this stage, we would like to better understand your motivation for the role, get to know about your interests and personality, and learn about any relevant past experience or skills you might have. If this initial interview is successful, we'd then invite you to complete an assignment ("

At InterWorks, we’re more interested in candidates who are hard-working, smart&nbsp;and love what they do. We care more about overall data and programming skills rather than experience with a certain database platform. Whether you have worked primarily in SQL Server, Postgres or something else, we only ask that you have a strong understanding of building data pipelines and can apply your skills within our fast-paced and agile approach.</p><p>While some companies may hide their data engineers away in some dungeon, data engineers at InterWorks are social, friendly creatures.

Data Engineers can expect to work on diverse projects ranging from a few days to several months. Many of these projects include solving data acquisition, integration and management problems for some of the largest organizations in the world. Projects also include working with disparate data sources (Relational databases, flat files, Excel, HDFS/Big Data systems, high-performance analytical databases, etc.) to unify client data, creating ETL processes based on client needs&nbsp;and managing client expectations.</p><p>InterWorks prides itself on having an exciting work environment, with a unique&nbsp;company culture. InterWorks employees are some of the most intelligent and friendly people you will ever meet, and they are the primary reason for the success of InterWorks.

At Simon Data we take that literally. We take pride in what we do every day and how we do it. Providing great software to our customers is rewarding and energizing. We've found a rapidly expanding sweet spot in marketing software and are diversifying our engineering team to keep up with the demand. </p><p>New engineers are welcomed into a team of smart and passionate engineers who love data and writing pragmatic code. We believe that you code better when you know how your work connects to the product and our clients. We also believe that you code better when you're surrounded by other engineers who want you to succeed. This attitude is core to our values.</p><p>As a Core &amp; Data Software Engineer, you'll be exposed to the core of our software and the data it keeps. From your first day on the job, you'll have the opportunity to:</p><p>- Interface with data from dozens of clients, each of which have upwards of a terabyte of data (SQL technologies). <br>- Own the build out our data pipe, aggregating data from both structured and unstructured sources (Hadoop, Spark, HDFS, EMR, Redshift). <br>- Scale and optimize our client facing data warehouse that provides real-time interactivity across millions of rows of data (Redshift, Elasticsearch).<br>- Lead development of statistical models and predictive technology to improve our experimentation and segmentation tooling (Machine learning, D3). <br>- Develop critical features to in our python software stack. <br>- Collaborate with an engineering team who is passionate about quality, staying ahead of the curve, and teamwork.</p><p>Our clients rely on us for accurate data and availability. Making mistakes in our business has direct effects on our clients' customers. We take both of these facts very seriously. At odds with this, Simon embraces the startup ethos of keeping lean and focused. We move quickly (continuous deployment) and emphasize experimentation to test hypotheses.

    "content": "*ABOUT US*<br /><br />Do you want to build an exciting new brand in an industry ripe for a makeover?<br /><br />Join us on our mission.<br /><br />At Laka, we believe that traditional insurance fails to offer peace of mind. It’s an inconvenience people have to deal with – unpleasant, expensive and unfair. <br /><br />Laka has a new way to protect your favourite things in the world.<br /><br />What makes us truly different is that members of our community don’t pay a fixed premium every year, but only share the true cost of claims incurred by the community. Simple, but truly disruptive (Sorry for the D-word).<br /><br />The first thing we have chosen to insure are high-end bicycles. For that, we have assembled a community of real cyclists who protect each other's bikes against whatever happens. <br /><br />Every month Laka helps community members in need - when their gear is damaged or stolen. At the end of the month, all costs are split between the community, but each member’s premium is capped at market rate. Instead of paying hefty margins, our customers know they will always get the best price for great cover. <br /><br />Insurance that just works.<br /><br />We went from concept to regulated business with a live product in 12 months. On the way, we joined fantastic ecosystems such as Anthemis’ Fellowship program and  Startupbootcamp InsurTech, gathering a stellar host of business angels around us. <br /><br />You can be an integral part of the brilliant team taking the business from hundreds to thousands of customers. With our revolutionary approach to insurance, we have the opportunity to relentlessly challenge the status quo in insurance and build a brand which truly reflects our mission.  <br /><br />We’re currently a team of 7, so everyone is vitally important to our success. You’ll be working directly with the company founders and will get to experience life in a startup company as we scale! We encourage you to get involved with any aspect of the business you are interested in. T-shaped people are the best! <br /><br />Our office is in Oxford Circus, but we are flexible and understand sometimes you just need to work from home or wherever inspires you the most.<br /><br />The specifics (including the final title) of the role will vary depending on your experience, but in any case, it will grow with you. We want bright people to join us on our journey.<br /><br />*ABOUT YOU*<br /><br />Ideally, you can hit the ground running, have an interest in learning new things, and are comfortable working in a (constantly!) changing environment.<br /><br />You have an eye for design, and like to use this in solving both real world and technical problems. You are familiar with (at least some of) our current front-end stack: Javascript (ES6), React, Redux, GraphQL. <br />Most importantly you should be well versed with idiosyncrasies of HTML/CSS.<br /> <br />You have exposure to Git, and have worked in an agile environment. <br /><br />You must have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />*BONUS POINTS*<br /><br />- Full-stack or backend development experience (Node.js, MySQL, AWS). <br />- Experience designing/building Native mobile apps.<br />- Experience with (or interest in) AI and machine learning or data visualisation would be a plus (our internal systems are based on data science/ML processes).<br />- A passion for cycling!<br /><br />*OUR OFFER*<br /><br />- £20-50k annual salary (dependent on experience)<br />- Stock options: level depending on experience and expertise<br />- Flexible Holiday Policy<br />- Great working environment either in a Shared office space near Oxford Circus or a New Location in Bristol<br />- Flexible work arrangements: as long as the work gets done<br />- Generous Conference/Training budget<br />- Child-care vouchers<br />- Cycle to work scheme<br />- Regular team off-sites to collectively decide our future<br />- Weekly team lunch<br /><br />Above all: an opportunity to make a real impact in an archaic industry<br /><br />*THE PROCESS*<br /><br />We aim to reply to all applicants within a week of receiving your application. Our interview process will have of several stages, each allowing us getting to know you better, professionally and technically - and for you to understand our culture and ethos. <br /><br />The stages include: <br />-    CV and code sample/portfolio review<br />-    Coding Test<br />-    Phone / Video interview<br />-    Face to Face interview<br /><br />We hope to get all the above done within 2-3 weeks, depending on your availability and convenience."

We’ve built our platform out largely on Java8 Dropwizard services, a handful of Golang services and some C++ where performance is critical. We leverage Kafka as our main service bus, Cassandra for long term storage, our in-house stream processing framework for online analytics, ClickHouse for large scale log storage, and we rely on Zookeeper as a core part of intra/inter-service coordination. Our data pipeline pushes millions of messages a second and tens of terabytes of logs per day.</p><p>All team members, whether in San Francisco, one of many offices, or remote, commit code to Github, communicate over Slack and Hangouts, push code to production via our ChatOps bot, and run all production applications on AWS. We also use an array of best-breed SaaS applications to get code to production quickly and reliably. We are a team that is committed to a healthy work/life balance.</p><p>At SolarWinds Cloud you get all the benefits of a small startup, with the backing of a big company so there is no worry about the next round of funding.
