The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:<br><br>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.<br><br>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.<br><br>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.<br><br>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.<br><br>How to Apply<br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:<br><br>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.<br><br>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.<br><br>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.<br><br>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.<br><br>How to Apply<br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Software* *Engineer*<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />As Software Engineer you’ll be at the forefront of the next stage of the Switchee platform as enter an exciting period of growth. As a start-up this role will involve working in all areas of the platform: frontend, backend, data analytics and more.<br /><br />* Help design and implement scalable cloud-based solutions for the Switchee platform<br />* Creating internal and external API’s for our hardware, web apps and partners<br />* Developing responsive and engaging web applications<br />* Building out the next version of our real-time streaming analytics system<br />* Support the product team with user testing and development feedback<br />* Collaborate with our Firmware team to ensure our hardware and software work seamlessly<br /><br /><br />*Your* *Experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:<br /><br />* Experience working with IoT device<br />* Knowledge of Event sourcing and Domain Driven Design patterns<br />* Devops, infrastructure as code<br />* Containers and/or Serverless<br /><br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We occasionally work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now!

    "content": "*SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE*<br /><br />OLIO is the world’s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and our mission is to solve the problem of food waste in the home & local community. We do this by connecting anyone with spare food – which can be households or local businesses – with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away £800 of food each year - collectively adding up to £15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile & web apps. Over the past 2 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. <br /><br />We now have over 465,000 users who have together shared well over half a million portions of food – with food being successfully shared in 32 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our volunteer programme, with over 19,000 people reaching out to spread the word about OLIO in their local community and rescue unsold food.<br /><br />OLIO is now looking to grow our core team as we embark upon the next exciting phase in our journey.<br /><br />*JOIN OUR TEAM!*<br /><br />In order to accelerate OLIO to its next level in growth and impact, we are recruiting for a Data Analyst & Dashboard Developer, who will report into Viv Taylor, Product Manager.<br /><br />In this role you will be responsible for:<br /><br />* Data Analysis: Analysing key business questions in our burgeoning data via an SQL interface (both through<br />GUI and command line tools)<br />* Data Visualization: Development of a “data dashboard” for the company to help us interrogate our data<br />visually and in a user friendly manner<br />* Data Innovation: Liaison with our broader OLIO team to ensure that the right questions are being asked of<br />our growing datasets, in the right order.<br />* Data Exploration: Evaluation of the effects of specific initiatives/experiments at OLIO, generating and<br />presenting reports of their efficacy<br />* Setup of regular reports that provide insight into ongoing company/departmental performance.<br />* Assisting with online ad creative endeavours, their implementation and analysing their impact<br /><br />Once you have proven yourself you will have great freedom and autonomy, coupled with an enormous opportunity for personal development. All of our roles are remote working roles, however for London based team members<br />there is the ability to co-work as well. We live for our mission, but like to have fun along the way!<br /><br />*IS THIS YOU?*<br /><br />Our ideal candidate will first and foremost be as passionate about our mission as we are!
