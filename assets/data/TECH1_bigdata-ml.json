More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong><br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

    "content": "About us<br /><br />Disperse is a VC-backed artificial intelligence construction startup focused on improving on-site productivity with the help of computer vision. Our goal is to ultimately re-imagine the way building projects are planned, delivered and operated.<br /><br />We're currently working on some of the largest building projects in London (e.g. Renzo Piano’s Shard Place, Wood Wharf) and have grown from 5 to 35 people over the past year. We have ambitions to expand significantly, which means that we are looking for passionate and enthusiastic talent to join the team.<br /><br />We move at a high speed, and will provide you with immense opportunities for initiative, creativity and leadership. Our proudly diverse, international team is based in London, Sarajevo and Yerevan, and has a wealth of experience from construction management to computer vision and robotics.<br /><br /><br /><br />Your role<br /><br />We are looking for a highly motivated and passionate Computer Vision Engineering Intern to join our growing team. Someone who is excited at the prospect of applying deep knowledge and expertise to shape the future of the construction industry and to have a direct impact on productivity.<br /><br />As part of your role, you will collaborate with our senior Computer Vision researchers and the wider Engineering team to both use and craft state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to creatively solve real-world problems in the construction sector. Interns form a core part of our team, so you will be given lots of responsibility from day one, driving your own project which would involve creating interactive prototypes and seeing your algorithms go live in production.<br /><br />If you're eager to learn and take on responsibility, this role is a superb opportunity to grow and build your skills in a world-class team. You will also receive regular mentoring from different members of the team to make your experience at Disperse the best it can be.<br /><br />This is an opportunity to join in at the start of something new, and if you prove to be a great fit after the internship period, we'll happily convert you to an equitable full-time position.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our culture<br /><br />Ask anyone at Disperse what they love most about working here, and they'll probably tell you &quot;it's the people!&quot;, &quot;the team, of course&quot;, &quot;the people and the Hedwig owls in the offices&quot;.<br /><br />As cliched as it may sound, we're very proud of the people we have and the close-knit, family culture we've built across London, Sarajevo and Yerevan. Despite the distances, we're united through the passion with which we approach our goals and the fun that we have along the way. We always look out for each other, no matter what. The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:<br /><br />We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.<br /><br />We support each other.

    "content": "WHO IS BEELINE?<br /><br />Beeline is on a mission to help the world have better journeys on two wheels through great navigation software and hardware. Founded in 2015 by Mark and Tom, two friends who wanted to solve getting lost in London on their bikes, Beeline has now grown into a healthy young business with big ambitions to grow (currently in discussions with VC backers to accelerate this further)<br /><br /><br />Beeline’s first product, the Velo, is a beautifully designed device that sits on the bike handlebar and gives navigation guidance to the rider. It was launched on Kickstarter in 2015, and has since sold over 10,000 units. The Moto (the edition for motorcycles) is launching this month and has already taken over 9,000 pre-orders. The first deal to integrate into shared bikes and scooters, or micromobility, has recently been confirmed, with several others in the pipeline – the number of Beeline users will at least triple in the next 9 months. In parallel, we’re building machine learning mapping and routing algorithms dedicated to bikes and scooters, with backing from the European Space Agency. <br /><br />Micromobility is set to be part of the transport solution for our ever more crowded cities. So it’s not only the hottest topic in tech right now but done right, has the potential to have a real impact for good by decongesting and depolluting our cities. <br /><br />We firmly believe that great navigation will be a key enabler to that growth and are very excited to have closed our first deal (the first in the industry). However, we want to be THE navigation provider to this whole industry, not just to one player, and we need someone to lead the charge on that ambition. <br /><br />WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:<br /><br />We’re looking for someone to work directly with the founders of the business to drive our growth into micrombility. The role will be a blend of strategy and sales - becoming an expert in this fast growing industry and building strong relationships with decision makers inside some of the fastest growing tech companies right now as well as the city officials who are trying to keep up with them. You’ll also help shape our product strategy by bringing your thinking to how we offer value to these operators beyond just navigation and cement our position as an invaluable layer in the industry. <br /><br />You’ll have a year or two of commercial experience under your belt and be comfortable with market analysis. More important than your experience will be your ability to think analytically, look at the big strategic picture and most importantly, be fascinated by how the shifts in urban transport could change the shape of cities in the future!<br /><br /><br />IMPACT OF THE WORK:<br />Two wheeled transport is set to play a huge role in the future of our cities as well as a leisure activity, and we think our products will be a key enabler to this growth. Bike use is growing for good reasons – the combined impact of improving citizens’ health and wellbeing as well as the broader environmental benefits make this a no brainer. <br /><br />The trend in micromobility is a huge driver in this change (as well as two wheeled delivery fleets like Deliveroo and Uber Eats and the growth of e-bikes). Providing them with great navigation will both enable them to grow and maximise their positive impact and will likely be the strongest area of growth for our business for the next few years. So you’ll be absolutely pivotal in the success of Beeline as well as making the world a better place. <br /><br /><br />WE CAN OFFER YOU:<br />A competitive salary and generous options (shares)<br />Hands on startup experience working with the founders in a business-critical role <br />A part to play in the future of urban transport<br />A relaxed, supportive and jovial team culture - we aim to take our work seriously without taking ourselves too seriously. Socials in the pub or running round the local park are commonplace! <br />The opportunity to shape the future of this young, growing company<br /><br />YOU CAN OFFER US:<br />1-3 years commercial experience (likely finance or consulting, but not a must)<br />Interest in the future of cities and mobility<br />A rounded skillset: <br />Research skills<br />analytical skills for developing Go-To-Market strategy<br />Strong interpersonal skills for developing relations with cities and operators<br />Creativity, especially for product strategy<br />Comfortable designing and implementing processes - this is a fairly new role in a fast-paced area: adaptability and speed of execution will be crucial",

Qntfy is a small (but growing) company offering a diverse array of products and services. As a result, data scientists at Qntfy tend to wear a greater number of hats than they might at larger organizations. This can range from occasionally interfacing directly with customers in a consultative role to preparing papers and presentations for academic journals or conferences (see&nbsp;<a href='https://qntfy.com/research/' rel='nofollow'>here</a>&nbsp;to get a sense of our recent work). We recognize that “data science” is a broad term, and that highly qualified data scientists come from a wide variety of backgrounds and career trajectories. As such, we do not have a rigid checklist of qualifications, but we do expect successful candidates to be able to demonstrate extensive experience with most of the qualifications below. Similarly, we do not have strict educational requirements for data scientists, but of course advanced degrees in quantitative disciplines (broadly construed) are viewed favorably. Our current team of data scientists have backgrounds in bioengineering, cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience, and chemistry.</p><p>U.S. Citizenship Required</p><p><strong>Responsibilites</strong></p><ul><ul><li>Prototype machine learning models of natural language and human behavioral data.</li><li>Conduct bespoke analyses using inferential statistics for internal and external clients.</li><li>Work directly with Qntfy engineers to add data science features to our products.</li><li>Communicate with peers, customers, and partners to foster cooperation and development.</li><li>Effectively estimate time to implement designs.</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p><ul><ul><li>Common machine learning algorithms and/or advanced inferential statistical techniques.</li><li>Standard Python data science tools (e.g., Pandas, scikit-learn; some of us have a soft spot for R and use it occasionally, but we expect data scientists to largely adhere to a Python-based ecosystem).</li><li>Common flavors of SQL and SQL databases.</li><li>Linux operating systems.</li><li>Analysis of natural language data.</li><li>Analysis of (especially observational) human behavioral data (e.g., survey data, psychological inventories).</li><li>Basic project management tools and processes.</li><li>Communicating the results of quantitative work, orally and in writing, to technical and non-technical audiences.</li></ul></ul><p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></p><ul><ul><li>Experience with deep learning frameworks.</li><li>Experience with technologies from the following list: Kafka, Docker, Mesos, Marathon, Kubernetes, Go.</li><li>Knowledge of, or experience with, behavioral science, psychology, mental health, and/or the healthcare industry.</li></ul></ul><p>Qntfy is committed to fostering and supporting a creative and diverse environment.

To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.</p><p>We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.</p><p>We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.</p><p>We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.</p><p>We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).</p><p>We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions.</p><p>In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.</p><p>We look forward to hearing from&nbsp;you</p><p></p><a href='https://stripe.com/jobs/listing/full-stack-billing/978105/apply' rel='nofollow'></a><strong>APPLY NOW</strong><p></p><em>At Stripe, we’re looking for people with passion, grit, and integrity.

That is 11 times more than the average population. This condition has distressing symptoms that deeply affect social and professional interactions and defines the life choices of those people who stammer (PWS).

    "content": "ABOUT COMPANY<br />(https://arway.app)<br /><br />ARWAY is An indoor navigation platform that uses augmented reality (AR) and voice guidance, enabled by machine learning (AI) to connect, inform, guide users and ensure building safety.<br /><br />Our vision is to better enhance the lives of everyone by making context aware AR solutions an accessible part of every day reality. Location awareness is critical to realising AR’s full potential and remains at the heart of the tools we develop.<br /><br />The tragedy of Grenfell Tower fire in the summer of 2017 motivated ARWAY’s founder, Baran Korkmaz, to initially design a prototype app to guide people to fire exits and point out safety equipment. <br /><br />In 2017, Baran’s early prototype ‘IMAREC’ won awards from the British Invention Show and The Big Bang Fair as well as gaining nationwide media coverage from Sky News, BBC, The Guardian. <br /><br />Fast forward to 2019, we have completed 3 successful test-pilots including one of the worlds biggest hospitals. Supported by the IFE and NFCC in advising our user safety functionality in emergency situations. We are confident that we will disrupt the indoor location market by this year with our 2+ year R&D tech into making a scalable product.<br /><br />ABOUT THE ROLE<br /><br />We are looking for an exceptionally passionate, driven, creative and organised individual to lead as the 'Head of Business’  here at ARWAY.

The roadmap possibilities will also very quickly take the tool into machine learning and AI, so this person needs to be up for a challenge!<br /><br />Position Overview:<br />* Part-time moving to Full-time based on revenue and funding.<br />* Chance to own the full product roadmap and development plan.<br />* Remote, flexible working, but should be London based for when the team starts to scale.<br />* Start date – ASAP.<br /><br />What we are looking for:<br />* Self-starter, ideally with experience in B2B SaaS.<br />* Good all-rounder tech leader with the desire to hire and build a team in time.<br />* Hands-on with development, not afraid to research and learn new techniques quickly.<br />* The ability to accelerate the final development of the BETA product to gain revenue traction ASAP.<br />* Identify the most efficient and resourceful ways of scaling the product post launch, adding functionality on an iterative basis to ensure the product quickly starts to reach Enterprise level and higher pricing bands.<br />* Comfortable developing a technology strategy and supporting the CEO with corresponding pitch deck materials.<br />* Ideally experience in machine learning and algorithm building – if not experience, then at least a willingness to learn on the job.<br />* Experience in MarTech is not essential, as you will work closely with the CEO who has a number of years’ experience in this field.<br /><br />Benefits:<br />* Equity holding in the business.<br />* Direct entry into a key decision-making, senior role.<br />* Competitive salary dependent on revenue and funding when the time comes.<br />* Opportunity to work independently and remotely.<br /><br />This will be a hugely rewarding and exciting opportunity for the right candidate. If it sounds interesting to you, then please get in touch.",

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p><p>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.
