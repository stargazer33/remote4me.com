We want to enable organizations to harness the power of data<br><br></div><div>to realize their boldest ideas, much faster, and with greater efficiency than ever before - all without any data engineering.<br><br></div><div>Our goal is to deploy and operate high performance computing infrastructure so customers don't have to. That’s why we’re building next-generation tools like Wallaroo, a highly efficient stream-processing engine that scales to volumes that traditional big data solutions can’t.<br><br></div><div>Our technology runs as a service inside a client’s own environment, whether in any cloud, on-premise, or at the edge, and plays nicely with modern data, messaging, analytics, and machine learning ecosystems.<br><br></div><div>We believe this is a $40B+ market opportunity and we aim to take a good chunk of it. We’re a seed-stage company that’s raised $6M from some of the best enterprise software investors in NYC, and we’re looking for ambitious people to grow our team and our business, enhance our culture, and contribute great ideas.<br><br></div><div><strong>The Position<br></strong><br></div><div>We believe in hiring strong engineers and letting them apply their unique skills and experiences to make our team and product better. That said, there are a few must-have requirements that are needed to do well in our environment. Beyond those, we are looking for candidates who have skills that draw from our &quot;nice to have qualifications&quot; list.<br><br></div><div>Requirements:<br><br></div><ul><li>Experience building high-volume data processing applications</li><li>Experience deploying and running production systems at scale</li><li>Experience analyzing and improving system performance</li><li>Experience developing software and deployment systems for AWS or other cloud providers</li><li>Experience developing on *Nix system (shell, scripts, tools, etc) with version control (e.g. git)</li><li>Self-motivated and able to work both independently and collaboratively</li><li>Excellent written and verbal skills, and good at async communication</li><li>A self-guided learner with the ability to pick up new skills and languages quickly</li><li>Desire to help those around you grow and learn from you</li><li>Thrive in an environment where the long-term goal remains stable but day-to-day needs may change quickly</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Nice to Have Qualifications:<br><br></div><ul><li>Experience running production systems</li><li>Prior experience working with customers either external or business-oriented</li><li>Experience working with/designing/building distributed systems</li><li>Experience developing multi-threaded programs</li><li>Experience using a &quot;strongly typed&quot; language</li><li>Experience developing compilers</li><li>Experience with supporting running systems</li><li>Experience with infrastructure-as-code systems (Ansible, Terraform, Pulimi, etc)</li><li>Experience analyzing system performance</li><li>Experience developing for AWS or other cloud systems</li><li>Excellent teaching skills</li><li>Strong algorithmic and mathematical skills</li><li>Strong understanding of memory management (manual memory management, garbage collection)</li><li>Familiarity with open-source streaming data and message queuing technologies</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Engineering Values<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Distributed First<ul><li>We are a fully distributed team with a base of operations in NYC and engineers ranging from California to the Netherlands. Our processes are always distributed first, with an emphasis on effective asynchronous communication.</li></ul></li><li>Communication<ul><li>One of our mottos is: “If it wasn’t communicated, it didn’t happen.” Communication is always crucial to effective collaboration, but in a distributed setting it becomes even more important.</li><li>Email, text chat, and documentation are important tools to communicate across time zones and geography. Voice conferences bring us together despite working in different countries.</li><li>We bring up concerns early, and share objectives, context and work progress in public. We value clarity and making assumptions explicit.</li></ul></li><li>Lifelong Learning<ul><li>We value a commitment to learning, and see the ability to quickly get up to speed on new languages, technologies, and ideas as just as important as specialized knowledge, if not more. We stress a growth mindset, and know that listening can take effort but is crucial to understanding.</li></ul></li><li>Self-motivation and Accountability<ul><li>Our engineers excel at working independently and flexibly collaborating with the right people for the job. We proactively get involved when help is needed.</li></ul></li><li>Respect and Openness<ul><li>We know that we’re working with human beings with their own lives, concerns, and perspectives. We strive for charitable interpretation and empathy. We value constructive disagreement and challenging assumptions, but only when this is done with respect. We realize that even if you are an expert in some area, you can still learn from the fresh perspectives of novices, which means humility is not only reasonable, but essential to overcoming blind spots.</li></ul></li><li>The Right Tool for the Job<ul><li>We know that in software engineering, there are no silver bullets. No language, framework, tool, or process is “The One, True Way”. We look for the right tool for the job, and depending on the circumstances, this may or may not be Wallaroo!</li></ul></li><li>Adaptability<ul><li>Our engineers have to be ready to adapt to changing circumstances and temporarily take on roles that might be a bit outside their job description. We value comfort with uncertainty and an openness to experimentation.</li></ul></li><li>Everyone a Teacher<ul><li>In a smaller startup, we need everyone to be a generalist to some degree. That’s part of the reason we value sharing knowledge, skills, and perspectives so much. Our engineers are eager to keep learning, but they’re also eager to teach their colleagues what they know, and to experiment with more effective ways to make this kind of information readily available.</li></ul></li></ul><div><br></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity in our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.<br><br></div><div><br></div></div>",

Unemployment has thus far doubled, with more people furloughed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Larks connects these two audiences by creating a marketplace that offers online social activities supplied by the community.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Our vision</strong></p><br /><p>Imagine a world where anyone interested in taking part in a club, activity or learning a new skill could do so easily from home. From cooking, reading, knitting, photography, nutrition and many more, you can invite existing friends to join your experience or make new friends through shared passions.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Imagine being able to launch a new activity or club centred around your passion, and make money out of it from home. The scope is enormous, the market in the millions and impact on people's mental and social well-being profoundly positive. There is currently no single place for people to easily find relevant and engaging online social activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Most online activity marketplaces are based around face to face activities, online there are many streamed instructional videos but few interactive experiences where you can genuinely engage with others. Larks is the first marketplace that makes it easy to list and find online, community-lead social activities.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>This is an opportunity to work on a greenfield project in an industry that is undergoing sector re-defining changes as we speak. Millions of people are socialising differently and have been forced to change their mindsets around online interactions and what it means to be part of a community. We&rsquo;re building the first home of online activities and communities as demand sky-rockets. This is an opportunity to join at the beginning and be a key part of an exciting and fast-growing project. We&rsquo;re an experienced team, working remotely with a strong culture. We have a large network of activity providers and have spotted this gap in the market through testing a live and successful MVP.</p><br /><p><strong>About you&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;re a talented software engineer with over 5 years of development experience at high-growth tech start-ups. You&rsquo;ve ideally been part of the development team in a marketplace business. You are passionate about our mission of building online communities and excited about how early-stage we are.</p><br /><p>There&rsquo;s some flexibility around how the role could be structured depending on experience and availability.</p><br /><p><strong>Apply</strong></p><br /><p>Apply with a link to your Linked in profile (or a CV) and a brief note to explain why you&rsquo;re interested in this opportunity.</p>",

We are a team of multinational people with various domain of expertise ranging from business, to data science, to logistics, to software development, to finance… A nice blend of domain and technology expertise.</p><p><strong>CEL is putting together a full product team to create a ground breaking Simulation As A Service offer that will deeply impact the supply chain industry.</strong></p><p><em>Why is Supply Chain important?</em></p><p>Take a second and look around you - everything you see has came to you through a supply chain, starting from a natural resource into your home through hundreds of activities more or less coordinated so you have what you want when you want.</p><p>So Supply Chain is everything of the physical world. Without supply chains, there are no businesses, no jobs, no buildings, no economy, nothing.</p><p>So we think that it’s kind of important.</p><p>After 15 years of working with hundred of companies that make and distribute their products (from milk to shoes, from furniture to cement, from electronics to vegetables….) we have came to a simple conclusion: it is too complex for people to operate properly. Current IT system, organisation, processes actually don’t help much. All these networks of flows are inherently inefficient.</p><p>Why? Complexity. No human brain is capable to comprehend the actual dynamics of such complex systems. No IT tool, no ERP, no fancy solution is actually taking a holistic view of the problem, instead each of these focus on improving small pieces.</p><p>The result? massive wastes of resources, enormous amount of inventory, unnecessary impact on the environment… and ultimately rare are the cases when supply actually meets demand, creating massive systemic effect and rather low customer satisfaction. Pure waste.</p><p>So we decided to really do something about it.</p><p>We are currently developing a product that that combines technologies like Data Science, Simulation Modelling, Cloud computing - backed up with years of business experience - to help companies actually assess what their future could look like and figure out what alternatives exist.</p><p>To replace the common approach of guessing what could happen, we are aiming at answering “What if” questions in an easy, sexy and fast manner.</p><p>Imagine you could simulate various scenario of your own future, would your life decisions be better? Most likely!</p><p>If the challenge is of interest to you, if you are keen to understand how product-driven businesses actually works, if you are willing to make full use of your systemic thinking and bridge the gap between the physical and virtual world, and if you have the competencies we are after, then we may pretty much want to work together to change the world!</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shares and revenu shares</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full remote possible</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team trips to Vietnam (head office)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly team retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Cross field product with a huge disruption potential</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We are a team of multinational people with various domain of expertise ranging from business, to data science, to logistics, to software development, to finance… A nice blend of domain and technology expertise.</p><p><strong>CEL is putting together a full product team to create a ground breaking Simulation As A Service offer that will deeply impact the supply chain industry.</strong></p><p><em>Why is Supply Chain important?</em></p><p>Take a second and look around you - everything you see has came to you through a supply chain, starting from a natural resource into your home through hundreds of activities more or less coordinated so you have what you want when you want.</p><p>So Supply Chain is everything of the physical world. Without supply chains, there are no businesses, no jobs, no buildings, no economy, nothing.</p><p>So we think that it’s kind of important.</p><p>After 15 years of working with hundred of companies that make and distribute their products (from milk to shoes, from furniture to cement, from electronics to vegetables….) we have came to a simple conclusion: it is too complex for people to operate properly. Current IT system, organisation, processes actually don’t help much. All these networks of flows are inherently inefficient.</p><p>Why? Complexity. No human brain is capable to comprehend the actual dynamics of such complex systems. No IT tool, no ERP, no fancy solution is actually taking a holistic view of the problem, instead each of these focus on improving small pieces.</p><p>The result? massive wastes of resources, enormous amount of inventory, unnecessary impact on the environment… and ultimately rare are the cases when supply actually meets demand, creating massive systemic effect and rather low customer satisfaction. Pure waste.</p><p>So we decided to really do something about it.</p><p>We are currently developing a product that that combines technologies like Data Science, Simulation Modelling, Cloud computing - backed up with years of business experience - to help companies actually assess what their future could look like and figure out what alternatives exist.</p><p>To replace the common approach of guessing what could happen, we are aiming at answering “What if” questions in an easy, sexy and fast manner.</p><p>Imagine you could simulate various scenario of your own future, would your life decisions be better? Most likely!</p><p>If the challenge is of interest to you, if you are keen to understand how product-driven businesses actually works, if you are willing to make full use of your systemic thinking and bridge the gap between the physical and virtual world, and if you have the competencies we are after, then we may pretty much want to work together to change the world!</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shares and revenu shares</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full remote possible</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team trips to Vietnam (head office)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly team retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Cross field product with a huge disruption potential</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
