So far our extraction capabilities include automated product and article extraction from single pages, and we plan to expand it to support whole-domain, and also support more page types like jobs and news. The service is still in early stages of development, serving its first customers.Our platform has several components communicating via Apache Kafka. Most components are written in Python, with a few components implemented with Scala and Kafka Streams.

The strength of our business model is that it incentivises consumers, advertisers and our retailer distribution network to not just personally gain, but also collaborate on utilising the value of our platform to solve wider social, environmental and economic problems facing us all.

Of course there’s plenty of flexibility and lots of opportunities to grow, but we also have share options, private health insurance, and unlimited leave (with a minimum of 5.6 weeks per year - just so everyone actually takes time off). Our CEO is (really) devoted to making Rotageek the best place to work, and so while we work really, really hard, we definitely play hard, too. And we have nice snacks, good beer, amazing team events and a roof terrace.</p><p><b>Your role&nbsp;</b></p><p>We’re looking for someone who will work closely with our Data Science/Engineering teams to maintain operational and reporting data processes for our clients. You’ll be responsible for importing and exporting data from our databases, data migrations, reporting as well as maintenance and support of existing data projects.   This role is a great opportunity for someone who not only wants to solve problems (writing SQL will be a significant part of this role) but is also interested in being exposed to some exciting Data Science work with an opportunity to get more involved in this area over time.</p><p><b> Rotageek&nbsp;  </b></p><p>A few years ago, Rotageek was a small side project; our CEO, an A&amp;E doctor, wanted to improve scheduling in his hospital department. Today, we’re a software company leading the way in reinventing how employees are scheduled.   We’re helping some of the largest UK organisations move from paper and excel based rotas to intelligent and interactive schedules. In doing so, we’re helping employees gain more ownership over their hours - improving their work-life balance - whilst making sure that businesses improve how they run their operations. We use intelligent technology to make sure the right staff are in the right place at the right time, whilst making the process of creating, communicating and modifying a rota as easy as possible.</p><p><b>What we expect from our Junior Data Engineer<br></b></p><ul><li>You’ll be able to communicate with our clients to develop and support imports and exports from Rotageek</li><li>You’ll be able to easily create and edit custom reports so customers can view their data in different formats</li><li>You’ll work closely with our Customer Success team ensuring that everything is in place from a technical implementation perspective for rollouts and trials</li></ul> <br> <p><b> As the ideal candidate, you... </b></p><ul><li>Have experience working with SQL (plus if it is SQL Server)</li><li>Are familiar with the most common structured or delimited file formats (CSV, XML, JSON, etc) </li><li>Are familiar with data transfer methods (SFTP, HTTP, TCP, SOAP, REST, etc)</li><li>Ideally are familiar with ETL Tools and Python</li><li>Are eager to work for a high-growth tech company. It comes with lots of benefits and opportunities, but it’s not for everyone. </li></ul> <br> <p> Apply!  If you think this sounds like something you’d enjoy and excel at, we would love to hear from you!   To apply, please send us your CV and a short paragraph explaining why you think you’d make a great Junior Data Engineer to claire@rotageek.com  We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p> (We’re not looking to work with recruiters for this job posting so please only contact us if you’re a candidate wishing to apply - thank you!)   </p> ",

    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Software* *Engineer*<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />As Software Engineer you’ll be at the forefront of the next stage of the Switchee platform as enter an exciting period of growth. As a start-up this role will involve working in all areas of the platform: frontend, backend, data analytics and more.<br /><br />* Help design and implement scalable cloud-based solutions for the Switchee platform<br />* Creating internal and external API’s for our hardware, web apps and partners<br />* Developing responsive and engaging web applications<br />* Building out the next version of our real-time streaming analytics system<br />* Support the product team with user testing and development feedback<br />* Collaborate with our Firmware team to ensure our hardware and software work seamlessly<br /><br /><br />*Your* *Experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:<br /><br />* Experience working with IoT device<br />* Knowledge of Event sourcing and Domain Driven Design patterns<br />* Devops, infrastructure as code<br />* Containers and/or Serverless<br /><br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We occasionally work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter by clicking the button below.",
