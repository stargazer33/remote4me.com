Making mistakes in our business has direct effects on our clients' customers. We take both of these facts very seriously. At odds with this, Simon embraces the startup ethos of keeping lean and focused. We move quickly (continuous deployment) and emphasize experimentation to test hypotheses. To help us keep a high bar of quality, you'll bring a mindset for creativity and fault tolerance to your work every day.</p><p>Simon's engineering team is distributed across four states; we welcome engineers working at our New York City offices as well as remote employees.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability.</p><p>We'd love to meet you and learn more about your career goals.</p></div>"

    "content": "*ABOUT US*<br /><br />Do you want to build an exciting new brand in an industry ripe for a makeover?<br /><br />Join us on our mission.<br /><br />At Laka, we believe that traditional insurance fails to offer peace of mind. It’s an inconvenience people have to deal with – unpleasant, expensive and unfair. <br /><br />Laka has a new way to protect your favourite things in the world.<br /><br />What makes us truly different is that members of our community don’t pay a fixed premium every year, but only share the true cost of claims incurred by the community. Simple, but truly disruptive (Sorry for the D-word).<br /><br />The first thing we have chosen to insure are high-end bicycles. For that, we have assembled a community of real cyclists who protect each other's bikes against whatever happens. <br /><br />Every month Laka helps community members in need - when their gear is damaged or stolen. At the end of the month, all costs are split between the community, but each member’s premium is capped at market rate. Instead of paying hefty margins, our customers know they will always get the best price for great cover. <br /><br />Insurance that just works.<br /><br />We went from concept to regulated business with a live product in 12 months. On the way, we joined fantastic ecosystems such as Anthemis’ Fellowship program and  Startupbootcamp InsurTech, gathering a stellar host of business angels around us. <br /><br />You can be an integral part of the brilliant team taking the business from hundreds to thousands of customers. With our revolutionary approach to insurance, we have the opportunity to relentlessly challenge the status quo in insurance and build a brand which truly reflects our mission.  <br /><br />We’re currently a team of 7, so everyone is vitally important to our success. You’ll be working directly with the company founders and will get to experience life in a startup company as we scale! We encourage you to get involved with any aspect of the business you are interested in. T-shaped people are the best! <br /><br />Our office is in Oxford Circus, but we are flexible and understand sometimes you just need to work from home or wherever inspires you the most.<br /><br />The specifics (including the final title) of the role will vary depending on your experience, but in any case, it will grow with you. We want bright people to join us on our journey.<br /><br />*ABOUT YOU*<br /><br />Ideally, you can hit the ground running, have an interest in learning new things, and are comfortable working in a (constantly!) changing environment.<br /><br />You have an eye for design, and like to use this in solving both real world and technical problems. You are familiar with (at least some of) our current front-end stack: Javascript (ES6), React, Redux, GraphQL. <br />Most importantly you should be well versed with idiosyncrasies of HTML/CSS.<br /> <br />You have exposure to Git, and have worked in an agile environment. <br /><br />You must have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />*BONUS POINTS*<br /><br />- Full-stack or backend development experience (Node.js, MySQL, AWS). <br />- Experience designing/building Native mobile apps.<br />- Experience with (or interest in) AI and machine learning or data visualisation would be a plus (our internal systems are based on data science/ML processes).<br />- A passion for cycling!<br /><br />*OUR OFFER*<br /><br />- £20-50k annual salary (dependent on experience)<br />- Stock options: level depending on experience and expertise<br />- Flexible Holiday Policy<br />- Great working environment either in a Shared office space near Oxford Circus or a New Location in Bristol<br />- Flexible work arrangements: as long as the work gets done<br />- Generous Conference/Training budget<br />- Child-care vouchers<br />- Cycle to work scheme<br />- Regular team off-sites to collectively decide our future<br />- Weekly team lunch<br /><br />Above all: an opportunity to make a real impact in an archaic industry<br /><br />*THE PROCESS*<br /><br />We aim to reply to all applicants within a week of receiving your application. Our interview process will have of several stages, each allowing us getting to know you better, professionally and technically - and for you to understand our culture and ethos. <br /><br />The stages include: <br />-    CV and code sample/portfolio review<br />-    Coding Test<br />-    Phone / Video interview<br />-    Face to Face interview<br /><br />We hope to get all the above done within 2-3 weeks, depending on your availability and convenience."

Right now, we have a solid platform, are are looking to accelerate our Data Science offerings to detect and trend new types of attacks.   <br /><br />Based in the heart of Bristol, we have great connections with the Cyber community across the region, and our office is just 2 minutes from Bristol Temple Meads station.<br /><br />We have an Innovate UK grant to boost development, and are looking for the right team member to take our Data Science to the next level.  The ideal candidate should be smart and keen.  From a technical perspective, they should have at least 3 years of experience in the field of Data Science, preferably using Python-based toolsets.  However, we're 100% Agile, so are open to different approaches.  Experience working with distributed teams would be a bonus.<br /><br />Drop me a line if you're excited by the technical challenge and opportunity of working for LuJam Cyber!  "

We provide both the technology and services to enable our customers to not only take control of their data, but allow them to do amazing things with that control.</p><p>As part of that effort, we're changing the way that people do digital analytics by moving companies away from a one-size-fits-all mindset and enabling them to collect and own their data themselves.</p><p><strong>The Opportunity</strong></p><p>We’re looking for 2 open source Software Engineering Interns this Summer (May through August), for an 8-16 week paid internship, building on our previous successful Winter &amp; Summer internships.</p><p>Our interns work directly on and contribute to projects within the&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/snowplow' rel='nofollow'>Snowplow open source stack</a>. We have lots of ideas for cool projects to do around Snowplow - and if you have any suggestions of your own, we would love to hear them!</p><p>This is a paid internship; we will consider remote candidates who are up to UTC +/- 5 hours maximum. Most of our engineering team works remotely so you certainly won’t be the only one!</p><p><strong>Does this sound like you?</strong></p><p>A Snowplow intern loves coding, enjoys experimenting with new technologies and is happiest working “in the open” on community/team projects. In terms of programming languages, we’ be particularly interested in hearing from you if you love Scala or have experience with big data frameworks.</p><p>However, our stack consists of Scala, Golang, JavaScript, Objective-C, C#, Java, Python - so, whatever languages you like working in, we can probably find something interesting for you to do. Technologies and tools we use at Snowplow include Spark, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Kinesis and Redshift.</p><p><strong>To apply</strong></p><p>If you’re interested, please send in your CV along with a summary about a piece of software you are proud to have written.<strong>Here are some do’s for your application:</strong></p><ul><li>Do tell us a little bit about yourself - what you are passionate about, what you are looking for in an internship</li><li>Do share any public profiles or contributions you have on open-source, libre or community projects</li><li>Do share links to publically available code written by you (perhaps something on GitHub or Bitbucket?)</li><li>Do suggest specific projects/initiatives/features that you would like to work on in your internship (it’s okay if you don’t know!)</li></ul><p><strong>Some don’ts:</strong></p><ul><li>Please don’t share any proprietary or commercial software with us</li><li>Please don’t attach any code to your application (but it’s okay to tell us about code that you&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;share later on)</li></ul><p>And that’s it!

What we’re saying, essentially, is everyone has to start somewhere.<br /><br />So, this is a junior data analyst position. You won’t handle multimillion-worth clients, you won’t have your own office and you’ll be making your own coffee.<br /><br />But wait: did we mention the salary is up to £25,000 with benefits including remote working one or two days per week? that we’ll nurture you and train you up to be a top-drawer software engineer or data scientist? that we’ve been in business for over ten years, are firm believers in collaboration (talk to us about pair programming) and are a friendly, sociable bunch?<br /><br />If that sounds good - and we figure it does else you’d have stopped reading by now - let us introduce ourselves.<br /><br />We’re a market insight, business intelligence and analytics boutique. Our clients are demanding more data granularity and in-depth analytics than ever before, so you’ll need some basic SQL skills to begin with. There’s truckloads of terabytes to manipulate and make sense of. If you’re as savvy as Sherlock and as brave as Bear Grylls, you’ll be fine.<br /><br />Our core tech stack is the C# .NET MVC SQL Server ecosystem with side helpings of Azure, Angular and NodeJS. We’ve got a number of interesting IoT projects on the go which offer a chance to marry hardware and software. So this position is perfecto if you’re interested in connected devices and embedded programming.<br /><br />It's a small team, so we need you to be friendly and adaptable. There’ll be frequent interruptions and distractions – and, from time to time, we’ll want you working on stuff outside your regular role.<br /><br />So show us some of your achievements, tell us what makes you tick and why we need you on our side, and we’ll do our best to take you to the top.We look forward to hearing from you. And remember you don't fish without a hook. No CVs without a cover letter, please."
