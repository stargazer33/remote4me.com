If so, let’s talk!</p><p><strong>Please submit a resume and talk to us about your experience modeling systems – whether those systems are financial, mechanical, electrical, or anything else – using analysis and direct implementation in software.</strong></p><p>Here's what we're looking for:&nbsp;</p><ul>    <li>Ability to write well-structured, production level software</li>    <li>Fluency in Python and ability to model real-world physical systems</li></ul><p>We're also looking at:&nbsp;</p><ul>    <li>Prior experience:&nbsp; Master’s degree (most likely in a computer science, engineering or finance field) or 2 years of equivalent experience or a third path of your own; degree not important if you have equivalent practical experience; working with power grid, emissions and/ or energy data is a bonus!</li>    <li>Resourcefulness: you’re equally comfortable coming up with ways to make it work as you are asking for what you need</li>    <li>Growth mindset: if you don’t know the answer now, you’re excited to learn</li>    <li>Drive for impact: you do the boring work with as much attention and vigor as the fun stuff because you're motivated by moving our mission of choice forward</li>    <li>Collaborative, respectful team player: you ask questions, you seek out new information, you articulate complex points clearly and concisely, title doesn’t matter as much as the work you do</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ABOUT THE WORK</strong></p><ul>    <li>Join a small, committed team building and maintaining our core product, an API and software suite that provides historical and current power plant emissions. This involves: Python, ML/AI, satellite imagery, atmospheric chemistry datasets and real-time power grid operations.</li>    <li>Unlike some&nbsp;many engineering roles, this position will require building a strong mental model and software model of the underlying physical systems, and understanding the various&nbsp;real-world&nbsp;effects of a certain event.</li>    <li>Example&nbsp;project for this position: create plant-level dispatch models of expected power generation/emissions. This is a time-series problem of combining individual/instantaneous satellite measurements into an overall emissions estimate.</li>    <li>Collaborate and solve problems with a diverse team of analysts, engineers and project managers from WattTime, Google and partners.</li>    <li>Execute sound judgement and critical thinking.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LOGISTICS&nbsp;</strong></p><ul>    <li>WattTime headquarters in Oakland, CA.

We believe nothing has more potential for fast, world-changing impact, than software. We embrace change. We are lean and rapid prototypers. We never confuse growth with impact. We are all personally, fiercely committed to our mission. We are quietly radical in unexpected ways. We have allies, not competitors. We trust in data and everyone’s voice being heard. We know diversity is central to success. We consider respect non-negotiable: there are no jerks here.</p><p>We offer competitive benefits and professional development opportunities.</p><p>Unlike most startups, our team is backed by more than 300 volunteers who contributed to our founding and are happy to support us in terms of advice, networking and perspective.

We invented Automated Emissions Reduction (AER), which allows utilities, IoT device and energy storage companies, and any end user to effortlessly reduce emissions from energy, when and where they happen. Our cutting-edge insights and algorithms, coupled with machine learning, can shift the timing of flexible electricity use to sync with times of cleaner energy and avoid times of dirtier energy. We sell solutions that make it easy for anyone to achieve emissions reductions without compromising cost and user experience. WattTime was founded by PhD researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and in 2017 became a subsidiary of Rocky Mountain Institute.</p><p></p>                      <h4>Desired Skills</h4>            <ul>                              <li><span>Artificial Intelligence</span></li>                              <li><span>Big Data</span></li>                              <li><span>Machine Learning</span></li>                          </ul>                                <h4>How to Apply</h4>            <p></p><p>Apply directly to the position via the link provided</p><p></p>                                <h4>Contact Info</h4>            <ul>              <li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Arden Childers</li>              <li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href='mailto:arden@watttime.org' rel='nofollow'>arden@watttime.org</a></li>              <li><strong>Company Website:</strong> <a href='https://www.watttime.org/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.watttime.org/</a></li>            </ul>                  </div><a href='https://www.watttime.org/news/watttime-is-hiring-join-us-in-making-global-clean-energy-choice-a-reality/' rel='nofollow'>Apply</a>",

We’re hiring for a number of roles, like VP Engineering, Backend Engineer, Data Engineer, DevOps Engineer, and Security Engineer. Our goal is to make access to primary care as easy as googling something, without needing to make a financial tradeoff. We were seeing exciting growth before COVID-19 and that growth has accelerated even more as we help support the response to this global pandemic in the US. Some quick mentions of the technology we’re using: all our infra is in AWS, IaC using CDK (and some Terraform), Typescript, Kotlin, DynamoDB, and PostgreSQL. We are usually ONSITE in the office. During COVID-19, we are fully remote. Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>",

And, we appreciate that you do not want to waste your time either. So, as part of your application we ask you to write a Conducto pipeline. This serves the dual purpose of allowing us to see an example of your coding, and it gives you a chance to see if Conducto is a tool that you are excited to work on. We will be looking for clean and elegant code that generates an interesting pipeline. Supply the URL of a public git repository with your pipeline code in the application. Make sure your repo includes a README detailing how to run your pipeline.\\n\\nSuggested topics:\\n\\n\\n* Write a data pipeline.\\n\\n* Parallelize an algorithm.\\n\\n* Code any CI/CD pipeline.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou do not have to follow these suggestions; feel free to be creative.  </div> </div>",

You know both the art&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;science of analytics - not only do you know how to find answers in the data, you also know which questions should be asked in the first place and what data can help us further bolster our conclusions. You love engaging with customers, learning about their challenges and then diving into the data to see how to solve them!</p><p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborative.&nbsp;</strong>You know that your colleagues’ perspectives will make our customers successful. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together. You propose ways for us to be more engaged and successful with our customers.</li><li><strong>Customer focused</strong>.

You are self driven, you take direction well but are able to be creative to find results on your own when asked. You are driven to succeed because your hard work and results make you proud.</li><li><strong>Disciplined and reliable.</strong>&nbsp; We are a distributed company and you enjoy the benefits of working distributed while consistently delivering what you have committed to.

You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</li><li><strong>Work smarter and harder.</strong>&nbsp;You often identify a problem, create a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own.&nbsp; You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful.</li></ul><p><strong>Crisp’s Data Science Tech Stack</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Modern libraries and frameworks</strong>.&nbsp; We use Python with Pandas and Numpy for data science in production.&nbsp; We use technologies like Jupyter and R during EDA.</li><li><strong>Diverse technologies and algorithms, solving real world problems.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;At Crisp you’ll work with a wide range of technologies and algorithms on a daily basis, in a focused effort to solve large scale problems.</li><li><strong>Continuous deployment.</strong>&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</li><li><strong>Cloud first.</strong>&nbsp;As a services offering in the 21st century, the cloud isn’t the future, it’s the present. We’re fully invested in using the features offered by our cloud provider in order to minimize technical debt and maximize productivity.</li><li><strong>Micro-services.</strong>&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.</li><li><strong>Start-up mode.</strong>&nbsp; The team is still small, and the product is fresh.&nbsp; You’ll be able to exert a large amount of influence, and contribute to decisions that will determine the future of the product and the team.</li></ul><p>We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products.

We own and operate The Hollywood Gossip, TV Fanatic and Food Fanatic, which launched in 2013 and marked a turning point in our relationship with publishers and the advertising industry.</p><p>With the inception of Food Fanatic, we learned from our contributors that when it comes to frustrations with the way most ad networks operate, we weren’t alone. We wanted to do better and put control back into the hands of the publishers.</p><p>Networks typically treat publishers as if they, and the advertisers, are the only ones with value, dictating how publishers should run their sites, how they should handle advertising, and how they should be paid in a one-sided relationship.</p><p>We’re changing that. After pioneering new ad tech strategies allowing our own sites to thrive like never before, a few Food Fanatic contributors asked us if we could do better for them too. From that point forward, Mediavine was born.</p><p>Mediavine is privately owned, with no outside investors. We answer to our publishers and our ad partners, making us the most agile company in this space. We’re founded by publishers, owned by publishers, and ready to help you navigate the future of ads as a publisher yourself.</p>            </div>        ",

We want to enable organizations to harness the power of data<br><br></div><div>to realize their boldest ideas, much faster, and with greater efficiency than ever before - all without any data engineering.<br><br></div><div>Our goal is to deploy and operate high performance computing infrastructure so customers don't have to. That’s why we’re building next-generation tools like Wallaroo, a highly efficient stream-processing engine that scales to volumes that traditional big data solutions can’t.<br><br></div><div>Our technology runs as a service inside a client’s own environment, whether in any cloud, on-premise, or at the edge, and plays nicely with modern data, messaging, analytics, and machine learning ecosystems.<br><br></div><div>We believe this is a $40B+ market opportunity and we aim to take a good chunk of it. We’re a seed-stage company that’s raised $6M from some of the best enterprise software investors in NYC, and we’re looking for ambitious people to grow our team and our business, enhance our culture, and contribute great ideas.<br><br></div><div><strong>The Position<br></strong><br></div><div>We believe in hiring strong engineers and letting them apply their unique skills and experiences to make our team and product better. That said, there are a few must-have requirements that are needed to do well in our environment. Beyond those, we are looking for candidates who have skills that draw from our &quot;nice to have qualifications&quot; list.<br><br></div><div>Requirements:<br><br></div><ul><li>Experience building high-volume data processing applications</li><li>Experience deploying and running production systems at scale</li><li>Experience analyzing and improving system performance</li><li>Experience developing software and deployment systems for AWS or other cloud providers</li><li>Experience developing on *Nix system (shell, scripts, tools, etc) with version control (e.g. git)</li><li>Self-motivated and able to work both independently and collaboratively</li><li>Excellent written and verbal skills, and good at async communication</li><li>A self-guided learner with the ability to pick up new skills and languages quickly</li><li>Desire to help those around you grow and learn from you</li><li>Thrive in an environment where the long-term goal remains stable but day-to-day needs may change quickly</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Nice to Have Qualifications:<br><br></div><ul><li>Experience running production systems</li><li>Prior experience working with customers either external or business-oriented</li><li>Experience working with/designing/building distributed systems</li><li>Experience developing multi-threaded programs</li><li>Experience using a &quot;strongly typed&quot; language</li><li>Experience developing compilers</li><li>Experience with supporting running systems</li><li>Experience with infrastructure-as-code systems (Ansible, Terraform, Pulimi, etc)</li><li>Experience analyzing system performance</li><li>Experience developing for AWS or other cloud systems</li><li>Excellent teaching skills</li><li>Strong algorithmic and mathematical skills</li><li>Strong understanding of memory management (manual memory management, garbage collection)</li><li>Familiarity with open-source streaming data and message queuing technologies</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Engineering Values<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>Distributed First<ul><li>We are a fully distributed team with a base of operations in NYC and engineers ranging from California to the Netherlands. Our processes are always distributed first, with an emphasis on effective asynchronous communication.</li></ul></li><li>Communication<ul><li>One of our mottos is: “If it wasn’t communicated, it didn’t happen.” Communication is always crucial to effective collaboration, but in a distributed setting it becomes even more important.</li><li>Email, text chat, and documentation are important tools to communicate across time zones and geography. Voice conferences bring us together despite working in different countries.</li><li>We bring up concerns early, and share objectives, context and work progress in public. We value clarity and making assumptions explicit.</li></ul></li><li>Lifelong Learning<ul><li>We value a commitment to learning, and see the ability to quickly get up to speed on new languages, technologies, and ideas as just as important as specialized knowledge, if not more. We stress a growth mindset, and know that listening can take effort but is crucial to understanding.</li></ul></li><li>Self-motivation and Accountability<ul><li>Our engineers excel at working independently and flexibly collaborating with the right people for the job. We proactively get involved when help is needed.</li></ul></li><li>Respect and Openness<ul><li>We know that we’re working with human beings with their own lives, concerns, and perspectives. We strive for charitable interpretation and empathy. We value constructive disagreement and challenging assumptions, but only when this is done with respect. We realize that even if you are an expert in some area, you can still learn from the fresh perspectives of novices, which means humility is not only reasonable, but essential to overcoming blind spots.</li></ul></li><li>The Right Tool for the Job<ul><li>We know that in software engineering, there are no silver bullets. No language, framework, tool, or process is “The One, True Way”. We look for the right tool for the job, and depending on the circumstances, this may or may not be Wallaroo!</li></ul></li><li>Adaptability<ul><li>Our engineers have to be ready to adapt to changing circumstances and temporarily take on roles that might be a bit outside their job description. We value comfort with uncertainty and an openness to experimentation.</li></ul></li><li>Everyone a Teacher<ul><li>In a smaller startup, we need everyone to be a generalist to some degree. That’s part of the reason we value sharing knowledge, skills, and perspectives so much. Our engineers are eager to keep learning, but they’re also eager to teach their colleagues what they know, and to experiment with more effective ways to make this kind of information readily available.</li></ul></li></ul><div><br></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity in our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.<br><br></div><div><br></div></div>",

Unemployment has thus far doubled, with more people furloughed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Larks connects these two audiences by creating a marketplace that offers online social activities supplied by the community.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Our vision</strong></p><br /><p>Imagine a world where anyone interested in taking part in a club, activity or learning a new skill could do so easily from home. From cooking, reading, knitting, photography, nutrition and many more, you can invite existing friends to join your experience or make new friends through shared passions.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Imagine being able to launch a new activity or club centred around your passion, and make money out of it from home. The scope is enormous, the market in the millions and impact on people's mental and social well-being profoundly positive. There is currently no single place for people to easily find relevant and engaging online social activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Most online activity marketplaces are based around face to face activities, online there are many streamed instructional videos but few interactive experiences where you can genuinely engage with others. Larks is the first marketplace that makes it easy to list and find online, community-lead social activities.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>This is an opportunity to work on a greenfield project in an industry that is undergoing sector re-defining changes as we speak. Millions of people are socialising differently and have been forced to change their mindsets around online interactions and what it means to be part of a community. We&rsquo;re building the first home of online activities and communities as demand sky-rockets. This is an opportunity to join at the beginning and be a key part of an exciting and fast-growing project. We&rsquo;re an experienced team, working remotely with a strong culture. We have a large network of activity providers and have spotted this gap in the market through testing a live and successful MVP.</p><br /><p><strong>About you&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;re a talented software engineer with over 5 years of development experience at high-growth tech start-ups. You&rsquo;ve ideally been part of the development team in a marketplace business. You are passionate about our mission of building online communities and excited about how early-stage we are.</p><br /><p>There&rsquo;s some flexibility around how the role could be structured depending on experience and availability.</p><br /><p><strong>Apply</strong></p><br /><p>Apply with a link to your Linked in profile (or a CV) and a brief note to explain why you&rsquo;re interested in this opportunity.</p>",

We are a team of multinational people with various domain of expertise ranging from business, to data science, to logistics, to software development, to finance… A nice blend of domain and technology expertise.</p><p><strong>CEL is putting together a full product team to create a ground breaking Simulation As A Service offer that will deeply impact the supply chain industry.</strong></p><p><em>Why is Supply Chain important?</em></p><p>Take a second and look around you - everything you see has came to you through a supply chain, starting from a natural resource into your home through hundreds of activities more or less coordinated so you have what you want when you want.</p><p>So Supply Chain is everything of the physical world. Without supply chains, there are no businesses, no jobs, no buildings, no economy, nothing.</p><p>So we think that it’s kind of important.</p><p>After 15 years of working with hundred of companies that make and distribute their products (from milk to shoes, from furniture to cement, from electronics to vegetables….) we have came to a simple conclusion: it is too complex for people to operate properly. Current IT system, organisation, processes actually don’t help much. All these networks of flows are inherently inefficient.</p><p>Why? Complexity. No human brain is capable to comprehend the actual dynamics of such complex systems. No IT tool, no ERP, no fancy solution is actually taking a holistic view of the problem, instead each of these focus on improving small pieces.</p><p>The result? massive wastes of resources, enormous amount of inventory, unnecessary impact on the environment… and ultimately rare are the cases when supply actually meets demand, creating massive systemic effect and rather low customer satisfaction. Pure waste.</p><p>So we decided to really do something about it.</p><p>We are currently developing a product that that combines technologies like Data Science, Simulation Modelling, Cloud computing - backed up with years of business experience - to help companies actually assess what their future could look like and figure out what alternatives exist.</p><p>To replace the common approach of guessing what could happen, we are aiming at answering “What if” questions in an easy, sexy and fast manner.</p><p>Imagine you could simulate various scenario of your own future, would your life decisions be better? Most likely!</p><p>If the challenge is of interest to you, if you are keen to understand how product-driven businesses actually works, if you are willing to make full use of your systemic thinking and bridge the gap between the physical and virtual world, and if you have the competencies we are after, then we may pretty much want to work together to change the world!</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shares and revenu shares</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full remote possible</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team trips to Vietnam (head office)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly team retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Cross field product with a huge disruption potential</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We are a team of multinational people with various domain of expertise ranging from business, to data science, to logistics, to software development, to finance… A nice blend of domain and technology expertise.</p><p><strong>CEL is putting together a full product team to create a ground breaking Simulation As A Service offer that will deeply impact the supply chain industry.</strong></p><p><em>Why is Supply Chain important?</em></p><p>Take a second and look around you - everything you see has came to you through a supply chain, starting from a natural resource into your home through hundreds of activities more or less coordinated so you have what you want when you want.</p><p>So Supply Chain is everything of the physical world. Without supply chains, there are no businesses, no jobs, no buildings, no economy, nothing.</p><p>So we think that it’s kind of important.</p><p>After 15 years of working with hundred of companies that make and distribute their products (from milk to shoes, from furniture to cement, from electronics to vegetables….) we have came to a simple conclusion: it is too complex for people to operate properly. Current IT system, organisation, processes actually don’t help much. All these networks of flows are inherently inefficient.</p><p>Why? Complexity. No human brain is capable to comprehend the actual dynamics of such complex systems. No IT tool, no ERP, no fancy solution is actually taking a holistic view of the problem, instead each of these focus on improving small pieces.</p><p>The result? massive wastes of resources, enormous amount of inventory, unnecessary impact on the environment… and ultimately rare are the cases when supply actually meets demand, creating massive systemic effect and rather low customer satisfaction. Pure waste.</p><p>So we decided to really do something about it.</p><p>We are currently developing a product that that combines technologies like Data Science, Simulation Modelling, Cloud computing - backed up with years of business experience - to help companies actually assess what their future could look like and figure out what alternatives exist.</p><p>To replace the common approach of guessing what could happen, we are aiming at answering “What if” questions in an easy, sexy and fast manner.</p><p>Imagine you could simulate various scenario of your own future, would your life decisions be better? Most likely!</p><p>If the challenge is of interest to you, if you are keen to understand how product-driven businesses actually works, if you are willing to make full use of your systemic thinking and bridge the gap between the physical and virtual world, and if you have the competencies we are after, then we may pretty much want to work together to change the world!</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shares and revenu shares</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full remote possible</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team trips to Vietnam (head office)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly team retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Cross field product with a huge disruption potential</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
