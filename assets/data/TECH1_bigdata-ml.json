It will feel as fluid and natural as it does to text or call someone today, but even more personal and human .</p><p>This reality is still a way off, but we’re super excited to start building it now through simple and delightful video-focused products.</p><p>To help us get there, we’re looking for a Software Engineer of Infrastructure who is excited to help our engineering teams solve challenging problems.</p><p><strong>As an infrastructure software engineer at Wistia, you can expect to lead projects such as the following.</strong></p><ul><li>Improve our in-house deployment platform by having it expose access to new Kubernetes options or more effectively use Kubernetes primitives, or finding ways to make our Jenkins-based CI system more pleasant to use for other engineers</li><li>Gather feedback from colleagues to identify workflow frictions or architectural problems across our codebases and advise and assist with improvements, such as by measuring the current load of different pieces of a system, identifying problem libraries or other system components and suggesting a solution or vetting a replacement, or planning out the steps of a complex refactoring across services.</li><li>Make a manual infrastructure operation more automatic or declarative, e.g. by building a tool to sync our DNS zones from a source-controlled config file or by writing a bot to show us output in new infrastructure pull requests</li><li>Advise our application development teams on how best to architect a new feature, including evaluating a datastore for a particular new workload, designing data flows to keep app containers stateless, deciding how to best employ AWS primitives, and identifying and avoiding single points of failure</li><li>Improve observability across our Rails and Elixir codebases and Linux hosts via logging and instrumentation, identify performance bottlenecks across systems, and recommend configuration or application design improvements to handle growing system scale</li><li>Update our Chef recipes to be compatible with new software versions or to apply security patches, bake the updates into new VM images, and roll out new images to all our clusters</li></ul><p>We are looking for someone who is excited to support our engineering colleagues on other teams and flexible enough to work at any level of our stack. We won’t expect you to know all the tools we use on your first day, as long as you’re eager to learn and you thrive working collaboratively. We’re a small team, so we will also value experiences and skillsets that complement our existing strengths.</p><p><strong>Here are some qualities we look for in Wistia engineers, and why we feel they’re so important:</strong></p><ul><li>Learn continuously. We’re constantly faced with the unknown at Wistia. We won’t expect you to have an answer ready for every question, but we value the ability to quickly learn new technologies as you go.</li><li>Collaborate often. Whether through pair programming, a whiteboard session, or a casual lunch conversation, collaboration helps the best ideas and practices to proliferate.</li><li>Communicate effectively. Our work routinely affects our customers, their viewers, and other Wistians. Whether gathering feedback on a design proposal, updating colleagues on a project’s progress, pairing on a tough problem, or writing documentation, it is critical our communication be clear and concise to reach a shared vision.</li><li>Show empathy for colleagues. We value our colleagues more than our code. Being respectful, leaving space for others, and trying to understand someone else’s perspective instead of just defending your own are all critical to maintaining a team where everyone can feel included and empowered to do their best work.</li><li>Write clean and understandable code. We write code for each other and for our future selves. Code that is clear and tested sets us up for speed, reliability, and a more enjoyable development experience.</li><li>Navigate complex trade-offs. Most hard decisions involve trade-offs. Do we want our distributed database to be more consistent, or more available? Should we use a hosted product that will save us time now, but force us to move to a new system in a year? These are regular conversations!</li><li>Think for yourself. We hire people because we value their unique thoughts, insights and experiences. These things matter a great deal more to us than conventional wisdom or herd mentalities in technical communities.</li><li>Strive for simplicity<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Blaise Pascal once wrote, “I’m sorry I wrote you such a long letter; I didn’t have time to write a short one.” Making things simple and elegant is deceptively difficult, but it’s worth the effort because the result is easier to understand and work with.</li></ul><p>We’re profitable, growing, and independent of venture funding, so we have the luxury of being able to invest in whatever will best serve the long-term value of the company. We know the biggest investment we can make is in our employees, so we provide:</p><ul><li>A competitive salary</li><li>401k with 3% company contribution, regardless of whether you make contributions</li><li><strong>Flexible hours</strong></li><li>Fully paid healthcare, dental and vision coverage for you and your family and a healthcare FSA</li><li>Up to 12 weeks paid family leave</li><li>Untracked vacation and sick leave (most employees take about four weeks of vacation)</li><li>Transportation subsidies</li><li>Financial support for continuing education, professional development and sponsorship for conferences</li><li>A convenient office just south of Central Square in Cambridge, MA. We’re right on the Red Line, surrounded by great restaurants, parks, and even a dog park.</li></ul><p>We are working hard to make Wistia an inclusive and diverse place where everyone feels happy, fulfilled, respected, comfortable, and welcome. We want you to have fun here! Come join us and let’s build really cool things together.</p><p><strong>This role is open to local candidates based out of our Cambridge, MA office or remote candidates authorized to work in the US</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Remote candidates must have prior experience working successfully on a distributed team, as the role is for a fully distributed team within our mixed remote &amp; in-office Engineering department.</strong></p><p>If you would like to apply, please link or upload any resources that will help us understand your background and your strengths.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/wistia/jobs/1323870' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

As part of that effort, we're changing the way that people do digital analytics: moving companies away from having one-size-fits-all vendors like Google Analytics and Adobe dictate what should be done with their data, and enabling them to collect and own their data themselves, so they can decide:<br /><br />What data they want to collect.<br />What questions they want to ask of that data.<br />How they want to answer those question. (What analyses techniques to employ, what tools to use to execute those analyses.)<br />How they want to action the insight developed.<br /><br />We're looking for curiously brilliant individuals to join our Sales & Implementation Engineering team.<br /><br />What the role entails:<br /><br />The Sales & Implementation Engineering team at Snowplow helps companies take control of their data, enabling them to solve problems that previously were intractable and identify opportunities that previously were not visible.<br /><br />As a member of the Sales & Implementation Engineering team, you will:<br />help our clients understand what data needs to be captured, advise them on how to best structure it, and help them implement the tracking;<br />work with our clients to take their Snowplow data and use it to build insights and design and build data driven products;<br />train our clients in our methodology and approach, including how to best use the different tools in the Snowplow arsenal;<br />write blog posts and guides to help the broader Snowplow and Digital Analytics communities;<br /><br />You'll learn how to:<br />set up and run event data pipelines;<br />best structure data so it can easily be used for analysis and real-time decisioning;<br />architect data models (both relational and non-relational) and implement them in SQL and Spark;<br />access the data in databases (Redshift, Snowflake, BigQuery, neo4J, ...) and real-time (Elasticsearch, Kinesis, Lambda, ...);<br />use modern data analysis tools (Python, Spark, ...)<br />set up and use BI tools (Redash, Metabase, Superset, Looker, Tableau, ...);<br />use data to solve actual business problems;<br />and much more...<br /><br />You'll get an on-the-job training in digital analytics and an opportunity to work with some of the most data-sophisticated companies in the world.

We won’t expect you to know all the tools we use on your first day, as long as you’re eager to learn and you thrive working collaboratively. We’re a small team, so we will also value experiences and skillsets that complement our existing strengths.</p><p>Here are some&nbsp;, and why we feel they’re so important:</p><strong>qualities we look for in Wistia engineers</strong><ul></ul><li>We’re constantly faced with the unknown at Wistia. We won’t expect you to have an answer ready for every question, but we value the ability to quickly learn new technologies as you go.</li><strong>Learn continuously.&nbsp;</strong><li>&nbsp;Whether through pair programming, a whiteboard session, or a casual lunch conversation, collaboration helps the best ideas and practices to proliferate.</li><strong>Collaborate often.</strong><li>Our work routinely affects our customers, their viewers, and other Wistians. Whether gathering feedback on a design proposal, updating colleagues on a project’s progress, pairing on a tough problem, or writing documentation, it is critical our communication be clear and concise to reach a shared vision.</li><strong>Communicate effectively.&nbsp;</strong><li>&nbsp;We value our colleagues more than our code. Being respectful, leaving space for others, and trying to understand someone else’s perspective instead of just defending your own are all critical to maintaining a team where everyone can feel included and empowered to do their best work.</li><strong>Show empathy for colleagues.</strong><li>&nbsp;We write code for each other and for our future selves. Code that is clear and tested sets us up for speed, reliability, and a more enjoyable development experience.</li><strong>Write clean and understandable code.</strong><li>&nbsp;Most hard decisions involve trade-offs. Do we want our distributed database to be more consistent, or more available? Should we use a hosted product that will save us time now, but force us to move to a new system in a year? These are regular conversations!</li><strong>Navigate complex trade-offs.</strong><li>&nbsp;We hire people because we value their unique thoughts, insights and experiences. These things matter a great deal more to us than conventional wisdom or herd mentalities in technical communities.</li><strong>Think for yourself.</strong><li>&nbsp;Blaise Pascal once wrote, “I’m sorry I wrote you such a long letter; I didn’t have time to write a short one.” Making things simple and elegant is deceptively difficult, but it’s worth the effort because the result is easier to understand and work with.</li><strong>Strive for simplicity.</strong><p>We’re profitable, growing, and&nbsp;, so we have the luxury of being able to invest in whatever will best serve the long-term value of the company.

This includes everything from running A/B tests with statistical rigor to forecasting revenue for the year to tracing performance problems to analyzing usage patterns.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for an experienced candidate who’s done similar work elsewhere, but&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fm.signalvnoise.com%2Fnobody-hits-the-ground-running-ae4d8fd0e7de' rel='nofollow'>nobody hits the ground running</a>. You won’t be able to answer every question immediately or know how all the systems work on day one – and we don’t expect you to.</div><div><br></div><div>We want strong, diverse teams built from different backgrounds, experiences and identities. We’re ready for the ongoing work that goes into building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best work of your career. That starts with working no more than 40 hours a week on a regular basis and getting 8+ hours of sleep a night. Our workplace and our benefits are designed to support a sustainable, healthy relationship with your work.</div><div><br></div><div>Today, our team works from 32 different cities spread across 6 countries. You can work from anywhere in the world, so long as your normal working day has 4 hours or more overlap with Chicago time (CST/UTC-6). Nomads welcome.</div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><b>About the Job</b></div><div><br></div><div>Data informs almost everything we do at Basecamp, but we’re not a “data-driven organization” in the sense that data dictates decisions. Data is there to clear the head, but ultimately we drive the company with our heart.</div><div><br></div><div>This means the job isn’t about maximizing revenue or minimizing costs. Yes, we want to make money and we don’t want to be wasteful, but we also want to be kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. You won’t be looking for ways to squeeze the last sour drop out of the lemon at Basecamp.</div><div><br></div><div>But you will help us make sense of the data. Establish the facts. Put a price on the choices we make. Help us understand the business, our software, and its customers.</div><div><br></div><div>Here are some examples of projects you might work on:</div><ol><li>Analyzing the performance of a new marketing page. Track the cohort that signed up with this variation. Keep us patient for a statistically significant result. Compute the value of the change.</li><li>Identify when a brute-force login attack started, quarantine the IP addresses involved, work with technical operations to bolster our defenses, and write up the forensics report at the end.</li><li>Analyze our purchase records to locate transactions within states that are starting to collect sales tax on software like ours, work with our accounting company to document that sourcing method, and help evaluate whether we should buy or build a sales-tax engine.</li><li>Help product strategy analyze usage data to figure out whether a certain feature is working as intended, and if it is, who it’s important to.</li><li>Illuminate how we’re spending money on cloud computing today, and estimate how much we’ll be spending next year, given our growth patterns.</li><li>Answer the question: Has Basecamp 3 gotten slower in the last 6 months? Compare aggregate performance data to find the high-level trends, then help us pinpoint data tipping points or code regressions.</li></ol><div>Answering these questions usually means formulating and running queries against our big data infrastructure. But it also means just doing the basic math, and ensuring we’re being statistically rigorous. You should be able to do both the technical and statistical work to answer questions like the ones in the examples above.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s a lot of different areas of responsibility! So you probably won’t be an expert in all of them, and that’s fine. A solid fundamental approach to analysis will pave the way.</div><div><br></div><div>And you’ll have plenty of help! Basecamp has a Security, Infrastructure, and Performance (SIP) group that’s responsible for managing the data pipeline, storage, and analytical interfaces. And a Operations (Ops) group that’s responsible for running our servers, network, and cloud services. It’s a plus if you’re able to help evolve these systems, but by no means a requirement.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>About You</strong></div><div><br></div><div>In broad strokes,&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fsignalvnoise.com%2Fposts%2F1430-hire-managers-of-one' rel='nofollow'>Managers of One</a>&nbsp;thrive at Basecamp. We’re committed generalists, eager learners, conscientious workers, and curators of what’s essential. We’re quick to trust. We see things through. We’re kind to each other, look up to each other, and support each other. We achieve together. We are colleagues, here to do our best work.</div><div><br></div><div>You'll probably have a degree that has exposed you to the rigor of the analytical work. Social scientists welcome. If you don't have a degree in Theoretical Statistics, that's not a showstopper—and it's not what we're looking for, anyway! We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got there.</div><div><br></div><div>While we currently have an office in Chicago, you should be comfortable working remotely – most of the company does! This means that the bulk of our work is written, whether that be in the form of long reports or short chats. We value good writers.</div><div><br></div><div>We also value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous debate, but all remember that we’re here for the same purpose: to do good work together.

This comes to a range at hiring of between $115,000 and $141,000, depending on your seniority and experience. No matter where you live. Plus, with two years under your belt, you’ll participate in our profit-growth sharing program.</div><div><br></div><div>Our benefits at Basecamp are all about helping you lead a healthy life away from work. While we have a lovely office in Chicago, it’s not where you’ll find foosball tables constantly spinning, paid lunches, or any of the other trappings that companies use to lure employees into staying ever longer at work.</div><div><br></div><div>Work can wait. Our benefits include 4-day Summer Weeks, a yearly paid vacation, a one-month sabbatical every three years, and allowances for CSA, fitness, massage, and continuing education. We have top-shelf health insurance and a retirement plan with a generous match.&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbasecamp%2Fhandbook%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fbenefits-and-perks.md%23benefits--perks' rel='nofollow'>See the full list</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How To Apply</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Please&nbsp;<a href='https://basecamp.workable.com/jobs/825115' rel='nofollow'>send an application</a>&nbsp;tailored to this position that speaks to us.

We’re pragmatic crafters who believe in smart and focused development, building clients’ products just as we do our own: investing heavily in design, iterating rapidly to validate and falsify ideas, and pursuing perfection in every interaction. We learned a lot of interesting things along the way about the right way to ship software, and we're now bringing our incredible software product experience to larger companies like&nbsp;<strong>Verizon, Google, Intel, Twitter, Sony, L'Oréal</strong>— and we do this all with a fully distributed team.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that well-made software can change the world, no matter how small or simple a product might be. We also believe that poorly-made software —badly-designed, badly-developed, or badly-supported— is a preventable tragedy.</div><div><br></div><div>Mokriya’s mission is to make great software: for ourselves, for our clients and most importantly for our users.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>About You</strong></div><div>You love to build. When you're not at your job, you're probably tinkering on some contraption in the basement or figuring out how to take apart &lt;insert-something-you-bought-recently&gt;.

It’s fun to work at Mokriya because beyond the perks and good times, we’re a happy team of people who love to design and build great products. It’s not just that we have a great organizational structure in which everyone is really empowered to act; it’s also that we hire for fit and bring in folks only if we’re confident in their integrity, capability, and drive.</div><div><br></div><div>No one will watch over your shoulder, and you won't have to spend time watching over anyone else's either. We’re a talented team of doers. There’s little bureaucracy, and we hate blocking. Our product managers spend their time making sure you can get things done in the way that best suits your preferences and the project needs.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Autonomy, creativity, thoughtfulness, trust</strong>: if you care about those things, you'll be happy here.

The strength of our business model is that it incentivises consumers, advertisers and our retailer distribution network to not just personally gain, but also collaborate on utilising the value of our platform to solve wider social, environmental and economic problems facing us all.

    "content": "We won’t lie. You will hear “What’s my login?” one trillion times, and you will have to say, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” with a straight face.<br /> <br />It’s not rocket science, which is why this helpdesk support role pays 30k not 300k, but we’ll throw in contributions to gym membership and a share of your first year’s new orders revenue.<br /> <br />You’ll be dealing with clients’ issues, from the first ticket to resolution. And, of course, you’ll be dealing with dummies who think toolkits are what Dad keeps in the garage, and who don’t know networks from nachos. That’s pretty much all you’ll do, day in, day out, so if you’d rather eat your own face than be polite to people every damn day, stop reading.<br /> <br />Still here? Cool. We also need you to document every step. So explain stuff to clients, and write it down. Officially, this is “retaining system knowledge”. Really it’s so when someone deletes the wrong thing and plunges of Europe into darkness, you can prove you didn’t tell ’em to do it.<br /> <br />To sum up so far:<br /><br />• Answer the damn phone or email, log the damn tickets and help the damn client.<br /><br />• Don’t swear or say stuff like “hybrid cloud” unless you want to freak them out.<br /><br />• Prioritise. If someone says, “I’ve deleted the wrong thing and plunged half of Europe into darkness,” put ’em ahead of someone whose Instagram is freezing.<br /><br />• Pass the buck. No, really. If you can’t resolve the issue, escalate it to Sales, Accounts, Management or upper line support. None of them will thank you for this, so buy them drinks when we go out, even though all of them will be paid more than you.<br /><br />• Maintain a knowledge base and suggest ideas for improvement. Keep these work-related for the probation period, then try asking for at-desk massages and in-house baristas. You won’t get them, but it’ll be slightly harder for us to fire you.<br /> <br />Don’t bother applying unless you have, or can convincingly lie about having:<br /><br />• one year’s experience on a technical and client-focused support desk.<br /><br />• one year’s customer service experience in any sector.<br /><br />• a logical approach to resolving functional and technical issues.<br /><br />• the ability to assess and document client issues, user experiences and processes.<br /><br />• a professional phone and email manner.<br /><br />• the ability to talk to people at different levels, with diverse backgrounds, without sighing or asking if they were dropped on their head as a baby.<br /><br />• experience of being accountable in a small team and the ability to work independently.<br /><br />• understanding of data protection and compliance principles, namely GDPR.<br /> <br />We need you to be organized, systematic, a good communicator, a problem-solver, proactive, reliable and able to prioritise. You need to know the Microsoft Office suite too – but, let’s face it, even your grandma can work Outlook, Word and Excel these days.<br /> <br />If you can do all that, you’re halfway through the door. If you can do all that, and you have experience of MS SharePoint (2010 and 2013), Zendesk, Targetprocess, remote assistance software and support portals, and conceptualising system frameworks and impacts, maybe those massages and baristas will happen.*<br /><br />*They won’t.<br /><br />Interested? please send us a CV and be sure to include a covering letter. That's right you don't go fishing without a hook. We look forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />P.S. disclaimer time... we don't really think of end users as dummies - that was just parody.",

Of course there’s plenty of flexibility and lots of opportunities to grow, but we also have share options, private health insurance, and unlimited leave (with a minimum of 5.6 weeks per year - just so everyone actually takes time off). Our CEO is (really) devoted to making Rotageek the best place to work, and so while we work really, really hard, we definitely play hard, too. And we have nice snacks, good beer, amazing team events and a roof terrace.</p><p><b>Your role&nbsp;</b></p><p>We’re looking for someone who will work closely with our Data Science/Engineering teams to maintain operational and reporting data processes for our clients. You’ll be responsible for importing and exporting data from our databases, data migrations, reporting as well as maintenance and support of existing data projects.   This role is a great opportunity for someone who not only wants to solve problems (writing SQL will be a significant part of this role) but is also interested in being exposed to some exciting Data Science work with an opportunity to get more involved in this area over time.</p><p><b> Rotageek&nbsp;  </b></p><p>A few years ago, Rotageek was a small side project; our CEO, an A&amp;E doctor, wanted to improve scheduling in his hospital department. Today, we’re a software company leading the way in reinventing how employees are scheduled.   We’re helping some of the largest UK organisations move from paper and excel based rotas to intelligent and interactive schedules. In doing so, we’re helping employees gain more ownership over their hours - improving their work-life balance - whilst making sure that businesses improve how they run their operations. We use intelligent technology to make sure the right staff are in the right place at the right time, whilst making the process of creating, communicating and modifying a rota as easy as possible.</p><p><b>What we expect from our Junior Data Engineer<br></b></p><ul><li>You’ll be able to communicate with our clients to develop and support imports and exports from Rotageek</li><li>You’ll be able to easily create and edit custom reports so customers can view their data in different formats</li><li>You’ll work closely with our Customer Success team ensuring that everything is in place from a technical implementation perspective for rollouts and trials</li></ul> <br> <p><b> As the ideal candidate, you... </b></p><ul><li>Have experience working with SQL (plus if it is SQL Server)</li><li>Are familiar with the most common structured or delimited file formats (CSV, XML, JSON, etc) </li><li>Are familiar with data transfer methods (SFTP, HTTP, TCP, SOAP, REST, etc)</li><li>Ideally are familiar with ETL Tools and Python</li><li>Are eager to work for a high-growth tech company. It comes with lots of benefits and opportunities, but it’s not for everyone. </li></ul> <br> <p> Apply!  If you think this sounds like something you’d enjoy and excel at, we would love to hear from you!   To apply, please send us your CV and a short paragraph explaining why you think you’d make a great Junior Data Engineer to claire@rotageek.com  We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p> (We’re not looking to work with recruiters for this job posting so please only contact us if you’re a candidate wishing to apply - thank you!)   </p> ",
