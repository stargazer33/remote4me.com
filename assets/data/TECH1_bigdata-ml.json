Are you passionate about the need for continued improvement in patient care and outcomes in our current healthcare industry? Do you enjoy learning new technologies that propel our healthcare capabilities? We are looking for part time nurse consultants to use their clinical knowledge and experience to work as clinical annotation specialists. At Roam we use artificial intelligence to improve human health through data driven analysis.</p><p><strong>About Roam</strong></p><p>The modern healthcare system generates enormous quantities of diverse, disconnected data. These data sets present substantial analytic challenges, but can also illuminate new avenues of inquiry that yield unprecedented improvements in global health. Roam is realizing this potential by combining our proprietary data platform with advanced machine learning, empowering life sciences companies, hospital systems, insurers, and governments to make data-driven decisions that improve patient outcomes and guide innovation.</p><p>Roam Health Knowledge Graph is the foundation of Roam’s data platform and is central to all our applications. This pre-built data ontology brings the world’s vast healthcare information together using a patent-pending graph architecture that structures the data while embracing the uncertainty inherent in health datasets.</p><p>Our clients generate insight from this data platform through an application suite we’ve engineered to facilitate efficient, iterative analysis of patient-level data at scale and with unprecedented depth. Analysis performed within the Roam ecosystem bypasses the inefficient data integration processes currently required to modify or address a new research question. Roam’s technologies have been used to improve drug development, bring new drugs to market, demonstrate value to payers, and compute real world outcomes. These sample use cases, though distinct, all bring Roam closer to achieving our mission: leverage artificial intelligence to bring about sustainable and affordable improvements in patient health.</p><p><strong>About Role</strong></p><p>Clinical text in electronic patient records is a source of rich, detailed information that could be of great use for health service planning and for the study of disease. The free text notes typed by physicians during patient consultations contain valuable information, however these notes are difficult to process by existing natural language analysis tools since they are highly telegraphic (omitting many words), contain many spelling mistakes, are inconsistent in punctuation, and use non-standard word order.</p><p>The clinical annotation specialist plays a key role in creating usable data from the free text narrative. They will read and analyze narrative content from various health related documents, such as electronic health records. They will use their clinical expertise to assess the meaning of this content and accurately annotate the information using annotation software tools. Annotating the free text data allows for integration of this information into computer models, delivering valuable insights to the healthcare industry.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Read and interpret narrative health data.</li><li>Utilize annotation tools to label narrative content</li><li>Communicate with team effectively</li></ul><p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li>Bachelor’s Degree (or higher) in a clinical health field, such as nursing or medicine with active license</li><li>2+ years of clinical experience</li><li>Skilled at reading and interpreting written information related to clinical concepts</li><li>Willing to learn new technologies needed for annotation tasks</li><li>Proficient computer skills related to team communication and word processing tools</li><li><strong>Ability to work remotely and effectively collaborate with a distributed team</strong></li><li>Excellent written, verbal, and interpersonal skills</li></ul><p><strong>Beneficial Experience</strong></p><ul><li>Experience using data annotation tools</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/roam/6d71655a-c8e4-40da-8726-1c35b40d1ff8' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>"

improves the discussion of news articles by allowing users to tag incorrect facts, bad reasoning or uncivil behavior. It is a place where people can comment on news in depth, and share their opinions through social media. </p><p>When multiple people have &quot;fisked&quot; the same article, the system produces a page which highlights the flaws or qualities in the text, as determined by a statistical test of significance of the (human-input) tags. In short, it has the potential to fact-check all online news/content in real time.</p><p>Additionally, by allowing users to fisk each other's comments, we create a granular, peer-reviewed discussion of the topic which is much more useful - and useable -  for interested readers. This allows us to build in a Troll Filter which will enable readers to weed out bad-faith commentary, while preserving Fiskkit's &quot;No Censorship&quot; principle. </p><p>It's the future of online engagement.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Francisco</span>, <span>United States</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>$21K Seed in 2014</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Digital Media</span>, <span>News</span>, <span>Blogging Platforms</span>, <span>Writers</span></div><div><div></div><a href='http://twitter.com/fiskkit' rel='nofollow'>@fiskkit</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://fiskkit.com' rel='nofollow'>fiskkit.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/645/391645-448935d3377d1e925a3c4868e17c8b5d97850972.jpg?1409434617' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/647/391647-1e2834f49606b3cc6be857b62670a3939201a96a.jpg?1409434718' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/653/391653-4abd9dfabc6ac13a568b82e72b51dd09de011e30.png?1409439518' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/654/391654-3db0f14b8aa81d645cbb9119181aa85131aa4726.png?1409439529' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/658/391658-79c6f923d2c1e0cbb66632c67a0449fed8efaa64.jpg?1409441817' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/386434-fiskkit?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;Fiskkit&quot;

that stops malware and reduces the risk of vulnerabilities starting with the 2 billion devices powered by Android.</p><p>Unlike our competitors, BiTSentry is 100% effective at mitigating the risk of malware because we assume everything is a threat up front.  We do not detect or predict anything.  We isolate everything.</p><p>Our technology includes a microkernel, super lightweight virtual machine manager (hypervisor) and encryption management designed to replace the vulnerable and large (14M+ lines of code) linux kernel that Android is built on.  Our microkernel is &lt; 100K lines of code, resulting in a super small attack surface and secure foundation for Android.  This is the first step.  </p><p>Next, we change how executables run on Android so that every application and its data, regardless if its a system app or one you download, runs in its own isolated environment.  </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Diego</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Android</span>, <span>Tablets</span>, <span>Cyber Security</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/secureduniverse' rel='nofollow'>@secureduniverse</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://blog.secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>http://blog.secureduniverse.com</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>secureduniverse.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Secured Universe</h3><ul><li><div>Design Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/73428-ui-ux-jedi' rel='nofollow'>UI/UX Jedi</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69250-aosp-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>AOSP Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69253-virtualization-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Virtualization Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69254-full-stack-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Full Stack Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/73426-kernel-hacker' rel='nofollow'>Kernel Hacker</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Operations Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69045-cfo-co-fundraiser' rel='nofollow'>CFO &amp; Co-Fundraiser</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$120K – $200K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/265393-a-real-hustler-fundraiser-hellraiser' rel='nofollow'>A REAL HUSTLER, FUNDRAISER, HELLRAISER</a><div>San Diego, Silicon Valley·Full Time<span></span><span>·$250K – $300K · 0.0% – 2.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Secured Universe Team</h3><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/steven-rahseparian' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/steven-rahseparian' rel='nofollow'>Steven Rahseparian</a><span>,</span></div><div>34+ Years Software Engineer.

The candidate will use machine learning and statistical techniques in our large datasets to analyze the outputs of our current pipeline and create new treatment prediction models.</p><p>The PanLab is a research group at Stanford University that aims to use brain imaging to improve our understanding and treatment of mental health conditions. Our current projects focus on depression and anxiety, with research that embraces individual differences. We use a variety of tools such as MRI, EEG, behavioral testing, genetics, symptoms, and daily functioning data, in order to match an individual with the best treatment for them, whether that is an antidepressant, psychotherapy, TMS, lifestyle changes, etc.</p><p>We are looking for a candidate with strong data analysis and software engineering experience, but no neuroimaging experience is required! As we are a 30-person team of psychiatrists, neuroscientists, doctors, clinical psychologists, and data scientists, the ability to communicate technical ideas across a range of experiences is vital.

You’ll use your experience to inform our engineering process and decisions when building new features and ensuring scalability and availability of the entire platform.</p><p>You’ll be part of one of our product teams which are multidisciplinary with design, frontend and backend engineering combined. While specialisation is important, we discourage pigeonholing.

This is not theoretical problem. We proved product/market fit with our MVP and are getting paid for our product.

Unfortunately, appointments are spread across many services and we are still wasting a lot of time in back-and-forth emails or phone calls. It's often impossible to share real-time availability with others because Outlook and Google Calendar don't work cross-company.</p><p>FreeBusy is a scheduling assistant powered by A.I. to coordinate meetings 10x faster with contacts inside and outside your company. You can interact with FreeBusy on the web, smartphone, and desktop, using voice, chat, and email.

Our projects are wide ranging, including the discovery of seasonal patterns across many types of mental illness, the discovery of circaseptan (day of the week) patterns in health behaviors, the first replicable evaluation strategy for discrete&nbsp;awareness campaigns, a major overhaul of infectious disease&nbsp;forecasting&nbsp;algorithms, the first evaluation of real-time linkages between macroeconomic conditions&nbsp;and typically unreported mental health issues, and a data driven strategy to passively discover the public's&nbsp;health concerns. Nate&nbsp;Silver's Five Thirty Eight called us &quot;brave scientists&quot; for our broad agenda, and work on controversial issues like&nbsp;gun violence prevention.&nbsp;</p><p>Software engineers are responsible for applying data science techniques to solve problems across our many projects. You’ll have autonomy to work on projects from start to finish, including training machine learning models, to data analysis, to writing scalable production software.</p><p>Good Analytics is a remote company, operating through Slack and Hangouts. You will work with our founders to address customer needs for analytics for a variety of public health problems. We have transformed media monitoring by developing strategies to discover, describe, and deliver actionable trends to numerous organizations. For example, our founders first reported on how Charlie Sheen’s HIV status disclosure impacted public help seeking and testing regarding HIV and HIV risk behaviors. Reporting on this finding led to a second bump in HIV testing eclipsing the impact of traditional awareness days.</p><p>Responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Communicate clearly inside and outside the company, to foster cooperation and development.</li><li>Design and implement major new features for our platform.</li><li>Effectively estimate time to implement designs.</li><li>Write and test code for highly available and high volume workloads.</li></ul><p>Qualifications:</p><ul><li>BS or Master's degree in Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, other related degree, or equivalent experience.</li><li>3+ years experience with software engineering and infrastructure design skills.</li><li>Write well-structured, maintainable, idiomatic code with good documentation.</li><li>Strong work-ethic and passion for problem solving in the real world.</li></ul><p>Preferred Qualifications:</p><ul><li>Experience with Python.

Other analytics tools require you to define events upfront and manually instrument code. Instead, Heap automatically captures everything: clicks, submissions, taps, etc. This lets our users analyze data instantly and retroactively, without writing code.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to Heap</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Heap</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>We're eager to meet all types of engineers, regardless of where you live or what tools you use day-to-day. Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.</p><p>How we work:<br>* Happy Customers &gt; Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be &quot;pure.&quot;<br>* Vision &gt; GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.<br>* Writing &gt; Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.</p><p>We're working on:<br>* Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe).<br>* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.<br>* Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.</p><p>We work in San Francisco but are absolutely open to remote engineers. We'd love to hear from you!</p><p>Interested?

At Simon Data we take that literally. We take pride in what we do every day and how we do it. Providing great software to our customers is rewarding and energizing. We've found a rapidly expanding sweet spot in marketing software and are diversifying our engineering team to keep up with the demand. </p><p>New engineers are welcomed into a team of smart and passionate engineers who love data and writing pragmatic code. We believe that you code better when you know how your work connects to the product and our clients. We also believe that you code better when you're surrounded by other engineers who want you to succeed. This attitude is core to our values.</p><p>As a Core &amp; Data Software Engineer, you'll be exposed to the core of our software and the data it keeps. From your first day on the job, you'll have the opportunity to:</p><p>- Interface with data from dozens of clients, each of which have upwards of a terabyte of data (SQL technologies). <br>- Own the build out our data pipe, aggregating data from both structured and unstructured sources (Hadoop, Spark, HDFS, EMR, Redshift). <br>- Scale and optimize our client facing data warehouse that provides real-time interactivity across millions of rows of data (Redshift, Elasticsearch).<br>- Lead development of statistical models and predictive technology to improve our experimentation and segmentation tooling (Machine learning, D3). <br>- Develop critical features to in our python software stack. <br>- Collaborate with an engineering team who is passionate about quality, staying ahead of the curve, and teamwork.</p><p>Our clients rely on us for accurate data and availability. Making mistakes in our business has direct effects on our clients' customers. We take both of these facts very seriously. At odds with this, Simon embraces the startup ethos of keeping lean and focused. We move quickly (continuous deployment) and emphasize experimentation to test hypotheses. To help us keep a high bar of quality, you'll bring a mindset for creativity and fault tolerance to your work every day.</p><p>Simon's engineering team is distributed across four states; we welcome engineers working at our New York City offices as well as remote employees.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

Yet operationalizing all of the data you collect has historically been both labor-intensive and error-prone. Simon changes all of that by eliminating the pain from three of the most friction-laden marketing activities:</p><p>- Unifying disparate data sources<br>- Connecting your data to your marketing channels<br>- Running rigorous tests and tracking results downstream</p><p>Simon does this by sitting between all of your data sources, giving you the ability to create bespoke customer segments using any combination of criteria. Simon then powers smart, automated workflows that connect these segments to all of your marketing channels, all with a built-in suite of testing and reporting tools to help you optimize every aspect of your lifecycle marketing.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>New York City</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>11-50 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>SaaS</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/simon_data' rel='nofollow'>@simon_data</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://blog.simondata.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.simondata.com/</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://www.simondata.com' rel='nofollow'>simondata.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/784/958/784958-c405656717d64e048423d766c9d194c9377d64e8.png?1485814741' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/784/974/784974-a42b7a220db9dc70c656b7f6a4276738c115e54c.png?1485816813' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startup_talent_profile_images/i/4401-923a5cb111eea37173247ccc7c935391-original?buster=1493065104' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div>Our not-so professional photo shoot at our April 2017 offsite in Soho. </div></div></div><div><div><div>The most important things I looked for in my job search were engineering challenges; team passion, collaboration, and expertise; a solid product future; and quality of life.

At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Software* *Engineer*<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />As Software Engineer you’ll be at the forefront of the next stage of the Switchee platform as enter an exciting period of growth. As a start-up this role will involve working in all areas of the platform: frontend, backend, data analytics and more.<br /><br />* Help design and implement scalable cloud-based solutions for the Switchee platform<br />* Creating internal and external API’s for our hardware, web apps and partners<br />* Developing responsive and engaging web applications<br />* Building out the next version of our real-time streaming analytics system<br />* Support the product team with user testing and development feedback<br />* Collaborate with our Firmware team to ensure our hardware and software work seamlessly<br /><br /><br />*Your* *Experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:<br /><br />* Experience working with IoT device<br />* Knowledge of Event sourcing and Domain Driven Design patterns<br />* Devops, infrastructure as code<br />* Containers and/or Serverless<br /><br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We occasionally work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter by clicking the button below."

Of course there’s plenty of flexibility and lots of opportunities to grow, but we also have share options, private health insurance, and unlimited leave (with a minimum of 5.6 weeks per year - just so everyone actually takes time off). Our CEO is (really) devoted to making Rotageek the best place to work, and so while we work really, really hard, we definitely play hard, too.

We’re helping some of the largest UK organisations move from paper and excel based rotas to intelligent and interactive schedules. In doing so, we’re helping employees gain more ownership over their hours - improving their work-life balance - whilst making sure that businesses improve how they run their operations. We use intelligent technology to make sure the right staff are in the right place at the right time, whilst making the process of creating, communicating and modifying a rota as easy as possible.</p><p><b>What we expect from our Data Engineer<br></b></p><ul><li>You’ll be able to communicate with our clients to develop and support imports and exports from Rotageek</li><li>You’ll be able to easily create and edit custom reports so customers can view their data in different formats</li><li>You’ll work closely with our Customer Success team ensuring that everything is in place from a technical implementation perspective for rollouts and trials</li></ul> <br> <p><b> As the ideal candidate, you... </b></p><ul><li>Have experience working with SQL (plus if it is SQL Server)</li><li>Are familiar with the most common structured or delimited file formats (CSV, XML, JSON, etc) </li><li>Are familiar with data transfer methods (SFTP, HTTP, TCP, SOAP, REST, etc)</li><li>Ideally are familiar with ETL Tools and Python</li><li>Are eager to work for a high-growth tech company.

To apply, please send us your CV and a short paragraph explaining why you think you’d make a great Data Engineer to claire@rotageek.com  We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p> (We’re not looking to work with recruiters for this job posting so please only contact us if you’re a candidate wishing to apply - thank you!)   </p> "

    "content": "*SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE*<br /><br />OLIO is the world’s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and our mission is to solve the problem of food waste in the home & local community. We do this by connecting anyone with spare food – which can be households or local businesses – with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away £800 of food each year - collectively adding up to £15bn.

It is the first scientific, highly scalable, ethical participant recruitment platform for researchers around the world. Quantitative and qualitative researchers, data scientists, and entrepreneurs all need valid and reliable data sources to make predictions about human behaviour, social change, and global developments. Thanks to our online platform, researchers collect responses fast and participants earn cash rewards for themselves or for charity. It takes 5 minutes to start data collection, there's no middleman, and the product easily integrates with any survey software. In a world of unreliable results, Prolific makes data trustworthy and connects the public with science.<br /><br />The role<br /><br />In this role you will develop and implement data analyses, data collection systems, and other strategies that help us better understand user behaviour as well as our business and product performance. You will be analysing data using statistical techniques with a focus on understanding our growth engine, users’ full life cycle, data quality, and user demographics (for representative sampling): How does Prolific currently acquire, convert, and retain its users (both Researchers and Participants)? And what can be done to improve user acquisition, conversion, and retention? What are the current demographics of the pool, and what differences are there to the general population? Which participants are the most honest and engaged, and which are not?<br /><br />You will have an opportunity to learn about the startup ecosystem, about the lean startup approach, and about user acquisition techniques and growth strategies. More broadly, you will get the chance to learn about business and product development, data science, and diverse research areas in the social and natural sciences.<br /><br />This is your chance to get involved in a fast-moving startup where you’ll have huge influence over the trajectory of the product. Since it’s a startup, you’ll have the opportunity to suggest how you can best add value, and make any recommendations about improving the processes and product.
