We are trying to find ways to describe groups of people mathematically. Some groups with well defined structures are easy, such as a company, government or an army. Others are hard: such as a village, academia or an online community interested in bitcoin. We are interested in the latter.</p>  <p>We believe this project can open the doors to solving the fundamental problems in decentralized systems design.</p>  <p><strong>These will be your tasks</strong></p>  <p>As a backend developer you’ll be responsible for managing things like scheduling background tasks, building API routes for our clients, and collecting and storing data from other APIs for use in our algorithms, all the while logging and fixing errors along the way. If you like working with MVC’s transforming and moving data in creative and efficient ways, this if for you.</p>  <p>We are also constantly finding new scaling challenges as we collect more data and users and need to readjust deployment on our servers. We need to manage communication between services, backups, testing, as well as resource management such as memory.</p>  <p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Intermediate Python</li>   <li>A history of using MVC’s like Django or Rails</li>   <li>Basic MySQL</li>   <li>Docker</li>   <li>Be the type of person who is language independent and enjoys using new tech</li>   <li>Git</li>   <li>Basic crontab</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Bonus</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>AWS</li>   <li>NGINX</li>   <li>Kubernetes</li>   <li>Github and its services</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>We’re offering these benefits</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Work on hard &amp; fundamental problems</li>   <li>Equity options</li>   <li>Work from home or office or a cafe (whatever you prefer!)</li>   <li>Work visa sponsorship to Germany (if you wish to relocate)</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>How we work</strong></p>  <p>We are mostly a distributed team of 5 and growing. Most of the team members are located in Europe.</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Choose your location:</strong> It would be ideal for you to work with the team in Berlin and we are happy to sponsor a German Work Visa for you. If it is not possible for you to work from Berlin we can also offer that you work remotely.</li>   <li><strong>Regular off-sites:</strong> At least every quarter we make a point for the team to meet in person and work together for a couple of days. We typically rent a big house where we live and work for several days.</li>   <li><strong>Communication:</strong> We use the following tools at work: Slack for instant messaging Asana for task management Standup Alice (Slack bot) for weekly stand-ups 1:1 calls on per need basis</li>   <li><strong>Working time:</strong> We currently do not track your hours worked (eg. Mon-Fri 9-5) however we do expect you deliver results on tasks. We do expect that you will be available on Slack in the afternoon, Central European Time (GMT+1).</li>   <li><strong>Office:</strong> Most of us currently work remotely from home, cafés etc. and you are welcome to do the same. If you work with us in Berlin you can join us in our coworking space to get more of an “office culture”.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Culture of Critical Thinking</strong></p>  <p>One of the biggest risks we face is that we can fool ourselves into believing that we got something to work when we in fact did not. This is because verifying accuracy of our algorithm’s outputs takes a long time and significant infrastructure. This means that an experiment that was not well-thought through enough can lead us to wasting months of work. We cannot afford that. For this reason, it is essential that we build a culture around critical thinking and closely follow the scientific method.</p>  <p>If you are not familiar with Critical Thinking &amp; the Scientific Method, we encourage you to watch the following videos before having a chat with us:</p>  <p>Critical Thinking Course</p>  <p>Richard Feynman discussing the Scientific Method</p>  <p><strong>Big no-no’s</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Calls to authority (“I’ve been doing this for 20 years and you’re just an intern, we’ll do it my way”; “world’s top experts agree that…”)</li>   <li>Discrediting ideas based on their public perception (“If you think that you are a X, Y, Z”)</li>  </ul>  <p>Please include your GitHub account or some kind of portfolio of works within your CV/resume.</p> </div><a href='https://hive.join.com/jobs/292604-backend-developer?pid=98c1261599ca17c51388&amp;utm_source=berlinstartupjobs&amp;utm_medium=paid&amp;utm_campaign=singlepostingstandard&amp;utm_content=backenddeveloper' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this position</a>",

We’ll work to shield you from all other responsibilities and meetings so that you can maximally focus on solving a variety of interesting technical and business challenges.</p><p>We’re planning to double in size for each of the next two years. Fast-growing companies are often constrained by their ability to find or cultivate internal leaders (both purely technical leaders and people leaders). Accordingly, you’ll have significant autonomy in determining your projects, their requirements, and their architectures.</p><p>We’re exceptionally remote-friendly: about half of our team is remote, our San Francisco office has “portals” (a large TV, high quality microphone, and webcam) in every well-trafficked room, and remote team members even participate in lunch conversations, our book clubs, and our AI research club.</p><p><strong>About Sourceress</strong></p><p>Our mission is to help people find work that matters. We believe that the world is better when people understand the opportunities available to them. Our human-assisted AI platform delivers great results to our customers (customer quote: “I’d have a panic attack if you guys stopped existing”).</p><p>Because of this, we raised $3.5M from OpenAI researchers and Lightspeed Venture Partners at one of the highest ever valuations coming out of YC. Our team has previously sold companies, published machine learning research, has Dropbox’s former Chief of Staff, and hails from MIT, Google, Airbnb, McKinsey, etc.</p><p>Help us create a world where all 7 billion people work at jobs that they love, do things that they’re great at, and work for companies that are solving meaningful problems.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Solve the most important problems facing the business (generally by writing software, but not always!)</li><li>Minimize the complexity of the software that we create and maintain.</li><li>Continually improve your own software engineering skills (whether via side projects, classes, or whatever else works for you)</li><li>Help develop our team of talented engineers by mentoring, collaborating on projects and providing detailed code / architecture reviews.</li></ul><p><strong>Sample projects</strong></p><ul><li>For detail-oriented engineers that love to build beautiful and highly correct products: we have greenfield customer-facing product work. These users depend on and love Sourceress, and are eager to help improve the product and provide feedback to your work.</li><li>For engineers that love rapid prototyping and hate CSS: we have a variety of products for our highly-trained internal contracting team. These are critical to the magical feeling of our product and often require creative solutions and complex interfaces.</li><li>For engineers who love data, systems, and infrastructure: we’re also building a distributed model training and model scoring system. Because we care about all of the candidates in the world, we run into quite interesting infrastructure scaling problems that most startups would not hit they were much larger. As a result, a relatively small number of engineers get to solve “large” infrastructure problems end-to-end.</li><li>For engineers interested in machine learning, we have a variety of interesting problems touching a huge variety of sub-fields: NLP, deep learning, interpretability, fairness, graph-based learning, entity resolution, and much more are all relevant to our work. Engineers without prior experience but interest in learning can and will be taught the relevant skills.</li><li>For those engineers who care about clean code, developer tooling and productivity: we pride ourselves on exceptional developer tooling, and are constantly investing in our internal tools. For example: we’ve created a method that that allows us to attach a debugger to any process that has encountered an unexpected exception, <em>even in production</em>. This tool (we call it the Platinum Debugger) eliminates the time-consuming and often difficult step of reproducing the bug for about 90% of our bugs, vastly improving our productivity.</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>3+ years of software engineering experience.</li><li>You’re an effective executor. You understand both the value of shipping quickly and of software craftsmanship, and have the judgment to know when to apply each. You’re capable, focused, and productive.</li><li>You’re cognizant of the multi-year consequences of your decisions.</li><li>You’r dependable. You do high-quality work, on time.</li><li>You’re incredibly smart.</li></ul><p><strong>Stack</strong></p><ul><li>Typescript (react)</li><li>Type-annotated Python 3 (django, scikit-learn, pytorch)</li><li>PostgreSQL</li><li>AWS</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/sourceress/496094d0-1cb6-4b64-b59b-c6fdf0914709' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong><br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p>\n <p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p>\n <p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p>\n <p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p>\n <p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p>\n <p><strong>How to Apply</strong><br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p>\n <p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p>\n <p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p>\n <p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p>\n <p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p>\n <p><strong>How to Apply</strong><br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

By not relying on pattern matching or similar approximations, CodeSonar's static analysis engine is extraordinarily deep, finding 3-5 times more defects on average than other static analysis tools.</p>\n <p>Unlike many software development tools, such as testing tools, compilers, configuration management, etc., SAST tools can be integrated into a team's development process at any time with ease. SAST technologies like CodeSonar simply attach to your existing build environments to add analysis information to your verification process.</p>\n <p>The <strong>Research Team </strong>responds to Request for Proposals from government and other sponsors:</p>\n <p>Our expertise in software analysis and binary transformation comes from decades of experience of high-tech research with the U.S. government and other organizations. Over the past two decades, we have partnered with several groups to help solve some of the most complex software challenges that impact devices' resiliency, safety, and security. Our work has been focused in three areas:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Software Assurance:</strong>&nbsp;new techniques and technologies for analyzing and correcting software to ensure runtime integrity and prevent unplanned system breaches and failures.</li>\n  <li><strong>Software Hardening:</strong>&nbsp;technologies solely focused on system resiliency.</li>\n  <li><strong>Autonomic Computing:</strong>&nbsp;providing software systems with the ability to ‘self-protect’</li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Competitive base salaries - whether in Ithaca, Madison or remote!</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flex Time - flexible hours, ample vacation time, available day one</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Floating Holidays - flexible holidays can be taken on any day</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Healthcare -health, dental, &amp; vision; covered day one</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Annual bonuses and raises - above cost of living increases</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Generous pension plan - after 13 months of employment</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>SNACKS - plenty of free snacks!</span> </li> \n</ul>",

We have people from SoFi, Fortress Capital, Credit Suisse and Bank of America.\n<br>\n<br>A TASTE OF WHAT WE DO\n<br>See if you enjoy these questions:\n<br>• If political views in a neighborhood begin to shift, how would it affect demand for mortgages?\n<br>• If you had data on all student loans in the United States, how could you use it to make money?\n<br>• Imagine you have an incredible 99% accurate model predicting defaults on unsecured loans, but it\n<br>is mostly relying on age, race, and gender of the applicant, which would be illegal. Can you still do\n<br>something useful with the model?\n<br>• A model takes 3 days to train, but you must tune it to get improvement in one week to impress\n<br>investors. What would you do?\n<br>• A partner company gave you a proprietary dataset for which we have paid $100k, yet the target\n<br>column has 50% missing values, rendering the whole project unfeasible. How would you\n<br>communicate this situation to your colleagues? What should be the next step?\n<br>• Is the python expression (lambda x: x) in {lambda x: x} true or false?\n<br>OUR GOAL is to become the modern-day “Village Banker”. The traditional Village Banker conducted\n<br>business through relationships and deep knowledge of the end customer’s true financial situation and\n<br>behavioral characteristics. We are doing the same using modern machine learning and data analytics.\n<br>OUR PROPRIETARY risk engine is in production with a top 10 U.S. bank originating over $100 MILLION\n<br>of loans every MONTH!\n<br>\n<br>OUR VALUES\n<br>• COLLABORATIVE – but we respect your autonomy!\n<br>• CURIOUS – new solutions are better than the status quo.\n<br>• RESULTS – we embrace “what works”. Elegant software design is not a priority.\n<br>• AMBIGUITY – we often make decisions based on imperfect information.\n<br>• COMMITTED – once we make a commitment, we see the project to the completion.\n<br>\n<br>POSITION SUMMARY\n<br>The data scientist will develop advanced machine-learning models. Yet it is not about tuning a model from\n<br>98% to 99%; we target problems with no state-of-the-art solution, and no guarantee that a solution exists.\n<br>The business aspect is just as important as the data science one. Expect messy proprietary datasets with\n<br>little or no documentation, arcane compliance requirements, and calculated risk-taking when you only have\n<br>1-2 chances for your model to perform well, or else it risks being discarded.\n<br>\n<br>PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES\n<br>• (Help) develop and optimize new models using multiple data sources of varying quality.\n<br>• (Help) manage and monitor existing models.\n<br>• Assist with infrastructure improvements, if you are interested in this direction.\n<br>• Conduct and interpret experiments, conduct R&amp;D. You can typically choose the direction, and it\n<br>can be as math- and CS-heavy as you want!\n<br>• Participate in business-related discussions and build an understanding of the overall context.\n<br>• Be a proactive and enthusiastic team member, as cheesy as it sounds!\n<br>• You must be open to learning.\n<br>\n<br>REQUIRED SKILLS/EXPERIENCE\n<br>• Solid programming fundamentals.

    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.\n<br>\n<br>We may be only four years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 40 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 300% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.\n<br>\n<br>To strengthen our small team of 21 passionate and ambitious people and to take care of them and our office, we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us. Your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.\n<br>\n<br>As Data Scientist you’ll be at the forefront of the next stage of the Switchee platform as we enter an exciting period of growth.\n<br>\n<br>Help us discover the information hidden in vast amounts of our data to make smarter decisions for our business and to deliver even better products. Your primary focus will be in applying data mining techniques, doing statistical analysis, and building high quality predictive systems integrated with our products at scale.\n<br>\n<br>As a start-up this role will involve working in all areas of the platform, this role offers there are huge opportunities to apply Data Science right across our business. As this is the first hire for a data scientist it provides a unique opportunity to help us build our data platform from the ground up.\n<br>\n<br>Your responsibilities:\n<br>\n<br>- Work with stakeholders throughout the organization to identify opportunities for leveraging company data to drive business solutions.\n<br>- Develop custom data models and algorithms to apply to data sets.\n<br>- Doing ad-hoc analysis and presenting results in a clear manner\n<br>- Coordinate with different functional teams to implement models and monitor outcomes.\n<br>- Support the product team with user testing and development feedback\n<br>- Collaborate with our Firmware team to ensure our hardware and software work seamlessly\n<br>\n<br>Your Experience and skills\n<br>\n<br>- Bachelor's/Master's/PhD or equivalent in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Science, Statistics, Mathematics, Physics or similar quantitative discipline\n<br>- Proficiency in Python (or R) and experience in developing and deploying models to a production system or commercial use\n<br>- Experience using both SQL/NoSQL and Big Data platforms\n<br>- Experienced with cloud infrastructure (GCP, AWS, Azure)\n<br>- Independent with good communication and team working skills\n<br>- Strong problem-solving skills with an emphasis on product development.\n<br>\n<br>Nice to have:\n<br>\n<br>- Experience working with IOT device:\n<br>- Knowledge of Time series forecasting models\n<br>- AWS Sagemaker\n<br>\n<br>What we look for in you:\n<br>\n<br>We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:\n<br>\n<br>- You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.\n<br>- You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market.\n<br>- You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems.\n<br>- You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.\n<br>- You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.\n<br>- You’re open, positive &amp; straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.\n<br>- You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.\n<br>\n<br>More about our mission\n<br>\n<br>We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.\n<br>\n<br>This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.\n<br>\n<br>We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.\n<br>\n<br>Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.\n<br>\n<br>Life at Switchee\n<br>\n<br>We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. Currently, we have an informal policy where we each decide how much holiday we want to take with no formal limit. We occasionally work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.\n<br>\n<br>We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.\n<br>\n<br>If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.\n<br>\n<br>If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter. \n<br>\n<br>Please note: Successful candidates should be able to attend a face-to-face interview at our office in London.\n<br>\n<br>Switchee is an equal opportunity employer. All applicants will be considered for employment without attention to race, colour, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, veteran or disability status. If you’re smart and good at what you do, come as you are.",

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p>\n <p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p>\n <p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p>\n <p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p>\n <p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p>\n <p><strong>How to Apply</strong><br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

    "content": "About us\n<br>\n<br>Disperse is a VC-backed artificial intelligence construction startup focused on improving on-site productivity with the help of computer vision. Our goal is to ultimately re-imagine the way building projects are planned, delivered and operated.\n<br>\n<br>We're currently working on some of the largest building projects in London (e.g. Renzo Piano’s Shard Place, Wood Wharf) and have grown from 5 to 35 people over the past year. We have ambitions to expand significantly, which means that we are looking for passionate and enthusiastic talent to join the team.\n<br>\n<br>We move at a high speed, and will provide you with immense opportunities for initiative, creativity and leadership. Our proudly diverse, international team is based in London, Sarajevo and Yerevan, and has a wealth of experience from construction management to computer vision and robotics.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Your role\n<br>\n<br>We are looking for a highly motivated and passionate Computer Vision Engineering Intern to join our growing team. Someone who is excited at the prospect of applying deep knowledge and expertise to shape the future of the construction industry and to have a direct impact on productivity.\n<br>\n<br>As part of your role, you will collaborate with our senior Computer Vision researchers and the wider Engineering team to both use and craft state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to creatively solve real-world problems in the construction sector. Interns form a core part of our team, so you will be given lots of responsibility from day one, driving your own project which would involve creating interactive prototypes and seeing your algorithms go live in production.\n<br>\n<br>If you're eager to learn and take on responsibility, this role is a superb opportunity to grow and build your skills in a world-class team. You will also receive regular mentoring from different members of the team to make your experience at Disperse the best it can be.\n<br>\n<br>This is an opportunity to join in at the start of something new, and if you prove to be a great fit after the internship period, we'll happily convert you to an equitable full-time position.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Our culture\n<br>\n<br>Ask anyone at Disperse what they love most about working here, and they'll probably tell you &quot;it's the people!&quot;, &quot;the team, of course&quot;, &quot;the people and the Hedwig owls in the offices&quot;.\n<br>\n<br>As cliched as it may sound, we're very proud of the people we have and the close-knit, family culture we've built across London, Sarajevo and Yerevan. Despite the distances, we're united through the passion with which we approach our goals and the fun that we have along the way. We always look out for each other, no matter what. The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:\n<br>\n<br>We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.\n<br>\n<br>We support each other. If a process breaks or if you're struggling, you can always count on the people around you and the people far away from you, to help you get back on track.\n<br>\n<br>We run on feedback: direct and transparent praise and constructive criticism, communicated with the best of intentions. There is no other way to learn!\n<br>\n<br>Ideas and approaches are always judged on merit rather than source. We welcome discussions and challenges. This way everyone makes a tremendous impact no matter the role.\n<br>\n<br>REQUIREMENTS\n<br>\n<br>You should apply if:\n<br>\n<br>You have a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, Engineering or a related technical field.\n<br>You have a strong knowledge of and experience with Computer Vision and Machine Learning, especially neural networks.\n<br>You have strong communication skills - you can summarise the complex, liaise with your fellow Computer Vision engineers, and explain your work in simple terms to your other colleagues.\n<br>You're a problem solver and analytical thinker; you don't accept the status quo and are always looking for creative solutions.\n<br>You have proven experience in translating project requirements to prototypes and robust software.\n<br>\n<br>Technical requirements\n<br>\n<br>You have excellent programming and debugging experience in Python.\n<br>You are a master at manipulating large data sets of videos and images.\n<br>You have practical experience in one or more neural network frameworks (e.g. Tensorflow, Pytorch).\n<br>You have experience of working with Unix systems.\n<br>\n<br>BENEFITS\n<br>\n<br>Pro rata salary of 30,000 per annum for internship period, then 40,000 - 50,000 per annum plus generous option package after transition to a full-time role after 4-months.\n<br>Bi-weekly academic reading groups to stay at the cutting edge of the field.\n<br>Friendly, open and transparent culture.\n<br>You'll get to join a passionate startup with proven traction on its scaling journey.\n<br>Flexible working hours / ability to work from home.\n<br>Regular mentoring and feedback.\n<br>Awesome start-up office in Central London, Fitzrovia\n<br>25 days' holiday plus all bank holidays.\n<br>Free coffee.\n<br>Regular socials and team retreats to exotic destinations (Tibilisi, Sarajevo,...Where next?)\n<br>\n<br>The process\n<br>\n<br>The interview process will involve:\n<br>\n<br>A review of your application;\n<br>A 20-minute chat where we both can learn more about each other;\n<br>Homework assignment for us to get a sense of how you tackle problems;\n<br>Two rounds of on-site technical and cultural chats with the team. If you are not currently based in London, we would be happy to speak with you over video chat;\n<br>Final round to iron out any remaining questions you may have.\n<br>This process should take around two weeks, depending on diaries.",

    "content": "WHO IS BEELINE?\n<br>\n<br>Beeline is on a mission to help the world have better journeys on two wheels through great navigation software and hardware. Founded in 2015 by Mark and Tom, two friends who wanted to solve getting lost in London on their bikes, Beeline has now grown into a healthy young business with big ambitions to grow (currently in discussions with VC backers to accelerate this further)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Beeline’s first product, the Velo, is a beautifully designed device that sits on the bike handlebar and gives navigation guidance to the rider. It was launched on Kickstarter in 2015, and has since sold over 10,000 units. The Moto (the edition for motorcycles) is launching this month and has already taken over 9,000 pre-orders. The first deal to integrate into shared bikes and scooters, or micromobility, has recently been confirmed, with several others in the pipeline – the number of Beeline users will at least triple in the next 9 months. In parallel, we’re building machine learning mapping and routing algorithms dedicated to bikes and scooters, with backing from the European Space Agency. \n<br>\n<br>Micromobility is set to be part of the transport solution for our ever more crowded cities. So it’s not only the hottest topic in tech right now but done right, has the potential to have a real impact for good by decongesting and depolluting our cities. \n<br>\n<br>We firmly believe that great navigation will be a key enabler to that growth and are very excited to have closed our first deal (the first in the industry). However, we want to be THE navigation provider to this whole industry, not just to one player, and we need someone to lead the charge on that ambition. \n<br>\n<br>WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:\n<br>\n<br>We’re looking for someone to work directly with the founders of the business to drive our growth into micrombility. The role will be a blend of strategy and sales - becoming an expert in this fast growing industry and building strong relationships with decision makers inside some of the fastest growing tech companies right now as well as the city officials who are trying to keep up with them. You’ll also help shape our product strategy by bringing your thinking to how we offer value to these operators beyond just navigation and cement our position as an invaluable layer in the industry. \n<br>\n<br>You’ll have a year or two of commercial experience under your belt and be comfortable with market analysis. More important than your experience will be your ability to think analytically, look at the big strategic picture and most importantly, be fascinated by how the shifts in urban transport could change the shape of cities in the future!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>IMPACT OF THE WORK:\n<br>Two wheeled transport is set to play a huge role in the future of our cities as well as a leisure activity, and we think our products will be a key enabler to this growth. Bike use is growing for good reasons – the combined impact of improving citizens’ health and wellbeing as well as the broader environmental benefits make this a no brainer. \n<br>\n<br>The trend in micromobility is a huge driver in this change (as well as two wheeled delivery fleets like Deliveroo and Uber Eats and the growth of e-bikes). Providing them with great navigation will both enable them to grow and maximise their positive impact and will likely be the strongest area of growth for our business for the next few years. So you’ll be absolutely pivotal in the success of Beeline as well as making the world a better place. \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>WE CAN OFFER YOU:\n<br>A competitive salary and generous options (shares)\n<br>Hands on startup experience working with the founders in a business-critical role \n<br>A part to play in the future of urban transport\n<br>A relaxed, supportive and jovial team culture - we aim to take our work seriously without taking ourselves too seriously. Socials in the pub or running round the local park are commonplace! \n<br>The opportunity to shape the future of this young, growing company\n<br>\n<br>YOU CAN OFFER US:\n<br>1-3 years commercial experience (likely finance or consulting, but not a must)\n<br>Interest in the future of cities and mobility\n<br>A rounded skillset: \n<br>Research skills\n<br>analytical skills for developing Go-To-Market strategy\n<br>Strong interpersonal skills for developing relations with cities and operators\n<br>Creativity, especially for product strategy\n<br>Comfortable designing and implementing processes - this is a fairly new role in a fast-paced area: adaptability and speed of execution will be crucial",

Qntfy is a small (but growing) company offering a diverse array of products and services.

As such, we do not have a rigid checklist of qualifications, but we do expect successful candidates to be able to demonstrate extensive experience with most of the qualifications below. Similarly, we do not have strict educational requirements for data scientists, but of course advanced degrees in quantitative disciplines (broadly construed) are viewed favorably.
