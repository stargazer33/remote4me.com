If so, Nesta has an exciting opportunity for an exceptional individual to join us to work on front end development in the innovation mapping team within Nesta’s Research Analysis and Policy department.</p><p><strong>About Nesta and Innovation Mapping</strong></p><p>Nesta is an innovation foundation. For us, innovation means turning bold ideas into reality and changing lives for the better.&nbsp; We use our expertise, skills and funding in areas where there are big challenges facing society. Nesta is based in the UK and supported by a financial endowment.&nbsp; We work with partners around the globe to bring bold ideas to life to change the world for good.</p><p>Based within the Research Analysis and Policy department, Innovation Mapping uses new data sources, data science and machine learning methods and ways of presenting information to inform research and innovation policy.&nbsp; We believe research and innovation policy can be transformed by more sophisticated mapping of innovative activity, and of the people and organisations behind it, ultimately making it smarter, more inclusive and fitter for the future. Currently we are developing new innovation indicators for the EU, mapping health innovation across the world, and measuring innovation in the News and Journalism sector.</p><p><strong>About this exciting opportunity</strong></p><p>You will be involved in front end development for the web apps created by Nesta’s innovation mapping team, working closely with Luca Bonavita, our Data Visualisation Development lead. This involves development and testing of web applications consuming data from REST APIs of various sources (the most important one being our Data Production System), and transforming it to make it available to components, using Svelte and modern Web APIs like HTML, CSS, SVG, Canvas, and others.</p><p><strong>About this key role</strong></p><p>You’re someone who enjoys building accessible and performant websites and you have a good knowledge of web APIs like those mentioned above. You also know Svelte and Sapper, how to write web components and are familiar with rollup/webpack/gulp and proficient with the npm ecosystem. You’re able to evaluate and learn new libraries and APIs and can consume data from a REST API, directly or using GraphQL or other methods. You’re also comfortable with the Mapbox API and other file-based mapping libraries and use functional programming principles to transform data. All you need is the perfect home for your skills to thrive – welcome to Nesta.</p><p><strong>Nesta is committed to equality, diversity and inclusion – we welcome and encourage applications from everyone.</strong></p><p><strong>Closing date: 2 December 2019 at 8am. Interviews: w/c 9 December 2019</strong></p><p>Tagged as: Data, front end developer, innovation, web apps</p></div>",

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\\n\\nWe take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.\\n\\nOur current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic. We don’t expect you to have experience with everything on this list, and we’ll help you learn what you don’t know!\\n\\nAs a front-end engineer at Olo, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us build one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the hospitality industry. You will help us shape the digital guest experience for restaurant brands served by Olo. You will contribute to technology selection, architecture and user experience for our front-end applications.\\n\\nAny engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* Experience building ADA compliant user interfaces that put users first and look and feel awesome to use\\n\\n* Deep knowledge of ES6/ES2015+ and one or more modern Javascript frameworks, with a preference for Ember\\n\\n* In-depth experience with the back-end of the stack (Bonus: .NET)\\n\\n* Experience creating and maintaining automated tests\\n\\n* Leadership experience that spans one or more aspects of technology selection, architecture and design oversight, and mentoring others\\n\\n* Superb problem solving skills with an emphasis on pragmatism, quality, performance, and scalability\\n\\n* Passion for learning new skills and technologies\\n\\n* Excellent collaboration and communication skills\\n\\n* BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience\\n\\n* Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English\\n\\n* Legal right to work in the U.S.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Olo\\n\\nOlo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 300 restaurant brands across 70,000 locations. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded guest interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded websites and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, over 100 million consumers use Olo to order ahead or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s (DIN), Chili’s (EAT), Denny’s (DENN), Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice (JMBA), Noodles &amp; Company (NDLS), Red Robin (RRGB), Shake Shack (SHAK), sweetgreen, Wingstop (WING), and more. SKIP THE LINE®\\n\\nOlo is located on the 82nd floor of One World Trade Center.&nbsp; We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!). Check out our culture map:https://www.olo.com/images/culture.jpg.\\n\\nWe encourage you to apply!&nbsp;\\n\\nAt Olo, we know a diverse and inclusive team not only makes our products better, but our workplace better. Many groups are consistently underrepresented across the tech sector and we are fully committed to doing our part to move the needle.&nbsp;\\n\\nOlo is an equal opportunity employer and diversity is highly valued at our company. All applicants receive consideration for employment. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\\n\\nIf you like what you read, hear, and/or know about Olo, and want to be a part of our team, please do not hesitate to apply! We are excited to hear from you!  </div> </div>",

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\\n\\nWe take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.\\n\\nOlo is revolutionizing the customer experience with restaurant chains, and we're looking for talented engineers to join our team and help achieve this vision. As part of the team you will play a significant and visible role in helping us scale one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the market. You will design, develop, scale, and monitor solutions, improvements, and services in our core ordering platform. While primarily focused on our back-end, the position requires contributions throughout our stack.\\n\\nYou'll work with a smart, passionate team dedicated to delivering amazing products using modern tools and technologies such as .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, TeamCity, GitHub, Octopus Deploy, and heavy use of OSS.\\n\\nAny engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team (and Olo) is remote!\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* A passion for computing that extends beyond work\\n\\n* At least 3 years on-the-job development experience\\n\\n* A drive to automate anything that has to be done more than once\\n\\n* Proficient knowledge of C#, .NET and object oriented concepts\\n\\n* Experience writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)\\n\\n* Strong understanding of Windows, SQL Server and networking concepts\\n\\n* Experience instrumenting, deploying and monitoring production code&nbsp;\\n\\n* Excellent English writing and communication skills\\n\\n* Legal right to work in the U.S.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeneficial\\n\\n\\n* B.S degree or equivalent education\\n\\n* Experience developing for highly available and horizontally scalable platforms\\n\\n* Experience with any of: Kafka, Redis, distributed messaging systems, Amazon Web Services, F#\\n\\n* A background in restaurant or e-commerce technology, including point of sale systems, payment gateways, and CRM and loyalty platforms\\n\\n* Working knowledge of ASP.NET, JavaScript, HTML5/CSS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Olo\\n\\nOlo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 300 restaurant brands across 70,000 locations. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded guest interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded websites and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, over 100 million consumers use Olo to order ahead or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s (DIN), Chili’s (EAT), Denny’s (DENN), Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice (JMBA), Noodles &amp; Company (NDLS), Red Robin (RRGB), Shake Shack (SHAK), sweetgreen, Wingstop (WING), and more. SKIP THE LINE®\\n\\nOlo is located on the 82nd floor of One World Trade Center.&nbsp; We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!). Check out our culture map:https://www.olo.com/images/culture.jpg.\\n\\nWe encourage you to apply!&nbsp;\\n\\nAt Olo, we know a diverse and inclusive team not only makes our products better, but our workplace better. Many groups are consistently underrepresented across the tech sector and we are fully committed to doing our part to move the needle.&nbsp;\\n\\nOlo is an equal opportunity employer and diversity is highly valued at our company. All applicants receive consideration for employment. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\\n\\nIf you like what you read, hear, and/or know about Olo, and want to be a part of our team, please do not hesitate to apply!

We use them to produce car valuations, provide vehicle history checks and help dealers and insurance companies to thrive. It's an exciting time to join the business, we're growing fast on the back of epic success and we're well funded by some of London's leading VCs. It seems like every day that another massive company is signing up to use our B2B offerings (and they're house hold names, too). We are the “cool guys” shaking up an archaic industry with big data and machine learning. We have an old B2C site (cazana.com) but our ‘real’ business takes place behind closed doors (B2B) on trade.cazana.com and is only open to paying business customers.</p><p>F# experience is not necessarily required, but you should have a senior level of ability in another functional language.</p><p>Main Responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Development of Data Platform (performant processing, enrichment, cleaning, etc)</li><li>Work on internal services like F# APIs, or lambda functions (sometimes in Python)</li><li>&quot;Parenting&quot; the internal projects: improving system observability, monitoring, automatizing repeatable tasks and optimizing existing solution.</li><li>Be a senior figure to less experienced team mates, answer questions and make good suggestions.</li><li>Refactoring, fixing bugs and performing code reviews.</li><li>Be able to own a task end-to-end on your own, from figuring out what is really needed all the way up to deployment – while engaging teammates for advice and to bounce ideas off along the way.</li><li>Support the data scientists by making sure the data is in the shape they need it to be to deliver.</li></ul><p>We are a Big Data company first and foremost and an interest or experience in dealing with huge data sets is welcome.</p><p>Ideal candidate should:</p><ul><li>Be responsible and work proactively.</li><li>Be persistent and care about high quality of his/her work: this includes various testing approaches (i.e. unit, integration or property-based tests), peer reviews and performance optimizations (mostly on .NET Core platform).</li><li>Be able to share his/her knowledge and experience with other team members.</li><li>Have experience with web crawling, and the nature of scraped data.</li><li>Have a good knowledge of functional programming (a lot of our current work is done in F#).</li><li>Understand event-driven architectures, streaming and actor model programming (part of the system is written in Akka.NET streams).</li><li>Be familiar with AWS platform.</li><li>Know how to automatize deployment process (defining build tasks, Infrastructure as a Code).</li><li>Know how to build efficient, multi-threaded and distributed systems.</li><li>Have general knowledge of SQL and NoSQL. Know when to use which one, based on the business needs. Experience with PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch is always welcome.</li></ul><p>What can we offer:</p><ul><li>100% remote work: the development team embraces fully remote working practices, as we are distributed across the world. Not to say it is mandatory to be remote – we have offices in London and Bucharest. If you live in either the UK or Romania, you could consider to come to one of the offices a few days a week as suits you, or full time if it that’s what makes you happy.</li><li>Flat organization structure: this is not a PLC, we do not have architecture boards etc. We organize and prioritize our tasks by ourselves, according to business needs while balancing technical priorities. We choose technologies and solutions as a group. We trust our staff to do the job well without micromanaging them.</li><li>OSS friendliness: we use a lot of open source stuff here, and we contribute developer time to improve or fix OSS projects which help us with our goals.</li><li>Chance to work in polyglot environment: we have people working in F#, R, JavaScript, PHP and Python.</li><li>If you're a remote worker, we'll fly you into London as often as you like to spend time with us (we have beer, cake, and a very small car called Bamby in our office).</li><li>Minimal meetings. Aside from a brief ~15 minute breakfast meeting on a Monday to quickly fly over what’s on the agenda across the whole business for the week, there is a distinct lack of ‘formal’ meetings in place. We communicate mostly over slack, have adhoc video calls as needed, and work pretty flexible hours.</li></ul>        </div>        <h4>To Apply</h4>        <p>Send email with your CV to <span><span>apply-9190</span> [at] <span>functionaljobs [dot] com</span></span></p>    </div>",

Day to day, you'll be collaboratively solving problems, architecting solutions, and&nbsp;expanding your&nbsp;mastery of CMS web development. If you are a tenacious problem-solver who thrives when digging&nbsp;deep into&nbsp;code and complex data sets, you will fit right in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nWe specialize in the design and development of&nbsp;enterprise&nbsp;.NET&nbsp;websites, so experience&nbsp;working with a.NET content management system (Ektron,&nbsp;Episerver, Umbraco, Sitecore, etc.) is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nSTRATEGY, DESIGN, AND&nbsp;DEVELOPMENT AS A TEAM SPORT.\\n\\nWhen you become a Senior .NET developer at&nbsp;Diagram, you'll get assigned to an account team with a strategist at the helm. Each team is responsible for working with a small group of clients, understanding their business goals, and building out a strategic roadmap to help push them forward.&nbsp;In your role, you&nbsp;can expect&nbsp;a healthy mix of&nbsp;writing code, gathering requirements, participating in design critiques, architecting solutions,and coordinating with your team and clients. Each account team operates autonomously,&nbsp;meaning that&nbsp;the strategies your team propose will drive the&nbsp;work you do—what you can accomplish is limited only by your collective&nbsp;ideas and&nbsp;abilities.&nbsp;\\n\\nLET’S GET TECHNICAL\\n\\nThe incredibly complex nature of the&nbsp;web&nbsp;projects we take on demand a wide range of technical prowess from&nbsp;our development leads. As a DiagramSenior Developer, you'll need to&nbsp;demonstrate expertise in the following areas:\\n\\n\\n* Programming Languages: C#\\n\\n* Microsoft Web Frameworks: ASP.NET, MVC, Razor, Web API\\n\\n* Database Solutions: SQL or TSQL\\n\\n* Strong understanding of&nbsp;core development concepts:&nbsp;Object-Oriented Programming (OOP),&nbsp;relational database concepts, Inversion of Control (IoC), and Dependency Injection (DI)\\n\\n* Integrating third-party solutions through Web Services or other messaging frameworks\\n\\n* Basic knowledge of IIS and setting up local sites\\n\\n* Using Git and version control\\n\\n* Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and other JavaScript frameworks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA&nbsp;HOME&nbsp;FOR DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS\\n\\nOur&nbsp;organizational&nbsp;model involves building out small collaborative teams that kick ass. If you work best when you're handed a blueprint and left alone to build in solitude for weeks on end, you might not be a good fit.&nbsp;Diagram&nbsp;developers prefer to be in the mix of things and would rather contribute to solving real problems with code than to just take orders. You are naturally curious, eager to learn,&nbsp;and play nice with others. As a developer at&nbsp;Diagram, you are treated as a professional, working with other professionals for common goals.Day to day,&nbsp;some of your responsibilities&nbsp;will include:\\n\\n\\n* Work with modern hosting&nbsp;technologies:&nbsp;Azure DevOps,&nbsp;CI/CD, AWS,&nbsp;Episerver&nbsp;DXC, Umbraco Cloud\\n\\n* Analyze, troubleshoot, and resolve&nbsp;issues&nbsp;on enterprise client websites\\n\\n* Adapt to and learn new&nbsp;and emerging .NET/CMS&nbsp;technologies\\n\\n* Communicate and convey technical concepts to clients, team members, and project managers\\n\\n* Contribute to functional requirements and technical documentation\\n\\n* Work both independently as well as collaboratively within a team\\n\\n* Propose and architect&nbsp;technical&nbsp;solutions that&nbsp;help&nbsp;drive our clients forward\\n\\n* Estimate effort for development tasks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWORKING AT DIAGRAM\\n\\nDiagram is a digital&nbsp;consultancy focused on design, development and marketing.

Coordinate within your team, keep up with your work, take time off when you need it. We don't restrict or limit the amount of time off team members take. 'Nuff&nbsp;said.\\n\\nCHALLENGING WORK\\n\\nWe thrive when data is messy, problems are complex, and innovation is needed. We strive to push boundaries and continually ship value for a limited number of retainer clients. We're not a one and done shop.

It's a small team so this isn't suited to anyone who wants to be anonymous. On the other side of this you'll be close to decision making and you will be in an environment where careers grow quickly.</p> <p>The tech is C#, WebAPI, .Net CORE, Service Fabric, Kubernetes, containerisation, Cosmos and loads of Azure - service fabris, message queuing. Also LLBLGen (an ORM), Autofoc for IoC and design patterns, as well as Aurelia and TypeScript.</p> <p>There's a big focus on clean, good quality code so if that's you, apply now!</p> <p>If this company is of interest apply now or get in touch with Travis Kennard.</p></div>",

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\\n\\nThe Developer Support engineering team at Olo supports our partners in their efforts to integrate with our platform. Whether it be an agency building bespoke web and mobile ordering apps for our restaurant brands, a restaurant marketplace integrating to our platform to gain access to Olo customer restaurants, restaurant technology partners building POS or loyalty platform integrations, or a third party ordering platform provider who is building a delivery capability via Olo’s Dispatch delivery brokerage service, third party developers are key components of Olo’s success.\\n\\nThe Olo Developer Support team consults with third party developers to educate them on our APIs, investigates problems reported by partners during their integration and certification, provides timely responses to questions during an integration project, facilitates access to test environments as well as our production environment, develops ongoing improvements to the Developer Portal web application that is used by partners to gain access to API documentation and manage API keys, and provides API documentation updates as needed.\\n\\nAs Engineering Manager, you will lead a team of talented developer support engineers in their efforts to deliver an exceptional integration experience to our technology partners.&nbsp; At Olo we value outcomes over output, and seek a leader who can help us understand the broader needs of our partners and deliver the support, tooling, and documentation necessary to meet those needs.

Our companies are taking mandated professional education to the next level as we produce tools, courses, and job aides that help customers achieve more in their days and their careers.  We help professionals become licensed, stay licensed and gain the skills to perform at the top of their fields.</p><p>Essential Skillset: TypeScript, Angular 6+, Unit Testing (Jasmine/Karma), Experience consuming APIs. GitNice to have: Knowledge of relational databases and SQL .NET / C#</p><p>What You’ll Do: As a Software Engineer, you’ll play a key role in building and testing new features and frameworks for supporting an ecosystem of common web applications used by many subsidiaries within the Colibri Group family of companies. You’ll work as a member of the technology team to collaborate with UX, product management, QA and other software engineers to define new features, estimate and implement them. Your main duties will start within the TypeScript/Angular framework, which will be consuming a .NET API, which you will have the opportunity to work on as well. In addition to creating tests with Jasmine/Karma and completing peer reviewed pull request into our production environment.</p><p>Responsibilities: We practice continuous delivery and work in an agile environment. You'll design and implement critical elements of architecture and application components for common offerings. The ideal applicant pays close attention to detail, is inquisitive, able to be self-directed while open to collaboration. We follow an unapologetic “no ego” release process where fellow engineers input opinions and suggestions on the code you would like to release to production, thereby attempting to ensure the highest quality code is released. You’ll be working on a team that owns the code from development through release into production, for multiple applications, deploying a DevOps model of complete ownership.</p><p>A bit more about the position: The position will involve support of several of our web applications. Foremost among these would be the customer dashboard. Our dashboard is setup to serve our different subsidiary companies with the same set of code. It is angular, with a dash of ionic (which we have been slowly moving away from while staying committed to angular.) The dashboard is actively developed with 11,000 commits over the last two years. As a developer on the membership/mobile team we are concentrating on improving our customers membership experience by adding and improving features to the dashboard. Other applications you will have the opportunity to interact with are a c#.net api application, a .net student course runner application as well as older .net internal applications.</p><p>We run in an agile pattern with two week sprints, story point estimating, daily zoom standups, and sprint retrospectives. Our sprint planning meetings typical have developers discussing what the highest priority is with direction from the product owner and divvying up the sprint work as the developers see fit. The position is 100% remote, with the occasional in person all engineering meetings which occur for a few days every year or two. We have typically had new developers on the team spend a sprint working on improving test coverage as it allows them to get into the code and understand the code base.</p><p>Interested in this job?

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\\n\\nThe Software Infrastructure engineering team at Olo is responsible for the cross-cutting software services and frameworks that enable our product engineering teams to iterate on ideas quickly and deliver reliable services at scale. With Olo’s rise as a key player in restaurant e-commerce (you likely have used our services, even if you didn’t realize it!), we are exploring new architectural paradigms and approaches to enable our future growth. Olo has built a reputation for reliability, and our Software Infrastructure team serves a key role in delivering that exceptional reliability at an ever-increasing scale.\\n\\nAs Engineering Manager, you will lead a team of talented engineers in the day-to-day development of new platform services and frameworks. At Olo, we value outcomes over output, and seek a leader who can help us understand the broader needs of our product engineering teams and deliver solutions to meet those needs. You will help develop and align the team’s vision, guide their execution, remove impediments to the team’s progress, and coach them to develop and grow both their skills and impact. You will foster a culture of collaboration, communication, accountability, skill sharing, belonging, mutual respect, and curiosity.\\n\\nWe expect our Engineering Managers to be seasoned engineers with the technical experience to both guide and challenge their teams to build robust, high-performing solutions. As a servant leader, your focus will be on facilitating strong team outcomes, hiring and developing engineering talent, and ensuring that our systems are ready to support emerging business priorities. While your primary focus will not be one of designing and developing software, we expect our engineering managers to have a strong software development foundation to be able to effectively guide their teams. As such we expect you to have demonstrable experience in software development that spans architecture and design, coding, quality best practices, and production operational concerns.\\n\\nOur technology stack is rooted in .NET and SQL Server running in an AWS infrastructure, and we leverage modern software engineering tools such as GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Datadog, and Sumo Logic, as well as heavy use of OSS.\\n\\nThis is a full-time position. Candidates may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District, or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than 75% of our engineering team is remote!\\n\\nDesired Experience\\n\\n\\n* A&nbsp; passion for computing that extends beyond work\\n\\n* At least 8 years of software development experience with a progression to a senior technical level\\n\\n* At least 3 years of engineering management experience under an Agile operational model\\n\\n* Demonstrated ability to build and mentor a high performance team while seeking continuous improvement\\n\\n* Ability to translate business priorities into viable technology solutions, and deliver\\n\\n* Experience in, and good understanding of, large scale, highly performant, distributed systems architecture and principles\\n\\n* Experience developing realistic project plans, managing stakeholder expectations, and tracking team execution\\n\\n* Experience instrumenting, deploying, and monitoring production code to enable timely incident detection and response\\n\\n* Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)\\n\\n* Experience managing distributed teams consisting largely of remote engineers\\n\\n* BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience\\n\\n* Excellent English writing and verbal communication skills\\n\\n* Legal right to work in the U.S.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Olo\\n\\nOlo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 300 restaurant brands across 70,000 locations. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded guest interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded websites and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, over 100 million consumers use Olo to order ahead or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s (DIN), Chili’s (EAT), Denny’s (DENN), Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice (JMBA), Noodles &amp; Company (NDLS), Red Robin (RRGB), Shake Shack (SHAK), sweetgreen, Wingstop (WING), and more. SKIP THE LINE®\\n\\nOlo is located on the 82nd floor of One World Trade Center.&nbsp; We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!). Check out our culture map:https://www.olo.com/images/culture.jpg.\\n\\nWe encourage you to apply!&nbsp;\\n\\nAt Olo, we know a diverse and inclusive team not only makes our products better, but our workplace better. Many groups are consistently underrepresented across the tech sector and we are fully committed to doing our part to move the needle.&nbsp;\\n\\nOlo is an equal opportunity employer and diversity is highly valued at our company. All applicants receive consideration for employment. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\\n\\nIf you like what you read, hear, and/or know about Olo, and want to be a part of our team, please do not hesitate to apply! We are excited to hear from you!  </div> </div>",

We want to democratize capital by making money more accessible for those who need to borrow it and by making investments with strong returns available to those who would like a better financial future.</p><p>We want to help people grow a nest egg even if they think they can’t… and to do it while supporting Main Street, not Wall Street!</p><p>Our first product is a free micro-investment app that helps you save &amp; grow your money – a dollar at a time. It monitors your everyday spending and rounds up each transaction to a whole dollar. It then automatically invests every $10 into a 5% interest earning Worthy Bond, which in turn supports small creditworthy businesses across the U.S., helping to strengthen our local communities.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with offices in sunny Boca Raton, Florida. We avoid the noise of Slack, but we use Twist, Keybase and Confluence to keep in sync. We’re on Gitlab to take advantage of their integrated CI/CD pipeline (we love continuous stuff!) and issue tracker.</p><h4>Who you are</h4><p>You’re an experienced backend web developer who has worked for 5+ years on a few production web apps and APIs at scale. Experience working on financial or accounting applications preferred.</p><p>You use Python on a daily basis for various tasks, from APIs to scheduled tasks and maintenance scripts.</p><p>You can design and implement an API and future-proof it. You have a strong opinion on whether APIs should be versioned in the URI or in a response header, and can defend that opinion. You know how to upgrade an API while keeping it backwards-compatible for older clients.</p><p>You’re aware of which data fits best in a relational database and which in a document-oriented one. You can use a framework-provided ORM, but can also jump in and fine-tune SQL queries when needed. You know enough database management to create and maintain an efficient schema in PostgreSQL, indexes and all.</p><p>You’re experienced enough to avoid most bugs and programming errors, but you use tools such as linters and write unit &amp; integration tests to catch all the others.</p><p>You can secure both internal and public-facing APIs using different methods, including one-time passwords (TOTP) for two-factor authentication. You consider security and privacy when designing any new features or reviewing existing code.</p><p>Most importantly, you can communicate clearly and efficiently in writing, as well as in online video/audio calls. You can handle the async (over)communication requirements of a remote-first environment and can manage your own time and productivity.</p><p>For everyone’s sake, you develop on either OS X or a Linux flavor. We don’t do windows.</p><p>You are eligible to legally work in the U.S. as a full-time employee. Given the role’s responsibilities, this is a hard requirement, even though we will have other positions where we can hire more liberally. Note that this doesn’t require actual presence in the U.S. (expats welcome!).</p><h4>What you’ll do</h4><p>We’ve build a solid, stable serverless API using Zappa on AWS Lambda. Our infrastructure is mostly managed via Terraform and our deployments are one-click, thanks to Gitlab’s CI/CD pipelines. While we rely on third parties for some key features, we’ve never had any downtime caused by anything we wrote.</p><p>Concretely, you’ll help build new business features as we grow our offerings. You will help us trim our backlog and keep technical debt in check. Since we already have robust test coverage, you will help maintain that by writing unit and integration tests for all new features and any bugs fixed.</p><p>You will also perform light devOps duties via Terraform and (rarely) manually, such as Gitlab instance upgrades or bastion security checks and updates. You’ll participate in planning &amp; prioritization meetings to help estimate complexity and think of creative solutions to business and growth problems.</p><p>You are required to have at least basic experience with our existing stack, but more importantly, you need to have the ability and desire to learn and adapt.</p><h4>What you’ll get</h4><ul><li>you can work remote from anywhere in the U.S. or from our office in Boca Raton, FL</li></ul><ul><li>you’ll set your own work schedule, as long as you can deliver and be productive (we prefer two 3-hour focused, uninterrupted work sessions, with morning, lunch and evening communication breaks to stay in sync)</li><li>competitive salary for a remote position</li><li>health insurance &amp; stock options</li><li>more benefits as we continue growing</li></ul><h4>How to apply</h4><p>We don’t do resumes. They only prove who signed your previous paychecks.</p><p>Send us your Git(hub/lab/bucket) profile, places where we can “see” your backend code in production, along with a short email explaining what kinds of problems you solved in the past, and how you did it.</p><p>In essence, please convince us we’re a good fit for each other with any arguments you’d like.</p><p>We’ll contact you by phone or email for a quick chat, then we’ll set up a video call with the CEO and CTO.</p><p>There will be no gimmicky interview quizzes or whiteboard tests. Instead, we’ll ask you to show us some code, either from a previous job or, if NDAs prevent that, we’ll write some together. This is not to test you under pressure, but to filter out the inevitable applicants who are trying to fake it till they make it.</p><p>We’ll ask you to try out something new and talk us through it, whether it’s a new framework, concept (GraphQL instead of REST?) or an AWS service neither of us used before.
