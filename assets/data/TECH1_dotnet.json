Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Do you like the thought of fighting cybercrime at scale, watching fraudsters struggle against your defenses, while protecting over a hundred million user accounts?</p><p>Fraud is an ongoing concern among restaurant brands, and we aim to make fraud defense a competitive advantage in our product offerings. We’re looking for a software engineer to help fight fraud on behalf of our clients. You’ll be responsible for detecting, fighting, and preventing: credit card fraud, account takeover attacks, gift card enumeration attacks, and distributed botnet attacks of various kinds.</p><p><strong>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!</strong></p><p><strong>Responsibilities include:</strong></p><ul><li>Sharpening our credit card fraud prevention service, Shield.</li><li>Enhancing customer frontends to encourage good security practices.</li><li>Improving monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity in our applications.</li><li>Creating automation to respond to fraud reports in an efficient and professional manner.</li><li>Evaluating and integrating with third party service providers.</li><li>Building visualizations and reporting tools for our clients.</li><li>Advising development teams to ensure anti-fraud measures are in place.</li></ul><p>This is a full stack engineer position. Your work will span all layers across multiple projects in a large, distributed system. Our tech stack includes C#, F#, Ember, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, Datadog, SumoLogic, Cloudflare, and a number of AWS services including Redshift, SQS, S3 &amp; Kinesis Firehose. We don’t expect candidates to be familiar with all of these technologies, but in this role you will gain experience with most of them.</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>An ability to put yourself in a fraudster’s shoes and think like they do, so you know what we are up against.</li><li>An ability to work well with others. You will be working in the codebases of many teams. You will need to communicate well and minimize disruption.</li><li>At least 3 years of professional experience as a full stack software engineer.</li><li>Proficient in multiple programming languages, frameworks, databases, and OS’s.</li></ul><p><strong>Beneficial:</strong></p><ul><li>A background in fraud or security.</li><li>Machine Learning expertise.</li><li>Experience working on SaaS products or distributed systems.</li><li>Experience with PII security frameworks such as NIST 800-122.</li><li>Experience with any technologies in our technology stack (.NET, AWS, etc.)</li></ul><p><strong>About Olo</strong></p><p>Olo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 200 restaurant brands. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded user interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded website and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller. We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients’ menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Olo is revolutionizing the customer experience at these restaurant chains, and we're looking for talented engineers to join our team and help achieve this vision.

We're growing steadily and to meet new demands, we’re developing new products that busy city staffers (and our own business) do and will rely on to make their cities better for their citizens. Candidates must have a passion for getting things done and be highly motivated. Candidates must thrive in an entrepreneurial environment and be eager to learn and contribute to the team setting. Ideally, we are seeking a Central-NJ based candidate.</p><p>This position is for a full-time, Software Engineer, who will work semi-autonomously and as a part of a small, but growing, team to design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain web-based, back-office software which runs our business, as well as significant portions of our customers' as well as on-the-street (usually literally) mobile software.</p><p>Our biggest challenges are, by design, behind the scenes, and experienced by our clients (the cities) and our own mobile workforce. We're not so much worried about achieving &quot;web scale&quot; as we are about making people's jobs and lives easier. And if we can add at least dash of whimsy in there, too, all the better!</p><p>PayLock helps cities with those &quot;necessary evil&quot; parts of city governance. We try to make those things less evil, both for the people doing them and the people having them done to them.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Candidates must have: great communication abilities (after all, we're a&nbsp;service company, and you'll inevitably be talking to customers), great problem solving skills, an insatiable curiosity and ability to learn, and an innate commitment to getting things done—or, more precisely, an innate need to not let things go undone. And a sense of humor doesn't hurt, either.</p><p>For starters, you'll need a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Design. Developers on our team also work on and develop database schemas, so you should have experience (and proficiency) with that as well. Since most of what we're doing is web-based, you've gotta know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and knowing how the Internet works work can't hurt you. If you understand that much, you probably know a lot about many other things and are constantly adding to your repertoire. In fact, you might not even be able to stop yourself. That's a characteristic we really, really dig: fast, eager, creative learners.</p><p>The kinds of things you might find yourself working on are:</p><ol><li>Building and/or extending a RESTful web api for an AngularJS web application</li><li>Designing and building business management tools (to help our business and our clients')--things like dashboards, alerts, and other &quot;knowledge radiators&quot;</li><li>Building and/or rebuilding a data movement pipeline (we do lots of data integrations with our clients and other 3rd parties)</li><li>Mobile apps for our in-the-field and on-the-road workforce</li><li>Tools for us, the developers, to make our own lives easier</li></ol><p>It's also important that you can keep two visions alive: the near-term and the long-term. We find ourselves juggling the needs of the business (often the near-term voice) and the needs of ourselves and the systems and applications we own on the business' behalf. You have to be strong enough to deliver on the near-term objectives while putting in that extra 10% to 20% of effort to accomplish our long-term (i.e. 3-year) objectives. You have to be ok with taking the hard road sometimes, and trust that it'll be worth it (we think it is).</p><p>Repeat after me: Refactoring is my friend. I will leave everything I work on better than I found it.</p><p>As a growing company, there are plenty of opportunities to pitch in, learn, and develop professionally, and help us&nbsp;reach new levels of greatness, and we're looking for folks who like the sound of that. Drop us a line if you're that person.</p><p># years experience required: years of experience!</p><p>WHEN APPLYING, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE INCLUDE A PARAGRAPH OR TWO ABOUT WHAT MAKES YOU TICK OR WHAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT--RESUMES AREN'T ENOUGH TO GO ON.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/16080?reset=False&amp;ra=5olFkXF3SeI&amp;oqs=a%3D5olFkXF3SeI' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About PayLock</h3>            <div><p>We are profitable AND well-funded 10+ year-old &quot;post-startup&quot; company focused on improving the current options available to municipalities, universities, and the parking enforcement community to quickly, easily, and humanely manage their ever-increasing challenges in parking enforcement--like collecting overdue parking tickets and managing limited parking real-estate while reducing costs. We offer them technologies and services which allow them to do their jobs quickly, easily, and much less painfully than ever before. And we are introducing cutting-edge tools, services and technologies that are literally changing the way people think about parking—from City Hall, which is passing legislation to allow it, to the officers on the street, who are enforcing those laws.

Du kan rätta fel och&nbsp;lägga till features&nbsp;genom att programmera i befintlig teknik, men också vara med och driva utvecklingen för&nbsp;den nya produkten.</p><p>Du gillar förmodligen precis som oss att utforska och använda nya teknologier i utvecklingsarbetet mot framtidens webbapplikationer. Du har själv - på fritiden eller i tidigare jobb - arbetat med hela produkten från design, arkitektur, back-end och front-end till deployment. Kanske har du en publik GitHub med något spännande projekt!?&nbsp;</p><p>Du&nbsp;har erfarenhet av ASP.NET web forms&nbsp;men också intresse av nyare teknologier. Vi gillar&nbsp;och tror att framtiden är att bygga snabba moduler i med frond-end i React.</p><p><strong>Vårt företag<br></strong>På e-Avrop utvecklar vi ett omfattande IT-stöd för upphandling, där svenska och utländska myndigheter, kommuner och företag får hjälp med hela upphandlingsprocessen.</p><p>Vår produkt har mängder av spännande funktionalitet såsom visuella processmodeller, rättighetsstyrd dokumenthantering, och realtidslösning för auktioner. Vi ser också många möjligheter för framtidens utveckling, med både business intelligence, machine learning och annat smart användande av vår samlade data. Allt för att kunna erbjuda nya och bättre tjänster inom området.</p><p>Vårt mål är att utveckla en enkel och kraftfull plattform med stor flexibilitet för upphandlare och företag. Vårt fokus ligger i att användarupplevelsen ska kännas modern, snabb och ha genomtänkt gränssnitt.&nbsp;</p><p>När vi träffas ses vi i trivsamma lokaler på&nbsp;Östermalm i Stockholm, ett stenkast från Tekniska Högskolan. Övrig tid jobbar vi effektivt hemifrån, med dagliga scrum-möten online.</p><p><strong>Arbetsuppgifter</strong><strong><br></strong>Den huvudsakliga arbetsuppgiften är underhåll av den befintliga web-applikationen för upphandlingsstöd samt viss nyutveckling i varierande teknologier. Vi jobbar i korta sprintar med prioriterad backlog.</p><p>Arbetet omfattar hela kedjan från rent underhållsarbete och bug-rättningar till feature requests med design av gränssnitt, datamodell,&nbsp;och teknisk lösning.</p><p>Vår utveckling sker främst i .Net-miljö (ASP.NET web forms) men mycket av våra nyare lösningar innefattar modernare gränssnitt skrivna i React, AngularJS och ren javascript. Vi använder självklart senaste verktygen såsom Visual Studio Resharper/Rider och Webstorm. Vi kör både macOS och Windows och hanterar kod med GitFlow. Vi har ett agilt tänk och har i nuläget en helt automatisk byggprocess och deployment.<br><br><strong>Din profil</strong><br>Vi tror att du är civilingenjör, datavetare eller motsvarande och har arbetat ett par år med systemutveckling. Du är van med att implementera webbservices och andra API:er såsom REST med flera och har goda kunskaper inom webbtekniker. Vidare tror vi att du har erfarenhet inom .NET, ASP web forms, C# och javascriptsbaserade front-end teknologier.&nbsp;</p><p>För att lyckas i rollen tror vi att du är analytiskt lagd, har ett strukturerat arbetssätt med en adaptiv syn på teknologi. Du kan arbeta självständigt och i grupp samt har lätt för att sätta dig in i, förstå och använda nya verktyg och koncept inom systemutveckling. Du behärskar både svenska samt engelska obehindrat i tal och skrift. Vi kommer att lägga stor vikt vid dina personliga egenskaper.</p><p><strong>Din ansökan</strong><br>Stämmer detta in på dig?

Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile or tablet device.</p><p><strong>Who We Need</strong></p><p>Cultural Fit - While we hire all kinds of people and invent roles to fit them, there are three key traits we require of every team member that really define our team.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Fun to Work With - Life is short and work should be fun. &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Extremely Smart - We work on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can both architect and code these systems at the same time while working with a highly intelligent peer group. &nbsp;</li><li>Passionate Engineers - We need people who really love programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in what you do.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Types of Roles</strong></p><p>We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform. &nbsp;Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general &quot;gist&quot; of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast &quot;good enough&quot; approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in &quot;science experiment land&quot;</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>US Person based anywhere in the US (100% remote allowed but no off shore)</li><li>5 Years work experience as a programmer</li><li>Highly Comfortable with C# and Visual Studio</li><li>Experienced with Web Development &amp; JavaScript</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/124860?reset=False&amp;ra=FScjxUoprcQ&amp;oqs=a%3DFScjxUoprcQ' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About MapLarge</h3>            <div><p>MapLarge provides Big Data Analytics and Visualization to make us safer, more productive, and more efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our platform powers high traffic website visualizations, data discovery, and business intelligence applications.

X-Team is a community of like-minded individuals, carefully chosen to ensure that they can become part of the community of the most motivated people in the world who come together to unleash their potential. What we've created is truly special and not merely a faceless platform. X-Team is where developers go to feel truly at home together while becoming more motivated than they've ever been.<br><strong><br>How long does your vetting/interview process take?</strong></p><p>It varies depending on our immediate needs and how quickly you respond to our questions and requests. On average, it takes 1-3 weeks.</p><p>More importantly though, after a decade of interviewing developers, we've learned how important it is to respect people's time. We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p><p><strong>Will I get a job immediately after applying?</strong></p><p>If your skills, experience, and values align with a current opening we have, your chances of getting hired immediately are high. If we discover you're qualified, but all opportunities have been taken, we'll continue to work with you to help you get a role in X-Team.
