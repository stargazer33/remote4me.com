You will have significant autonomy and ability to drive best practices and the direction of the team. We care about the quality of the code we produce and will take the time to improve existing code while adding new functionality. We are passionate about best practices including using test-driven development.\\n\\nWe will provide all the tools needed to do your job and help you in improving your skill base. You will have a key role in developing some new products without undue interference from management as well as:\\n\\n\\n* A chance to work on the latest technologies, including .NET Core\\n\\n* Integrate with the latest developments from Microsoft and Google, including Microsoft Graph and Azure\\n\\n* The ability to drive best practices and processes within the development team\\n\\n* Significant autonomy\\n\\n* Exposure to the full development lifecycle\\n\\n* Training resources and all appropriate technology, software and tools will be provided\\n\\n* Support you in improving your current skill set and to work with and develop new ones\\n\\n* The opportunity to attend some conferences/events/training during the year\\n\\n* A competitive salary, dependent on experience together with pension contributions\\n\\n* Flexibility in working hours when required\\n\\n* The opportunity to get rid of your daily commute\\n\\n* 5 weeks paid holiday per year plus bank holidays\\n\\n* Expenses paid on any business travel\\n\\n* Paid Certification attempts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a fully remote home-based role, although we are looking for UK based developers as there are occasional in-person meetings.\\n\\nWho are we?\\n\\nSalamanderSoft is a small but growing software house providing integration products and services to the education sector in the UK. As part of our growth, we are now looking for enthusiastic C# developers to design, develop and implement our products.\\n\\nOur products integrate school management systems with Active Directory, Office 365, G Suite, SharePoint and other products. Although mainly written in C# they use many different technologies to integrate with all the different systems, from REST and SOAP web APIs to direct database access and custom object models.&nbsp; We use agile methodologies as much as possible. The product set has been developed over the last 12 years and so is quite mature, but there are constant changes as new features are added to the systems we integrate with and as we add support for new products. &nbsp;In addition to our suite of customer-facing products we also produce software using various modern technologies to support our operations team deliver the best experience they can. We also have plans for developing several cloud-based products soon.\\n\\nSalamanderSoft currently consists of 18 employees, the majority of which are operations/support staff. We are a small close-knit company and our ethos is to provide excellent service to our customers and to be the best at what we do. This is reflected in the fact that all our sales are via word of mouth/recommendations – we do not have a sales team, and we are still growing strongly. All our roles are remote working, so you will be working from home.\\n\\nWe have a great reputation with our customers as evidenced by this thread on EduGeek:&nbsp;http://www.edugeek.net/forums/recommended-suppliers/160503-salamandersoft-singing-praises.html\\n\\nWho we are looking for\\n\\nThe current development team consists of 2 full-time developers together with the company founder devoting about half his time to development. We are now looking for additional team members to enable further growth of the company and product set. The role is home-based so you will need to be comfortable and effective working from home. Although home-working sounds great and offers a lot of flexibility, it is not for everybody.\\n\\nThe exact skills we are looking for will depend on your experience, although C# is a core requirement. Your attitude will be key and we will be looking for someone who:\\n\\n\\n* uses their initiative and gets things done\\n\\n* has successfully delivered at least one project\\n\\n* has enthusiasm and interest in development and technology\\n\\n* wants to be the best that they can be and strives for excellence\\n\\n* can work independently and remotely\\n\\n* has a hunger to learn new skills\\n\\n* wants to drive best-practices and processes\\n\\n* for a senior developer, we would also be expecting agile skills, especially test-driven development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs this is a remote role you will need a suitable area for working in your home, a broadband connection and probably a kettle. All other equipment and tools will be provided.\\n\\nAll applicants must be UK based and legally entitled to work in the UK. Also, due to the nature of the sector we work in, we require all employees to be DBS checked.\\n\\nNext Steps\\n\\nIf you are interested in joining our team, please apply through Stack Overflow or write to us at&nbsp;   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span>&nbsp;with anything you want to support your application. Links to social media and code repositories would be great as well.\\n\\nIf you would like more information or an informal chat about the role, please contact Richard Willis,&nbsp;   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span>\\n\\nWe will offer jobs as and when the right candidates apply, so there is no fixed closing date.  </div> </div>",
