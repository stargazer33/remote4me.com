Tasks will involve everything from implementing pages in ASP.NET MVC Razor (HTML+CS+JS) to making backend services. This is a &quot;junior&quot; to &quot;early-career&quot; position. Expect bit variety in tasks, and you can learn a lot!\\n\\nSince we launched Likvido in April 2018, we’ve absolutely nailed it. Not only do we now have 1.000+ customers - among many of the hottest startups and scaleups in Denmark - we also managed to get very serious funding, have very good unit economics and built a really cool technical platform. However, we’re just getting started.\\n\\nSo what are we doing?\\n\\nWe are solving the biggest reason for companies going bankrupt in Europe. You see, 19 % of all invoices are paid late, and roughly half of all bankruptcies are caused by lack of cash.\\n\\nLikvido is defining a new category we’re calling a “customer payment system”. Today you integrate Likvido with your accounting system, and then we automate sending out invoices, send our reminders, start debt collection and post back to the accounting system. Looking ahead, we will add financial products, give the whole organization access to our system and much more. In brief, we help companies get paid - on time - and forecast their cash flow.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n The platform is ~18 months old. We have a big monolith ASP.NET MVC application, combined with 3 solid ASP.NET Core microservices. Everything is hosted in Azure and Github, and we use many of the Azure products, including Azure DevOps. The frontend is based on the &quot;Porto Admin Theme&quot; (typical Bootstrap admin theme), and we use a mix of Vue.js (complex pages) and jQuery (on simple pages).\\n\\nThe job:\\nYou will be tasked to implement MANY different things. Examples:\\n\\n- Implement design files in HTML+CSS+JS (in ASP.NET MVC Razor)\\n- Make (simple) backend services that store data\\n- Fix bugs in solution\\n- Make web-jobs\\n- Improve the user experience\\n- Write unit tests\\n\\nBasically, you will receive a large variety of whatever tasks on the platform. The plan is you will be the most junior on the team, and you will get many of the &quot;simplest tasks&quot; in many different categories\\n \\n\\n# Requirements\\nThis is a &quot;junior&quot; to &quot;early-career&quot; position. So the most important things for us:\\n\\n- You're smart &amp; ambitious\\n- You have some kind of educational background (preferably University) in relation to software development\\n- You will need to have at least a few years of experience in .NET technologies and ASP.NET MVC (full-time experience not required). \\n- You will need to have at least a few years of experience in building JavaScript + HTML + CSS solutions (full-time experience not required)\\n\\nYou're of course welcome to apply if you have more experience. However, expect the salary to reflect the expected role, not your experience. \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

We’re not going to be the next Uber, and we don’t want to be. We like being small and profitable with a great team. We believe in steady growth, quality service and producing an excellent product.</p>\n <p>We produce software that works with English-language documents. Our flagship software, PerfectIt, is an add-in for MS Word that finds mistakes that spelling and grammar checkers won’t find, such as consistency errors and style issues. The English language is a beast! And working to automate proofreading tasks for English is one of the most challenging and interesting aspects of our work.</p>\n <p>We’re at the forefront of proofreading/editing technologies. We were among the first companies to produce apps for Office and add-ons for Google Docs, and we have plans to do more development in these environments as the next generation of word processors takes off.</p>\n <p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Work from Home<br></strong></p>\n <p>Candidates should be based in the United Kingdom. Intelligent Editing has no offices, so candidates should be equipped to work from home.</p>\n <p><strong>Flexible Working</strong></p>\n <p>We have a team call every day between 3pm and 5pm (UK time). All other hours are flexible. If you produce great work, we don’t care when you do it.</p>\n <p><strong>A Life Beyond Programming</strong></p>\n <p>We believe that it’s impossible for developers to work more than forty hours per week and sustain quality. Our founder is a workaholic, but he doesn’t want others doing that! So we work forty hours per week, and we don’t usually do overtime.</p>\n <p>We’re sympathetic to the demands of parenting and welcome applications from experienced professionals who need the flexibility that life with children demands.</p>\n <p><strong>A Stake in Success</strong></p>\n <p>We offer equity in the business so you will own your success. Equity options will be negotiated at the end of the first year.</p>\n <p>Find out more about us at <a href='http://www.intelligentediting.com' rel='nofollow'>www.intelligentediting.com</a></p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Work from home</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Have an equity stake in a startup's success</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible hours</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Small team that listens to you</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>A life beyond programming</span> </li> \n</ul>",

You'll need to do all of this while not breaking our current system. \n  <br> \n  <br>Cool Things we Do \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Every PR has a set of unit tests and&nbsp;automated UI tests&nbsp;run against it. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Every PR is code reviewed. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We have a dedicated QA team to manually check your PR (it requires four testers to sign off). \n  <br> \n  <br>* Every PR that is approved is automatically deployed&nbsp;(CI). \n  <br> \n  <br>* We've got a beta system that has a flow of production data that helps you develop and test your code without worry of breaking things. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Everything is hosted on Azure. There's plenty of dev/beta/test servers and databases to use. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The web team has its own Product Manager. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We run two-week sprints.&nbsp; The web team reviews, estimates, and discusses all sprint issues before they are free to be worked. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We often pair program. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The majority of our engineers are remote. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We have a front-end team that works in Angular 2+ and React (meaning you won't have to&nbsp;do UI work). \n  <br> \n  <br>* We have a skilled design team that handles the HTML/LESS for the website (again, no UI work for you). \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Who&nbsp;We're Looking For \n  <br> \n  <br>We want smart engineers who get shit done! Not only do you have to be smart, you have to be pragmatic. \n  <br> \n  <br>Let's say you need to paint a room white. \n  <br> \n  <br>Smart and Pragmatic Engineer: A pragmatic engineer fills up a sprayer (rather than use a paintbrush), gets to work, and makes sure they don't paint themselves into a corner. \n  <br> \n  <br>Smart Engineer (but not pragmatic): A smart engineer who's not pragmatic might design a system to change the color of the room in just 30 seconds.&nbsp; Sure, it would take 2 months to build the system but we could change colors so quickly!&nbsp; It's totally optimized for repainting! \n  <br> \n  <br>If the second example sounds like you, please do not apply.&nbsp; We know it's fun to go hog wild in projects but we need to &quot;get shit done&quot;.&nbsp; There's a whole line of other engineers and designers waiting for that room to get painted so they can do their own work on it. \n  <br> \n  <br>We're a Team, not a Family \n  <br> \n  <br>It sounds harsh to say, but we're not a Family. I know lots of businesses call themselves&nbsp;a family, but I think it's BS. If you get drunk at work and yell at someone, we're going to let you go (although we would give Grandma a pass at Thanksgiving). \n  <br> \n  <br>It's better to think of TrainerRoad like a sports team. Everyone has their role and their jobs.&nbsp; It's our jobs as managers to bring new hires up to speed, train them in our system, and coach them to be successful. \n  <br> \n  <br>If someone is not performing, we need to talk to them, coach them, find out what's going wrong and where we can improve.&nbsp; If someone just can't perform to the standard level of the team and we can't coach them to get better, we have to let that person go. \n  <br> \n  <br>Another clear sign that you have a high-performance team is that if everyone would &quot;enthusiastically rehire&quot; each other for their current roles.&nbsp; It really makes work wonderful when you respect, trust and value your co-workers. \n  <br> \n  <br>Required Technology Experience \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* C# Experience - Intermediate to Advanced&nbsp;proficiency \n  <br> \n  <br>* Cloud Experience - Azure or AWS \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Optional Technology Experience \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* ASP.net MVC \n  <br> \n  <br>* LINQ \n  <br> \n  <br>* Web API \n  <br> \n  <br>* Azure \n  <br> \n  <br>* SQL \n  <br> \n  <br>* Build/Test CI (We use TeamCity) \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Work Remote or in Reno, Nevada \n  <br> \n  <br>We're looking for the best candidate we can find in the US. Three-quarters of our development&nbsp;team work remotely. It works very well with the help of Slack and Github. \n  <br> \n  <br>We expect remote employees&nbsp;to overlap at least 6 hours with the Reno, Nevada office (we're there 8am-5pm Pacific time). \n  <br> \n  <br>Salary \n  <br> \n  <br>We're looking to hire engineers for&nbsp;110k/year. &nbsp;If you ask for more, we'll reject your application. If you're interested in the company please subscribe to our RSS feed at jobs.trainerroad.com for when a higher level job posting is open. \n  <br> \n  <br>Perks \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Unlimited Vacation \n  <br> \n  <br>* 401k with 4% company matching&nbsp; \n  <br> \n  <br>* 99% of employees individual health care paid (I know 99% is weird...it's an ACA thing, and it ends up being just a few dollars per paycheck) You can see&nbsp;a preview of what you'd pay here:&nbsp;https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27 \n  <br> \n  <br>* Flexible schedule \n  <br> \n  <br>* Access to the latest fitness devices (power meters, trainers, sensors, etc.) \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Your Resume should have: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Links to any open source projects you've contributed to (not required) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Github/StackOverflow username if you'd like \n  <br> \n  <br>* Examples of experience in the &quot;Optional Technology Experience&quot; area \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Your Cover Letter should have: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Let us know why you want to work for TrainerRoad \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>We also Require \n  <br> \n  <br>The best engineers only want to work with other great engineers. We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview. \n  <br> \n  <br>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable. \n  <br> \n  <br>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere. \n  <br> \n  <br>You can find the refactoring exercise with instructions here:&nbsp;https://github.com/trainerroad/BackendRefactorChallenge \n  <br> \n  <br>Excited about our Company? \n  <br> \n  <br>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company. \n  <br> \n  <br>FAQs \n  <br> \n  <br>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply? \n  <br> \n  <br>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user, let us know! \n  <br> \n  <br>What's unlimited vacation mean? \n  <br> \n  <br>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out. \n  <br> \n  <br>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time. \n  <br> \n  <br>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more, and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements, everything else works itself out. \n  <br> \n  <br>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem. \n  <br> \n  <br>How do you work? \n  <br> \n  <br>We're big believers in&nbsp;Deep Work&nbsp;and&nbsp;Flow. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand distraction-free for multiple hours totally.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward. \n  <br> \n  <br>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work. \n  <br> \n  <br>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests. \n  <br> \n  <br>We have partial test coverage, and we're constantly improving in that area. \n  <br> \n  <br>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each App release, and we're continually getting more automated. \n  <br> \n  <br>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster. \n  <br> \n  <br>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels. \n  <br> \n  <br>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up). \n  <br> \n  <br>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play. \n  <br> \n  <br>We often pair program via Slack. \n  <br> \n  <br>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github. \n  <br> \n  <br>Developers get super-fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive, we want to spend the money on it. \n  <br> \n  <br>You didn't ask about education, what's required? \n  <br> \n  <br>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught. \n  <br> \n  <br>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process? \n  <br> \n  <br>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp; \n  <br> \n  <br>If you did follow directions, our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code, and it should be reviewed that way without bias. \n  <br> \n  <br>If we like your refactoring, we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. Nothing super in-depth CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad. \n  <br> \n  <br>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview. \n  <br> \n  <br>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and an engineer. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us. \n  <br> \n  <br>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp; \n  <br> \n  <br>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through, but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard, you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;. \n  <br> \n  <br>What's with the dishes analogy? \n  <br> \n  <br>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud. \n  <br> \n  <br>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk. \n  <br> \n  <br>Want more detail about the benefits? \n  <br> \n  <br>You can see a preview of TrainerRoad's health benefits here:&nbsp;https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27 \n  <br> \n  <br>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end? \n  <br> \n  <br>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise. \n  <br> \n  <br>TrainerRoad is an equal opportunity employer. \n </div> \n</div>",

Join our vision to transform workplace communication as we know it.</p>\n <p>Fuze is a leading unified communications as a service (UCaaS) provider focused on modernizing and simplifying day-to-day business conversations. We unify collaboration technologies like voice, video, and messaging on a single cloud-based platform so users can experience greater efficiency and less hassle each workday. The company is growing rapidly as we move full steam ahead toward our anticipated IPO. Now’s the time to bring your passion and expertise to our Fuze team!</p>\n <p>Our customers use our software across a variety of platforms including Windows, OS X, iOS, Android and web. We build our software to work and provide a great experience across all of these platforms. Whenever possible we use open source technologies like WebRTC or OPAL. Where it makes sense we build our own software stacks. The Real Time Communications team also builds linux-based microservices that provide audio, video, screen share, content, recording and interoperability gateway functions. These microservices use a combination of REST APIs and IETF standards based protocols to provide functionality to our desktop, mobile and web-based clients. These microservices are built with scalability, resiliency and performance in mind.</p>\n <p>The primary task of the Real Time Communications team is to build the heart of our product — the software stacks that power the audio and video communications within our product. This team works across both the client and backend stacks. Within this team you will get exposure to a broad range of technologies and challenges.</p>\n <p>As much as possible we develop cross platform code — sharing code across clients and sometimes between the clients and various backend services. We believe strongly in modularity and code reuse. As we’re developing cross platform code that is often times CPU intensive and performance critical we tend to use C++ as our language of choice for code that requires portability between the clients and servers.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>In this position you will be responsible for owning, developing and maintaining key components in our client media framework or the backend media services.</li>\n  <li>You will develop services that are deployed globally and run in mixed environments including our own datacenters and AWS.</li>\n  <li>You will be responsible for making key technical recommendations and then executing on your recommendations.</li>\n  <li>You will be responsible for coming up with and implementing innovative solution to difficult problems.</li>\n  <li>You must be hands on and have a passion for developing software.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What You Will Need:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Expert C++ coding skills with minimum of 7 years experience</li>\n  <li>Experience with streaming media protocols (SIP, SDP, H.323)</li>\n  <li>Experience developing real-time audio/video communication systems leveraging RTP/RTCP and audio codecs such as Opus, G.711, G.722</li>\n  <li>Experience developing networking software including working with socket level programming and UDP/TCP</li>\n  <li>Experience developing and shipping high quality applications for OS X, Windows, iOS or Android is an asset</li>\n  <li>Experience building production Linux based services is an asset</li>\n  <li>Experience with WebRTC</li>\n  <li>Experience with Go and/or Python is a plus</li>\n  <li>Understanding of the various trade offs when dealing with real-time media</li>\n  <li>Drive, passion, dedication and a good attitude</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://www.fuze.com/careers#!/job/1722664' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

Whether we’re helping developers get answers to their questions or find new jobs, we build products that make millions of developers’ lives better every day. Our goal is to create a community and a company where every developer feels welcome to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers.</p>\n <p>Stack Overflow for Enterprise gives organizations a private, secure home for their team’s questions and answers, as well as a robust set of tools to manage their community. As a full-stack web developer on the Enterprise team, you’ll join a cross-disciplinary team of developers, designers, and product managers working on new and existing features and bugs.</p>\n <p><strong>Recent and upcoming projects include:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Creating a Single Sign-On framework to make authentication as easy as possible for customers.</li>\n  <li>Improving our search algorithms to help developers find the answers they need across both public and private Stack Overflow Q&amp;A.</li>\n  <li>Designing and implementing V2 of Enterprise instance monitoring to ensure that our customers are having an excellent and bug-free experience. The challenge is in reporting general metrics (like exception counts, questions asked and answered counts, etc.) without accessing or transmitting any private or secure customer data or PII.</li>\n  <li>You’ll work primarily in our main tech stack of C#, ASP.NET, and Microsoft SQL Server, with supporting technologies like Redis, TypeScript, and Elasticsearch.</li>\n  <li>The Enterprise team also makes use of Azure and other containerization technologies.</li>\n  <li>If you’re not familiar with our specific tech stack, we’ll pair you with mentors who will help you bridge the gaps.</li>\n  <li>We do expect to see some existing enterprise-level experience in the successful candidate for this role.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>We’re a remote-first team. Whether you work remotely or work out of our New York office, you’ll be part of a remote work culture that emphasizes online communication (Trello, Slack, GitHub, Hangouts, Zoom, Stack Overflow for Teams).</strong> <strong>While we’re generally very flexible on working hours, for this position you’ll need to have a wide coverage of our customers from Europe to West Coast US. As a result you’ll be expected to work roughly New York time zone hours.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>This role also requires occasional flexibility in working hours</strong>. Many of our customers expect software deployments, upgrades, and hotfixes to be installed during off-business hours (such as early mornings or late evenings). In addition, some debugging with customers will occasionally be required, at the convenience of their working hours. These tasks are fairly infrequent (We tend to deploy 3 major releases per year, with a few hotfixes as-needed). We also believe in strong work-life balance and provide comp time during regular working hours for each extra hour worked. The successful candidate should be aware of these expectations and be comfortable with occasionally flexible working hours (and the ensuing flexible time off in lieu). Emergencies and “on call” events are very rare – you should not expect work to intrude on your weekends.</p>\n <p><strong>Skills and Requirements</strong></p>\n <p><strong>We expect to see:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Solid programming skills in your language of choice (not necessarily ours) and a track record of getting stuff done.</li>\n  <li>5+ years full-stack web dev experience with any major server-side stack, relational database, and modern front-end (JS, HTML, CSS). Experience in our stack is a plus, but not a requirement.</li>\n  <li>Prior enterprise-level development and lifecycle experience. You’ve worked on a large enterprise-class product before.</li>\n  <li>Self-motivating, self-directing and a great communicator.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>We like to see (but not required):</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience working remotely and/or working with teams that are distributed geographically.</li>\n  <li>Experience shipping features in a fast-moving, cross-disciplinary team (Product Managers, Designers, UX Researchers, Product Marketing, etc).</li>\n  <li>An active Stack Overflow profile, open source code, example projects that you’re proud of (whether open source or worked on at a previous job), or any other evidence of your passion for building great software.</li>\n  <li>Knowledge of how Stack Overflow works from our blog and podcasts.</li>\n  <li>Experience with Stack Overflow for Teams or Stack Overflow for Enterprise.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>When you apply… </strong>Please include an up-to-date resume. We also strongly encourage you to include a cover letter explaining why you’re interested in working at Stack Overflow.</p>\n <p><strong>What you’ll get in return:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Flexible hours</strong></li>\n  <li>20 days paid vacation + holidays</li>\n  <li>Completely free health insurance – no copay, no premiums (US residents)</li>\n  <li>Generous parental leave (12-16 weeks at 100% pay), family care leave, and unlimited sick days</li>\n  <li>Employees will never be poked with a sharp stick</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>If you want to work remotely…. We’ll help you set up a great home office, with an ergonomic chair, standing desk, and any other equipment you need to do your job.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>If you want to work in our office… </strong>You’ll get your own private office in our headquarters in New York City, and enjoy additional benefits like free lunch every day prepared by our own in-house chefs, transportation reimbursement, and all the espresso you can drink.</p>\n <p><strong>About Stack Overflow</strong></p>\n <p>Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. More than 50 million professional and aspiring programmers visit Stack Overflow each month to help solve coding problems, develop new skills, and find job opportunities.</p>\n <p>We partner with businesses to help them understand, hire, engage, and enable the world’s developers. Our products and services are focused on developer marketing, technical recruiting, market research, and enterprise knowledge sharing.</p>\n <p>We believe in hiring smart people and getting out of their way. We have an office in New York with some of the best amenities of any New York startup, and we have people who work remotely all over the world. We keep meetings and ceremony to an absolute minimum.</p>\n <p><strong>What we value:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Servant Leadership: We lead by empowering and inspiring people to do their best work, not by micromanaging. We hire smart people, set them up for success, then get out of their way.</li>\n  <li>Collaboration: The best products are created when people from different backgrounds and disciplines work closely together in an environment of respect and trust.</li>\n  <li>Transparency: Trust is built on openness and transparency. If there is not a good reason to keep it a secret, we share it. For example, we share our complete engineering salary formula.</li>\n  <li>Inclusion: We do our best work when we can be our whole selves at work. We’re committed to policies and benefits that support people, and leaders who foster an open and inclusive culture.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Diverse teams build better products.</strong></p>\n <p><em>Legally, we need you to know this:</em></p>\n <p>Stack Exchange, Inc. does not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class. We support workplace diversity. Employment is conditioned upon successful completion of a background check and upon having the appropriate legal right to work.</p>\n <p><em>But we want to add this:</em></p>\n <p>We strongly believe that diversity contributes to a broader collective perspective that will consistently lead to a better company and better products. We are working hard to increase the diversity of our team wherever we can and we actively encourage everyone to consider becoming a part of it.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/company/work-here/1715858/senior-full-stack-web-developer-enterprise' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

It includes our document structure reconstruction and document comparison algorithms. Most of this code was written by our founder but, as we have grown, we are looking to hand over responsibility to an experienced engineer.</p>\n <p>You will be spearheading our core technology development. You will start out working closely with our founder making some key improvements to our algorithms. Over time, you will take leadership and become the chief innovator of the technology that sits at the heart of all Draftable products.</p>\n <p>You will spend 90% of your time reading the literature, thinking about how to implement things, and writing code.</p>\n <p><strong>About you</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You are a problem solver and you love learning.</li>\n  <li>You have very strong theoretical and practical knowledge of data structures and algorithms. Maybe you’ve done graduate level study and research, or maybe you’ve been involved in programming competitions like the Informatics Olympiad or Topcoder.</li>\n  <li>Once you figure out how you want to implement something, you write code really fast.</li>\n  <li>You have at least a few years experience working as a software engineer and you pride yourself on writing clean, well-structured and well-tested code.</li>\n  <li>You are independent and self-reliant. You’re happy working on a task by yourself but you will take initiative to involve other team members when necessary.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Work/life balance</strong></p>\n <p>We understand you have a life outside work and we will respect your non-working and family time. We expect engineers to work a full time load of 40 hours per week (and no more) and to be very productive during that time.</p>\n <p><strong>Our team is mostly remote and we prefer working with remote engineers, but also we’re also open to welcoming you into our Melbourne office.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>You will have flexibility to schedule your work around your other obligations but you will usually work at a fixed time. If your work hours don’t have much overlap with Australian business hours, you will need to be flexible with scheduling meetings late at night or early in the morning.</strong></p>\n <p>We don’t need you to be on-call, except for when you push potentially breaking changes. Our service is very stable and we haven’t had any critical incidents that required urgent attention in the last few months.</p>\n <p><strong>Some things you might be doing in your first few months</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Adjust the tuning on our PDF header/footer detection code. Implement a new multilevel Bayesian approach, learning what that is if necessary, and see if it improves performance</li>\n  <li>Hunt down some memory leaks in our PDF processing code</li>\n  <li>Debug a performance issue on a particular set of documents.</li>\n  <li>Design and implement a space-efficient algorithm for comparing documents that are too large to fit in memory.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>About our technical stack</strong></p>\n <p>Our core algorithms and products are written in .NET (mostly C# with some F# and some C++). Otherwise, we have a fairly standard tech stack: Python (Django, Celery, SaltStack), React, PostgreSQL, Redis and RabbitMQ.</p>\n <p>In this role, you’ll mainly be working on C# code but it’s okay if you don’t have so much experience with C#, as we have experts on staff.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://draftable.com/careers/#id_rd_eng' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",
