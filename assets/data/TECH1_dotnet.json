Tunnll is a small, but the international company. In order to communicate effectively with team members who can be located in different countries, we need a shared communication channel. The same is true for our communications with partners and customers in various locations. The English requirement for this position is English 6 / English Course B / IELTS Academic 6.5 or higher / TOEFL iBT total score of 575.

You can even work with your laptop <a href='http://www.webworktravel.com/become-digital-nomad/' rel='nofollow'>from a beach in Thailand</a>, but it is very important that the workplace conditions stay reliable and uninterrupted. All remote team members in Tunnll are required to organize their workplaces to meet the following requirements:</p><ul><li>The workplace should be a single, ideally separated room with no interruptions by noises, other people, etc.</li><li>To allow uninterrupted video calls, a <a href='https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-usb-office-headset/' rel='nofollow'>headset/microphone with a noise cancellation feature</a> should be used.</li><li>The workplace should be connected to a stable high-speed internet connection (at least 100 MB/s) ideally backed up with a secondary connection for redundancy.</li><li>The working computer should have at least 16GB of RAM for engineers and designers and at least 8GB for the rest of roles.</li><li>The working computer should be properly maintained on a regular basis (security updates, disk cleanup, antivirus checks, dust cleaning, etc.).</li></ul>Compensation levels<p>Initial proposal</p><p>The size of the proposed compensation may depend on your experience, demonstrated professional skills and your communication skills. For entry-level positions (no or small experience) we may find it reasonable to propose a level of compensation which is typical for your current location (<a href='https://www.payscale.com/research/ES/Job=Software_Developer/Salary/8224e5c5/Entry-Level-Barcelona' rel='nofollow'>example</a>).</p><p>Growing the compensation rate as we work together </p><p>We are interested in investing in long-term relationships and that is why all compensations are subject to regular increases based on factors like gained experience, overall time spent in the company, number of new books read over the working period and number of the successfully completed online courses.</p>Remote or not?<p>Tunnll is a 100% remote-friendly workplace, but if your preference is teamwork in a modern and comfortable office in a great location, we would be glad to accommodate you in one of our focus locations (currently Barcelona and Madrid in Spain and Milton Keynes in the UK).</p>Why this position is cool<ul><li>Remote from day one. Tunnll has been a remote setup from day one. This means we know what is good for being remote and how to overcome the shortcomings of the distributed setup.</li><li>Flexible schedule. You can work 9 to 5 or at night or early in the morning – or at any other time slots suitable for you as long as they overlap with the working hours of the rest of the team;</li><li>Interesting projects. You will work on <a href='http://tunnll.com/' rel='nofollow'>projects</a> that matter and which make people’s lives better;</li><li>High-quality tools provided. We provide all team members with full access to the high-quality productivity and development products from Microsoft (Office 365, SharePoint, etc.).</li><li>Informal and flexible atmosphere.

The more experience you accumulate over time, the more freedom in decision making you will get.</li></ul>Why you should join<p><a href='http://careers.tunnll.com/' rel='nofollow'>We are</a> a team with a flat organizational structure with each team member <a href='http://tunnll.com/' rel='nofollow'>doing tasks</a> he or she really enjoys doing.

The only recent innovation is around making the calendar view prettier and more useful to the owner. </p><p>The main reason for which we plan our day is because time is the most important commodity in the world. Calendars today are good for recording our daily agenda, but they are terrible at coordinating time with others. We’re focusing on coordinating daily life because that’s where tons of value can be added.

This is not theoretical problem. We proved product/market fit with our MVP and are getting paid for our product. We'd like to accelerate development and growth.</p><p>We are building a distributed team and you can work remotely if you wish.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Javascript, Programming, C#, DevOps</div><div>Compensation</div><div>$0K–$50K<br>5.0%–10.0%</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to FreeBusy</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>What We're Building</h3></div><div><div><p>Calendar usage grew tremendously in the past few years fueled by adoption of cloud services and mobile devices. Unfortunately, appointments are spread across many services and we are still wasting a lot of time in back-and-forth emails or phone calls. It's often impossible to share real-time availability with others because Outlook and Google Calendar don't work cross-company.</p><p>FreeBusy is a scheduling assistant powered by A.I. to coordinate meetings 10x faster with contacts inside and outside your company. You can interact with FreeBusy on the web, smartphone, and desktop, using voice, chat, and email. FreeBusy <br>works with existing calendars (Google, Office 365, Exchange, iCloud, Outlook.com, etc.) and you can link as many as you have (work, personal, school). Easily share unified availability with business contacts whether they use FreeBusy or not.</p><p>Our current focus is to increase enterprise agility when scheduling meetings cross-company.

We're growing steadily and to meet new demands, we’re developing new products that busy city staffers (and our own business) do and will rely on to make their cities better for their citizens. Candidates must have a passion for getting things done and be highly motivated. Candidates must thrive in an entrepreneurial environment and be eager to learn and contribute to the team setting. Ideally, we are seeking a Central-NJ based candidate.</p><p>This position is for a full-time, Software Engineer, who will work semi-autonomously and as a part of a small, but growing, team to design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain web-based, back-office software which runs our business, as well as significant portions of our customers' as well as on-the-street (usually literally) mobile software.</p><p>Our biggest challenges are, by design, behind the scenes, and experienced by our clients (the cities) and our own mobile workforce. We're not so much worried about achieving &quot;web scale&quot; as we are about making people's jobs and lives easier. And if we can add at least dash of whimsy in there, too, all the better!</p><p>PayLock helps cities with those &quot;necessary evil&quot; parts of city governance. We try to make those things less evil, both for the people doing them and the people having them done to them.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Candidates must have: great communication abilities (after all, we're a&nbsp;service company, and you'll inevitably be talking to customers), great problem solving skills, an insatiable curiosity and ability to learn, and an innate commitment to getting things done—or, more precisely, an innate need to not let things go undone. And a sense of humor doesn't hurt, either.</p><p>For starters, you'll need a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Design. Developers on our team also work on and develop database schemas, so you should have experience (and proficiency) with that as well. Since most of what we're doing is web-based, you've gotta know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and knowing how the Internet works work can't hurt you. If you understand that much, you probably know a lot about many other things and are constantly adding to your repertoire. In fact, you might not even be able to stop yourself. That's a characteristic we really, really dig: fast, eager, creative learners.</p><p>The kinds of things you might find yourself working on are:</p><ol><li>Building and/or extending a RESTful web api for an AngularJS web application</li><li>Designing and building business management tools (to help our business and our clients')--things like dashboards, alerts, and other &quot;knowledge radiators&quot;</li><li>Building and/or rebuilding a data movement pipeline (we do lots of data integrations with our clients and other 3rd parties)</li><li>Mobile apps for our in-the-field and on-the-road workforce</li><li>Tools for us, the developers, to make our own lives easier</li></ol><p>It's also important that you can keep two visions alive: the near-term and the long-term. We find ourselves juggling the needs of the business (often the near-term voice) and the needs of ourselves and the systems and applications we own on the business' behalf. You have to be strong enough to deliver on the near-term objectives while putting in that extra 10% to 20% of effort to accomplish our long-term (i.e. 3-year) objectives.

We offer them technologies and services which allow them to do their jobs quickly, easily, and much less painfully than ever before. And we are introducing cutting-edge tools, services and technologies that are literally changing the way people think about parking—from City Hall, which is passing legislation to allow it, to the officers on the street, who are enforcing those laws.

Du kan rätta fel och&nbsp;lägga till features&nbsp;genom att programmera i befintlig teknik, men också vara med och driva utvecklingen för&nbsp;den nya produkten.</p><p>Du gillar förmodligen precis som oss att utforska och använda nya teknologier i utvecklingsarbetet mot framtidens webbapplikationer. Du har själv - på fritiden eller i tidigare jobb - arbetat med hela produkten från design, arkitektur, back-end och front-end till deployment. Kanske har du en publik GitHub med något spännande projekt!?&nbsp;</p><p>Du&nbsp;har erfarenhet av ASP.NET web forms&nbsp;men också intresse av nyare teknologier. Vi gillar&nbsp;och tror att framtiden är att bygga snabba moduler i med frond-end i React.</p><p><strong>Vårt företag<br></strong>På e-Avrop utvecklar vi ett omfattande IT-stöd för upphandling, där svenska och utländska myndigheter, kommuner och företag får hjälp med hela upphandlingsprocessen.</p><p>Vår produkt har mängder av spännande funktionalitet såsom visuella processmodeller, rättighetsstyrd dokumenthantering, och realtidslösning för auktioner. Vi ser också många möjligheter för framtidens utveckling, med både business intelligence, machine learning och annat smart användande av vår samlade data. Allt för att kunna erbjuda nya och bättre tjänster inom området.</p><p>Vårt mål är att utveckla en enkel och kraftfull plattform med stor flexibilitet för upphandlare och företag. Vårt fokus ligger i att användarupplevelsen ska kännas modern, snabb och ha genomtänkt gränssnitt.&nbsp;</p><p>När vi träffas ses vi i trivsamma lokaler på&nbsp;Östermalm i Stockholm, ett stenkast från Tekniska Högskolan. Övrig tid jobbar vi effektivt hemifrån, med dagliga scrum-möten online.</p><p><strong>Arbetsuppgifter</strong><strong><br></strong>Den huvudsakliga arbetsuppgiften är underhåll av den befintliga web-applikationen för upphandlingsstöd samt viss nyutveckling i varierande teknologier. Vi jobbar i korta sprintar med prioriterad backlog.</p><p>Arbetet omfattar hela kedjan från rent underhållsarbete och bug-rättningar till feature requests med design av gränssnitt, datamodell,&nbsp;och teknisk lösning.</p><p>Vår utveckling sker främst i .Net-miljö (ASP.NET web forms) men mycket av våra nyare lösningar innefattar modernare gränssnitt skrivna i React, AngularJS och ren javascript. Vi använder självklart senaste verktygen såsom Visual Studio Resharper/Rider och Webstorm. Vi kör både macOS och Windows och hanterar kod med GitFlow. Vi har ett agilt tänk och har i nuläget en helt automatisk byggprocess och deployment.<br><br><strong>Din profil</strong><br>Vi tror att du är civilingenjör, datavetare eller motsvarande och har arbetat ett par år med systemutveckling. Du är van med att implementera webbservices och andra API:er såsom REST med flera och har goda kunskaper inom webbtekniker. Vidare tror vi att du har erfarenhet inom .NET, ASP web forms, C# och javascriptsbaserade front-end teknologier.&nbsp;</p><p>För att lyckas i rollen tror vi att du är analytiskt lagd, har ett strukturerat arbetssätt med en adaptiv syn på teknologi. Du kan arbeta självständigt och i grupp samt har lätt för att sätta dig in i, förstå och använda nya verktyg och koncept inom systemutveckling. Du behärskar både svenska samt engelska obehindrat i tal och skrift. Vi kommer att lägga stor vikt vid dina personliga egenskaper.</p><p><strong>Din ansökan</strong><br>Stämmer detta in på dig?

Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile or tablet device.</p><p><strong>Who We Need</strong></p><p>Cultural Fit - While we hire all kinds of people and invent roles to fit them, there are three key traits we require of every team member that really define our team.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Fun to Work With - Life is short and work should be fun. &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Extremely Smart - We work on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can both architect and code these systems at the same time while working with a highly intelligent peer group. &nbsp;</li><li>Passionate Engineers - We need people who really love programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in what you do.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Types of Roles</strong></p><p>We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform. &nbsp;Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general &quot;gist&quot; of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines.
