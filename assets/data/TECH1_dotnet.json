Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Do you like the thought of fighting cybercrime at scale, watching fraudsters struggle against your defenses, while protecting over a hundred million user accounts?</p><p>Fraud is an ongoing concern among restaurant brands, and we aim to make fraud defense a competitive advantage in our product offerings. We’re looking for a software engineer to help fight fraud on behalf of our clients. You’ll be responsible for detecting, fighting, and preventing: credit card fraud, account takeover attacks, gift card enumeration attacks, and distributed botnet attacks of various kinds.</p><p>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Responsibilities include:</strong></p><ul><li>Sharpening our credit card fraud prevention service, Shield.</li><li>Enhancing customer frontends to encourage good security practices.</li><li>Improving monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity in our applications.</li><li>Creating automation to respond to fraud reports in an efficient and professional manner.</li><li>Evaluating and integrating with third party service providers.</li><li>Building visualizations and reporting tools for our clients.</li><li>Advising development teams to ensure anti-fraud measures are in place.</li></ul><p>This is a full stack engineer position. Your work will span all layers across multiple projects in a large, distributed system. Our tech stack includes C#, F#, Ember, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, Datadog, SumoLogic, Cloudflare, and a number of AWS services including Redshift, SQS, S3 &amp; Kinesis Firehose. We don’t expect candidates to be familiar with all of these technologies, but in this role you will gain experience with most of them.</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>An ability to put yourself in a fraudster’s shoes and think like they do, so you know what we are up against.</li><li>An ability to work well with others. You will be working in the codebases of many teams. You will need to communicate well and minimize disruption.</li><li>At least 3 years of professional experience as a full stack software engineer.</li><li>Proficient in multiple programming languages, frameworks, databases, and OS’s.</li></ul><p><strong>Beneficial:</strong></p><ul><li>A background in fraud or security.</li><li>Machine Learning expertise.</li><li>Experience working on SaaS products or distributed systems.</li><li>Experience with PII security frameworks such as NIST 800-122.</li><li>Experience with any technologies in our technology stack (.NET, AWS, etc.)</li></ul><p><strong>About Olo</strong></p><p>Olo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 200 restaurant brands. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded user interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded website and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller. &nbsp;We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

You can even work with your laptop <a href='http://www.webworktravel.com/become-digital-nomad/' rel='nofollow'>from a beach in Thailand</a>, but it is very important that the workplace conditions stay reliable and uninterrupted. All remote team members in Tunnll are required to organize their workplaces to meet the following requirements:</p><ul><li>The workplace should be a single, ideally separated room with no interruptions by noises, other people, etc.</li><li>To allow uninterrupted video calls, a <a href='https://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-usb-office-headset/' rel='nofollow'>headset/microphone with a noise cancellation feature</a> should be used.</li><li>The workplace should be connected to a stable high-speed internet connection (at least 100 MB/s) ideally backed up with a secondary connection for redundancy.</li><li>The working computer should have at least 16GB of RAM for engineers and designers and at least 8GB for the rest of roles.</li><li>The working computer should be properly maintained on a regular basis (security updates, disk cleanup, antivirus checks, dust cleaning, etc.).</li></ul>Compensation levels<p><br></p><p>The size of the proposed compensation may depend on your experience, demonstrated professional skills and your communication skills. For entry-level positions (no or small experience) we may find it reasonable to propose a level of compensation which is typical for your current location (<a href='https://www.payscale.com/research/ES/Job=Software_Developer/Salary/8224e5c5/Entry-Level-Barcelona' rel='nofollow'>example</a>).<br></p><p>Growing the compensation rate as we work together </p><p>We are interested in investing in long-term relationships and that is why all compensations are subject to regular increases based on factors like gained experience, overall time spent in the company, number of new books read over the working period and number of the successfully completed online courses.</p>Remote or not?<p>Tunnll is a 100% remote-friendly workplace, but if your preference is teamwork in a modern and comfortable office in a great location, we would be glad to accommodate you in one of our focus locations (currently Barcelona and Madrid in Spain and Milton Keynes in the UK).</p>Why this position is cool<ul><li>Remote from day one. Tunnll has been a remote setup from day one. This means we know what is good for being remote and how to overcome the shortcomings of the distributed setup.</li><li>Flexible schedule. You can work 9 to 5 or at night or early in the morning – or at any other time slots suitable for you as long as they overlap with the working hours of the rest of the team;</li><li>Interesting projects. You will work on <a href='http://tunnll.com/' rel='nofollow'>projects</a> that matter and which make people’s lives better;</li><li>High-quality tools provided. We provide all team members with full access to the high-quality productivity and development products from Microsoft (Office 365, SharePoint, etc.).</li><li>Informal and flexible atmosphere. Do you have a suit? Good, you do not need one at this position;</li><li>Your voice can be heard. The more experience you accumulate over time, the more freedom in decision making you will get.</li></ul>Why you should join<p><a href='http://careers.tunnll.com/' rel='nofollow'>We are</a> a team with a flat organizational structure with each team member <a href='http://tunnll.com/' rel='nofollow'>doing tasks</a> he or she really enjoys doing.

Du kan rätta fel och&nbsp;lägga till features&nbsp;genom att programmera i befintlig teknik, men också vara med och driva utvecklingen för&nbsp;den nya produkten.</p><p>Du gillar förmodligen precis som oss att utforska och använda nya teknologier i utvecklingsarbetet mot framtidens webbapplikationer. Du har själv - på fritiden eller i tidigare jobb - arbetat med hela produkten från design, arkitektur, back-end och front-end till deployment. Kanske har du en publik GitHub med något spännande projekt!?&nbsp;</p><p>Du&nbsp;har erfarenhet av ASP.NET web forms&nbsp;men också intresse av nyare teknologier. Vi gillar&nbsp;och tror att framtiden är att bygga snabba moduler i med frond-end i React.</p><p><strong>Vårt företag<br></strong>På e-Avrop utvecklar vi ett omfattande IT-stöd för upphandling, där svenska och utländska myndigheter, kommuner och företag får hjälp med hela upphandlingsprocessen.</p><p>Vår produkt har mängder av spännande funktionalitet såsom visuella processmodeller, rättighetsstyrd dokumenthantering, och realtidslösning för auktioner. Vi ser också många möjligheter för framtidens utveckling, med både business intelligence, machine learning och annat smart användande av vår samlade data. Allt för att kunna erbjuda nya och bättre tjänster inom området.</p><p>Vårt mål är att utveckla en enkel och kraftfull plattform med stor flexibilitet för upphandlare och företag. Vårt fokus ligger i att användarupplevelsen ska kännas modern, snabb och ha genomtänkt gränssnitt.&nbsp;</p><p>När vi träffas ses vi i trivsamma lokaler på&nbsp;Östermalm i Stockholm, ett stenkast från Tekniska Högskolan. Övrig tid jobbar vi effektivt hemifrån, med dagliga scrum-möten online.</p><p><strong>Arbetsuppgifter</strong><strong><br></strong>Den huvudsakliga arbetsuppgiften är underhåll av den befintliga web-applikationen för upphandlingsstöd samt viss nyutveckling i varierande teknologier. Vi jobbar i korta sprintar med prioriterad backlog.</p><p>Arbetet omfattar hela kedjan från rent underhållsarbete och bug-rättningar till feature requests med design av gränssnitt, datamodell,&nbsp;och teknisk lösning.</p><p>Vår utveckling sker främst i .Net-miljö (ASP.NET web forms) men mycket av våra nyare lösningar innefattar modernare gränssnitt skrivna i React, AngularJS och ren javascript. Vi använder självklart senaste verktygen såsom Visual Studio Resharper/Rider och Webstorm. Vi kör både macOS och Windows och hanterar kod med GitFlow. Vi har ett agilt tänk och har i nuläget en helt automatisk byggprocess och deployment.<br><br><strong>Din profil</strong><br>Vi tror att du är civilingenjör, datavetare eller motsvarande och har arbetat ett par år med systemutveckling. Du är van med att implementera webbservices och andra API:er såsom REST med flera och har goda kunskaper inom webbtekniker. Vidare tror vi att du har erfarenhet inom .NET, ASP web forms, C# och javascriptsbaserade front-end teknologier.&nbsp;</p><p>För att lyckas i rollen tror vi att du är analytiskt lagd, har ett strukturerat arbetssätt med en adaptiv syn på teknologi. Du kan arbeta självständigt och i grupp samt har lätt för att sätta dig in i, förstå och använda nya verktyg och koncept inom systemutveckling.

Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile or tablet device.</p><p><strong>Who We Need</strong></p><p>Cultural Fit - While we hire all kinds of people and invent roles to fit them, there are three key traits we require of every team member that really define our team.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Fun to Work With - Life is short and work should be fun. &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Extremely Smart - We work on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can both architect and code these systems at the same time while working with a highly intelligent peer group. &nbsp;</li><li>Passionate Engineers - We need people who really love programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in what you do.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Types of Roles</strong></p><p>We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform. &nbsp;Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general &quot;gist&quot; of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast &quot;good enough&quot; approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in &quot;science experiment land&quot;</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>US Person based anywhere in the US (100% remote allowed but no off shore)</li><li>5 Years work experience as a programmer</li><li>Highly Comfortable with C# and Visual Studio</li><li>Experienced with Web Development &amp; JavaScript</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/124860?reset=False&amp;ra=FScjxUoprcQ&amp;oqs=a%3DFScjxUoprcQ' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About MapLarge</h3>            <div><p>MapLarge provides Big Data Analytics and Visualization to make us safer, more productive, and more efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our platform powers high traffic website visualizations, data discovery, and business intelligence applications.

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Do you like the thought of fighting cybercrime at scale, watching fraudsters struggle against your defenses, while protecting over a hundred million user accounts?</p><p>Fraud is an ongoing concern among restaurant brands, and we aim to make fraud defense a competitive advantage in our product offerings. We’re looking for a software engineer to help fight fraud on behalf of our clients. You’ll be responsible for detecting, fighting, and preventing: credit card fraud, account takeover attacks, gift card enumeration attacks, and distributed botnet attacks of various kinds.</p><p>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Responsibilities include:</strong></p><ul><li>Sharpening our credit card fraud prevention service, Shield.</li><li>Enhancing customer frontends to encourage good security practices.</li><li>Improving monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity in our applications.</li><li>Creating automation to respond to fraud reports in an efficient and professional manner.</li><li>Evaluating and integrating with third party service providers.</li><li>Building visualizations and reporting tools for our clients.</li><li>Advising development teams to ensure anti-fraud measures are in place.</li></ul><p>This is a full stack engineer position. Your work will span all layers across multiple projects in a large, distributed system. Our tech stack includes C#, F#, Ember, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, Datadog, SumoLogic, Cloudflare, and a number of AWS services including Redshift, SQS, S3 &amp; Kinesis Firehose. We don’t expect candidates to be familiar with all of these technologies, but in this role you will gain experience with most of them.</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>An ability to put yourself in a fraudster’s shoes and think like they do, so you know what we are up against.</li><li>An ability to work well with others. You will be working in the codebases of many teams. You will need to communicate well and minimize disruption.</li><li>At least 3 years of professional experience as a full stack software engineer.</li><li>Proficient in multiple programming languages, frameworks, databases, and OS’s.</li></ul><p><strong>Beneficial:</strong></p><ul><li>A background in fraud or security.</li><li>Machine Learning expertise.</li><li>Experience working on SaaS products or distributed systems.</li><li>Experience with PII security frameworks such as NIST 800-122.</li><li>Experience with any technologies in our technology stack (.NET, AWS, etc.)</li></ul><p><strong>About Olo</strong></p><p>Olo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 200 restaurant brands. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded user interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly.

Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller. &nbsp;We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

Running such a platform is not for the faint of heart.</p><p>Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry, full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a relatively small team of smart, senior engineers who all get along.&nbsp;</p><p>We're super DevOps oriented and like to automate and build tools for everything. We use Continuous Integration and push frequently.&nbsp;</p><p>We dedicate time to refactoring to reduce technical debt and to introduce newer technologies.
