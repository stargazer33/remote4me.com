This individual/position is dedicated to the road usage charging business unit. This is a startup and this role will get to shape the technology that is used for the products that get developed. This role will work very close to the operations director, the business unit leader and the engineering team. That paragraph above is general blather and doesn’t really say a lot, so, here is the deal/role in a nutshell What we are doing? -Startup within a startup. Fleet management is the main product that Azuga makes, but that’s not what my team does. We do RUC. -What is RUC? Road usage charging is the following Taxes for roads come from fuel taxes. Fuel taxes are going down due to EV’s and high efficiency vehicles. States need to find an alternative to the fuel tax. Thus – road usage charging -My team has built a system to provide RUC services to states. We have been doing this since 2014. First production launch of product was July 2015 in Oregon. We are on our 11th project. We have done projects in CA, CO, WA, HI. -Oregon is going mandate next year -we do all of our engineering in India, but we are expanding and we need a US based engineer here in Colorado What is the role? If you like to get involved in the full stack of a technology product. If you get bored doing the same thing day in and day out. If you like to work directly with the business to solve real world problems with creative and innovative technology solutions.. then this is the job for you.- We need an engineer here in the US to handle US based engineering/development/reporting/technology… needs. -Role could very well grow into a senior level role in this business unit. -Role will very likely start out as a technology jack of all trades. We need someone on the team that can handle the technology aspects of what we are working on that need to be done in US time. Things like oPartner integration oDatabase architecture oReporting/business intelligence oCode review / a little coding if necessary oMentoring junior engineers (if needed) oWhat this role is not -heads down coding or a single purpose discipline -Will start out as a contract for hire – if everything goes well (you like the job). Role will turn into a permanent team position. -Role is work from home based – we do not have an office in CO anymore. Might in the future, but not right now. Need to be a self starter and can work on your own at your home easily. Must have a place you can work from in your house. – ie can close the door and keep the dogs and kids out when on conference calls. And there will be daily conference calls. Still interested?

You'll also be committed to bringing Rio software to the next level of performance, resiliency, stability and supportability.</p><p>Almost all of the projects we work on are some form of web application and therefore as a full stack developer, you'll be as comfortable writing complex SQL queries as you are styling pages with CSS or making them more dynamic with React components.</p><p>We're a client facing business and so you will need to communicate with customers over various channels including face to face. Customer relationships are very important to us and keeping customers informed of progress and helping them to define the requirements are just as important, if not more so than the code itself.</p><p>Software development for us isn't just about writing new code, we support systems that we've written for many years after development on them has completed so you should be kind of person that gets just as much job satisfaction from fixing bugs or adding features to existing projects as you do from working on greenfield projects.&nbsp;</p><p>We work remotely yet we collaborate a lot so you'll be expected to help others to complete their work and seek help from others when you need it too. This extends to an ongoing commitment to learning, with old and new technologies willingly learned as necessary to perform well in the role and new knowledge keenly shared with your colleagues.</p><p><strong>Technical Competencies</strong></p><ul><li>5 years+ working with .NET (C#) in a web application context (including .NET Core)</li><li>5 years+ working with&nbsp;SQL (MSSQL or MySQL/MariaDB preferred)</li><li>5 years+ working with common front-end technologies</li></ul><p><strong>Core Competencies</strong></p><ul><li>Collaboration – Leverage our collective genius, be a team.</li><li>Transparency – Be real.

deliverables and sprints and keep the velocity even. &nbsp;We rarely work weekends (ok, sometimes if we have a good idea) and we try to keep things flexible. &nbsp;</p><p>This means you&nbsp;get to see your&nbsp;kids school plays and games, you can run errands when there's no traffic and so on. &nbsp;So if you are someone who can manage flexibility and still get your stuff done then we are a good fit. &nbsp;If you need a lot of structure and a boss who delights in holding&nbsp;your nose to the grindstone we wish you the best of luck.</p><p>It's a trade-off. &nbsp;We don't have as much collegiality as other places. &nbsp;We are just a solid place to do good work and feel good about the work you do.</p><p>We also have a very strict no a**holes policy. &nbsp;That goes for both clients and staff. &nbsp;We avoid clients who are not nice people. &nbsp;It's better that way. &nbsp;We are also fairly diverse. Come from different places, with different faces. &nbsp;But we&nbsp;all agree that being honest, direct, and decent is by far the simplest way for professionals to act. &nbsp;And when we fail we hope&nbsp;you'll tell us in an honest, direct, and decent way. &nbsp;And then work with us to improve.</p><p>A lot of our clients are in the public sector and we try to deliver value by helping our clients be more agile and get things done by cutting through their bureaucracy. &nbsp;We believe very much in the power of agile methods and practice them both at work and in our private lives. &nbsp;We hope you join us.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible work arrangements</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>High end hardware</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Time for side projects</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We're looking for smart software engineers who &quot;get things done.&quot; We’re interested in remote candidates in the USA or candidates interested in working in our Reno office.</p><p>Areas of work include ASP.NET MVC Backend, API, Workers, Micro Services, MS SQL Azure, Azure Queues/Tables, Azure Blob Storage, SignalR, and ASP.NET Core (on our roadmap), Azure monitoring and administration.</p><p>We're looking to hire:&nbsp;1x Web Backend Developer</p><p><strong>Web Development</strong></p><p>You'd be joining other engineers who are focused on the backend of our website.</p><p>The backend team is the&nbsp;hub between our apps (iOS/Android/PC/Mac), front-end website and data storage. We have a massive amount of data, and it's very likely that you might queue up tens of millions of items to be processed quickly and efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll also manage integrations&nbsp;with external APIs. You'll need to do all of this while not breaking our current system.</p><p><strong>Cool Things we Do</strong></p><ul><li>Every PR has a set of unit tests and&nbsp;automated UI tests&nbsp;run against it.</li><li>Every PR is code reviewed.</li><li>We have a dedicated QA team to manually check your PR (it requires four testers to sign off).</li><li>Every PR that is approved is automatically deployed&nbsp;(CI).</li><li>We've got a beta system that has a flow of production data that helps you develop and test your code without worry of breaking things.</li><li>Everything is hosted on Azure. There's plenty of dev/beta/test servers and databases to use.</li><li>The web team has its own Product Manager.</li><li>We run two-week sprints.&nbsp; The web team reviews, estimates, and discusses all sprint issues before they are free to be worked.</li><li>We often pair program.</li><li>The majority of our engineers are remote.</li><li>We have a front-end team that works in Angular 2+ and React (meaning you won't have to&nbsp;do UI work).</li><li>We have a skilled design team that handles the HTML/LESS for the website (again, no UI work for you).</li></ul><p><strong>Who&nbsp;We're Looking For</strong></p><p>We want smart engineers who get shit done! Not only do you have to be smart, you have to be pragmatic.</p><p>Let's say you need to paint a room white.</p><p>Smart and Pragmatic Engineer: A pragmatic engineer fills up a sprayer (rather than use a paintbrush), gets to work, and makes sure they don't paint themselves into a corner.</p><p>Smart Engineer (but not pragmatic): A smart engineer who's not pragmatic might design a system to change the color of the room in just 30 seconds.&nbsp; Sure, it would take 2 months to build the system but we could change colors so quickly!&nbsp; It's totally optimized for repainting!</p><p>If the second example sounds like you, please do not apply.&nbsp; We know it's fun to go hog wild in projects but we need to &quot;get shit done&quot;.&nbsp; There's a whole line of other engineers and designers waiting for that room to get painted so they can do their own work on it.</p><p><strong>We're a Team, not a Family</strong></p><p>It sounds harsh to say, but we're not a Family. I know lots of businesses call themselves&nbsp;a family, but I think it's BS. If you get drunk at work and yell at someone, we're going to let you go (although we would give Grandma a pass at Thanksgiving).</p><p>It's better to think of TrainerRoad like a sports team. Everyone has their role and their jobs.&nbsp; It's our jobs as managers to bring new hires up to speed, train them in our system, and coach them to be successful.</p><p>If someone is not performing, we need to talk to them, coach them, find out what's going wrong and where we can improve.&nbsp; If someone just can't perform to the standard level of the team and we can't coach them to get better, we have to let that person go.</p><p>Another clear sign that you have a high-performance team is that if everyone would &quot;enthusiastically rehire&quot; each other for their current roles.&nbsp; It really makes work wonderful when you respect, trust and value your co-workers.</p><p><strong>Required Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>C# Experience - Intermediate to Advanced&nbsp;proficiency</li><li>Cloud Experience - Azure or AWS</li></ul><p><strong>Optional Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>ASP.net MVC</li><li>LINQ</li><li>Web API</li><li>Azure</li><li>SQL</li><li>Build/Test CI (We use TeamCity)</li></ul><p><strong>Work Remote or in Reno, Nevada</strong></p><p>We're looking for the best candidate we can find in the US. Three-quarters of our development&nbsp;team work remotely. It works very well with the help of Slack and Github.</p><p>We expect remote employees&nbsp;to overlap at least 6 hours with the Reno, Nevada office (we're there 8am-5pm Pacific time).</p><p><strong>Salary</strong></p><p>We're looking to hire engineers for&nbsp;110k/year. &nbsp;If you ask for more, we'll reject your application.

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><p>You can find the refactoring exercise with instructions here:&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/trainerroad/BackendRefactorChallenge' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/trainerroad/BackendRefactorChallenge</a></p><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user, let us know!</p><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more, and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements, everything else works itself out.</p><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><p>We're big believers in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692' rel='nofollow'>Deep Work</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance-ebook/dp/B00BW54XVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511803668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman' rel='nofollow'>Flow</a>. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand distraction-free for multiple hours totally.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward.</p><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><p>We have partial test coverage, and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each App release, and we're continually getting more automated.</p><p>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><p>We often pair program via Slack.</p><p>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.</p><p>Developers get super-fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive, we want to spend the money on it.</p><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught.</p><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><p>If you did follow directions, our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code, and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><p>If we like your refactoring, we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. Nothing super in-depth CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.</p><p>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and an engineer. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through, but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard, you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;.</p><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><p><strong>Want more detail about the benefits?</strong></p><p>You can see a preview of TrainerRoad's health benefits here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27' rel='nofollow'>https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27</a></p><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><p>Right now!

Tasks will involve everything from implementing pages in ASP.NET MVC Razor (HTML+CS+JS) to making backend services. This is a &quot;junior&quot; to &quot;early-career&quot; position. Expect bit variety in tasks, and you can learn a lot!\\n\\nSince we launched Likvido in April 2018, we’ve absolutely nailed it. Not only do we now have 1.000+ customers - among many of the hottest startups and scaleups in Denmark - we also managed to get very serious funding, have very good unit economics and built a really cool technical platform. However, we’re just getting started.\\n\\nSo what are we doing?\\n\\nWe are solving the biggest reason for companies going bankrupt in Europe. You see, 19 % of all invoices are paid late, and roughly half of all bankruptcies are caused by lack of cash.\\n\\nLikvido is defining a new category we’re calling a “customer payment system”. Today you integrate Likvido with your accounting system, and then we automate sending out invoices, send our reminders, start debt collection and post back to the accounting system. Looking ahead, we will add financial products, give the whole organization access to our system and much more. In brief, we help companies get paid - on time - and forecast their cash flow.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n The platform is ~18 months old. We have a big monolith ASP.NET MVC application, combined with 3 solid ASP.NET Core microservices. Everything is hosted in Azure and Github, and we use many of the Azure products, including Azure DevOps. The frontend is based on the &quot;Porto Admin Theme&quot; (typical Bootstrap admin theme), and we use a mix of Vue.js (complex pages) and jQuery (on simple pages).\\n\\nThe job:\\nYou will be tasked to implement MANY different things. Examples:\\n\\n- Implement design files in HTML+CSS+JS (in ASP.NET MVC Razor)\\n- Make (simple) backend services that store data\\n- Fix bugs in solution\\n- Make web-jobs\\n- Improve the user experience\\n- Write unit tests\\n\\nBasically, you will receive a large variety of whatever tasks on the platform. The plan is you will be the most junior on the team, and you will get many of the &quot;simplest tasks&quot; in many different categories\\n \\n\\n# Requirements\\nThis is a &quot;junior&quot; to &quot;early-career&quot; position. So the most important things for us:\\n\\n- You're smart &amp; ambitious\\n- You have some kind of educational background (preferably University) in relation to software development\\n- You will need to have at least a few years of experience in .NET technologies and ASP.NET MVC (full-time experience not required). \\n- You will need to have at least a few years of experience in building JavaScript + HTML + CSS solutions (full-time experience not required)\\n\\nYou're of course welcome to apply if you have more experience. However, expect the salary to reflect the expected role, not your experience. \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

The role involves designing and implementing mobile and desktop applications that integrate with our telecoms platform through open standards, as well as proprietary APIs. The emphasis will be on providing clean, functional and friendly user interfaces, while maintaining a robust design.   <br>   <br>Our ideal candidate is a software developer with a lot of attention to detail and who takes pride in writing clean code. If you find yourself mentally processing corner cases as you go through a design, then this is a sure sign we would be very interested to hear from you. The ambition to learn new things and continuously improve is a requirement. We are looking for someone to join us for the long term in providing the best possibles services to our customers.   <br>   <br>Voipfone runs a virtual office, meaning all our employees work from home (09:00 to 17:30 UK time), so self-motivation and reliability are essential qualities. We will supply all the computer equipment, telephony and Internet services required, and you must have a secure and quiet space in your home from which to work.   <br>   <br>Benefits   <br>   <br>   <br>* Home Based Role   <br>   <br>* Company Profit Share (not capped)   <br>   <br>* Performance Based Bonus   <br>   <br>* Free Telecoms Services   <br>   <br>* Free Broadband   <br>   <br>* Full 1 hour lunch   <br>   <br>* 33 days Holiday   <br>   <br>* Holiday Buy Back Scheme   <br>   <br>* Well Days Incentive Scheme   <br>   <br>* Day off on your birthday (or nearest working day)   <br>   <br>* Supplied equipment including iMac and iPhone   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Responsibilities   <br>   <br>You will be reporting to and working closely with the Systems Architect in the design phases of the projects. You will need to familiarise yourself with our telecoms platform and the features it provides, as well as the open standards (SIP and related technologies) on which it is built, and work mostly independently on implementing the software solutions you helped to shape.   <br>   <br>You will be involved in the full life-cycle of the projects, from design to release and ongoing maintenance. You will be responsible for writing documentation, as well as liaising with colleagues in the support teams to ensure end-users are provided with the best possible experience.   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>   <br>Given the nature of the projects you’ll be working on, you will require a good understanding of the following:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Programming GUIs   <br>   <br>* Cross-platform development   <br>   <br>* iOS development   <br>   <br>* Android development   <br>   <br>* macOS development   <br>   <br>* Windows development   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>While not essential, the following skills would certainly prove useful:   <br>   <br>   <br>* An eye for GUI design   <br>   <br>* Experience with frameworks such as React Native   <br>   <br>* Git version control   <br>   <br>* Knowledge of various network protocols   <br>   <br>* SIP   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>STRICTLY NO RECRUITMENT AGENCIES  </div> </div>",

We're looking for a .NET&nbsp;Senior Developer to join our team. You will be instrumental in keeping our offshore developers moving quickly and cranking out high-quality code. \n  <br> \n  <br>In this role, you'll be the one &quot;making sure we build the software right,&quot; providing strategic guidance and oversight to offshore software engineers located in Eastern Europe. This is not a day to day tactical coding role. This is a strategic role where you'll leverage your experience to help more junior software engineers perform at the top of their game. \n  <br> \n  <br>Responsibilities include: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work closely with the Product Owner on the project to understand the overall vision of the product. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Perform technical research to determine how to accomplish application business goals, for example, third-party APIs, open-source plugins, JavaScript libraries, etc. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Have developers create small research projects when necessary to prove out new concepts and ideas. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Write a high-level technical implementation strategy when developers need specific guidance for a new story. This is typically a one- to two-page document in the project Wiki that describes classes, interfaces, unit tests, etc. This is designed to help the developers avoid going down a wrong path and speed up their work. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Answer technical developer questions and help them solve problems. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Perform code reviews to ensure software engineers are attaining proper code coverage, writing code to our standards, and implementing architectural patterns consistent with our approach. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>This is a role for a dynamic individual who has lots of software development experience but does not want to be heads-down cutting production code. Again, this is not a coding role; it's a strategic oversight and mentoring role. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our teams work virtually. You&nbsp;must be located within an hour from Portsmouth, NH or Boston, MA as you'll need to be available once per week at client locations.&nbsp; \n  <br> \n  <br>The ideal candidate will have experience with the following technologies and techniques: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Test-driven development (TDD) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Standard design patterns/Gang of Four \n  <br> \n  <br>* ASP.NET Core 2 and RESTful APIs \n  <br> \n  <br>* Angular 2 and later and/or React \n  <br> \n  <br>* Git and Git Flow \n  <br> \n  <br>* Azure \n  <br> \n  <br>* NUnit \n  <br> \n  <br>* Jasmine and Karma \n  <br> \n  <br>* NSubstitute, Moq or similar isolation framework \n  <br> \n  <br>* Bitbucket Pipelines, Bamboo, Jenkins, Azure Deployment, or similar CI/CD tools \n  <br> \n  <br>* Microservices technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>TO APPLY: \n  <br> To apply, please upload your resume along with a cover letter detailing your interest and related experience to the position, and your compensation requirements.

We're looking for a .NET&nbsp;Senior Developer to join our team. You will be instrumental in keeping our offshore developers moving quickly and cranking out high-quality code.</p>\n <p>In this role, you'll be the one &quot;making sure we build the software right,&quot; providing strategic guidance and oversight to offshore software engineers located in Eastern Europe. This is not a day to day tactical coding role. This is a strategic role where you'll leverage your experience to help more junior software engineers perform at the top of their game.</p>\n <p>Responsibilities include:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Work closely with the Product Owner on the project to understand the overall vision of the product.</li>\n  <li>Perform technical research to determine how to accomplish application business goals, for example, third-party APIs, open-source plugins, JavaScript libraries, etc.</li>\n  <li>Have developers create small research projects when necessary to prove out new concepts and ideas.</li>\n  <li>Write a high-level technical implementation strategy when developers need specific guidance for a new story. This is typically a one- to two-page document in the project Wiki that describes classes, interfaces, unit tests, etc. This is designed to help the developers avoid going down a wrong path and speed up their work.</li>\n  <li>Answer technical developer questions and help them solve problems.</li>\n  <li>Perform code reviews to ensure software engineers are attaining proper code coverage, writing code to our standards, and implementing architectural patterns consistent with our approach.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>This is a role for a dynamic individual who has lots of software development experience but does not want to be heads-down cutting production code. Again, this is not a coding role; it's a strategic oversight and mentoring role.</p>\n <p>Our teams work virtually. You&nbsp;must be located within an hour from Portsmouth, NH or Boston, MA as you'll need to be available once per week at client locations.&nbsp;</p>\n <p><strong>The ideal candidate will have experience with the following technologies and techniques:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Test-driven development (TDD)</li>\n  <li>Standard design patterns/Gang of Four</li>\n  <li>ASP.NET Core 2 and RESTful APIs</li>\n  <li>Angular 2 and later and/or React</li>\n  <li>Git and Git Flow</li>\n  <li>Azure</li>\n  <li>NUnit</li>\n  <li>Jasmine and Karma</li>\n  <li>NSubstitute, Moq or similar isolation framework</li>\n  <li>Bitbucket Pipelines, Bamboo, Jenkins, Azure Deployment, or similar CI/CD tools</li>\n  <li>Microservices technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)</li>\n </ul>\n <p>TO APPLY:<br> To apply, please upload your resume along with a cover letter detailing your interest and related experience to the position, and your compensation requirements. Ascendle requires the completion of a background check upon offer of employment.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://ascendle.bamboohr.com/jobs/' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Virtual company with a great culture</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible work schedules</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Competitive compensation</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Excellent benefits package</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Highly professional, top performing scrum teams</span> </li> \n</ul>",

We’re not going to be the next Uber, and we don’t want to be. We like being small and profitable with a great team. We believe in steady growth, quality service and producing an excellent product.</p>\n <p>We produce software that works with English-language documents. Our flagship software, PerfectIt, is an add-in for MS Word that finds mistakes that spelling and grammar checkers won’t find, such as consistency errors and style issues. The English language is a beast! And working to automate proofreading tasks for English is one of the most challenging and interesting aspects of our work.</p>\n <p>We’re at the forefront of proofreading/editing technologies. We were among the first companies to produce apps for Office and add-ons for Google Docs, and we have plans to do more development in these environments as the next generation of word processors takes off.</p>\n <p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Work from Home<br></strong></p>\n <p>Candidates should be based in the United Kingdom. Intelligent Editing has no offices, so candidates should be equipped to work from home.</p>\n <p><strong>Flexible Working</strong></p>\n <p>We have a team call every day between 3pm and 5pm (UK time). All other hours are flexible. If you produce great work, we don’t care when you do it.</p>\n <p><strong>A Life Beyond Programming</strong></p>\n <p>We believe that it’s impossible for developers to work more than forty hours per week and sustain quality. Our founder is a workaholic, but he doesn’t want others doing that! So we work forty hours per week, and we don’t usually do overtime.</p>\n <p>We’re sympathetic to the demands of parenting and welcome applications from experienced professionals who need the flexibility that life with children demands.</p>\n <p><strong>A Stake in Success</strong></p>\n <p>We offer equity in the business so you will own your success. Equity options will be negotiated at the end of the first year.</p>\n <p>Find out more about us at <a href='http://www.intelligentediting.com' rel='nofollow'>www.intelligentediting.com</a></p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Work from home</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Have an equity stake in a startup's success</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible hours</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Small team that listens to you</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>A life beyond programming</span> </li> \n</ul>",

We've got a job for you (and it's not dishwashing ;-) ). \n  <br> \n  <br>Do you put them in the sink and expect someone else to do them? Move on, please. \n  <br> \n  <br>Do you get pissed (in a professional way) when someone else leaves their dishes in the sink? &nbsp;Please apply! \n  <br> \n  <br>TrainerRoad is looking to expand our engineering group. We're looking for smart software engineers who &quot;get things done.&quot; We’re interested in remote candidates in the USA or candidates interested in working in our Reno office. \n  <br> \n  <br>Areas of work include ASP.NET MVC Backend, API, Workers, Micro Services, MS SQL Azure, Azure Queues/Tables, Azure Blob Storage, SignalR, and ASP.NET Core (on our roadmap), Azure monitoring and administration. \n  <br> \n  <br>We're looking to hire:&nbsp;1x Web Backend Developer \n  <br> \n  <br>Web Development \n  <br> \n  <br>You'd be joining other engineers who are focused on the backend of our website. \n  <br> \n  <br>The backend team is the&nbsp;hub between our apps (iOS/Android/PC/Mac), front-end website and data storage. We have a massive amount of data, and it's very likely that you might queue up tens of millions of items to be processed quickly and efficiently.&nbsp; \n  <br> \n  <br>You'll also manage integrations&nbsp;with external APIs. You'll need to do all of this while not breaking our current system. \n  <br> \n  <br>Cool Things we Do \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Every PR has a set of unit tests and&nbsp;automated UI tests&nbsp;run against it. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Every PR is code reviewed. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We have a dedicated QA team to manually check your PR (it requires four testers to sign off). \n  <br> \n  <br>* Every PR that is approved is automatically deployed&nbsp;(CI). \n  <br> \n  <br>* We've got a beta system that has a flow of production data that helps you develop and test your code without worry of breaking things. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Everything is hosted on Azure. There's plenty of dev/beta/test servers and databases to use. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The web team has its own Product Manager. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We run two-week sprints.&nbsp; The web team reviews, estimates, and discusses all sprint issues before they are free to be worked. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We often pair program. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The majority of our engineers are remote. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We have a front-end team that works in Angular 2+ and React (meaning you won't have to&nbsp;do UI work). \n  <br> \n  <br>* We have a skilled design team that handles the HTML/LESS for the website (again, no UI work for you). \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Who&nbsp;We're Looking For \n  <br> \n  <br>We want smart engineers who get shit done! Not only do you have to be smart, you have to be pragmatic. \n  <br> \n  <br>Let's say you need to paint a room white. \n  <br> \n  <br>Smart and Pragmatic Engineer: A pragmatic engineer fills up a sprayer (rather than use a paintbrush), gets to work, and makes sure they don't paint themselves into a corner. \n  <br> \n  <br>Smart Engineer (but not pragmatic): A smart engineer who's not pragmatic might design a system to change the color of the room in just 30 seconds.&nbsp; Sure, it would take 2 months to build the system but we could change colors so quickly!&nbsp; It's totally optimized for repainting! \n  <br> \n  <br>If the second example sounds like you, please do not apply.&nbsp; We know it's fun to go hog wild in projects but we need to &quot;get shit done&quot;.&nbsp; There's a whole line of other engineers and designers waiting for that room to get painted so they can do their own work on it. \n  <br> \n  <br>We're a Team, not a Family \n  <br> \n  <br>It sounds harsh to say, but we're not a Family. I know lots of businesses call themselves&nbsp;a family, but I think it's BS. If you get drunk at work and yell at someone, we're going to let you go (although we would give Grandma a pass at Thanksgiving). \n  <br> \n  <br>It's better to think of TrainerRoad like a sports team. Everyone has their role and their jobs.&nbsp; It's our jobs as managers to bring new hires up to speed, train them in our system, and coach them to be successful. \n  <br> \n  <br>If someone is not performing, we need to talk to them, coach them, find out what's going wrong and where we can improve.&nbsp; If someone just can't perform to the standard level of the team and we can't coach them to get better, we have to let that person go. \n  <br> \n  <br>Another clear sign that you have a high-performance team is that if everyone would &quot;enthusiastically rehire&quot; each other for their current roles.&nbsp; It really makes work wonderful when you respect, trust and value your co-workers. \n  <br> \n  <br>Required Technology Experience \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* C# Experience - Intermediate to Advanced&nbsp;proficiency \n  <br> \n  <br>* Cloud Experience - Azure or AWS \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Optional Technology Experience \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* ASP.net MVC \n  <br> \n  <br>* LINQ \n  <br> \n  <br>* Web API \n  <br> \n  <br>* Azure \n  <br> \n  <br>* SQL \n  <br> \n  <br>* Build/Test CI (We use TeamCity) \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Work Remote or in Reno, Nevada \n  <br> \n  <br>We're looking for the best candidate we can find in the US. Three-quarters of our development&nbsp;team work remotely. It works very well with the help of Slack and Github. \n  <br> \n  <br>We expect remote employees&nbsp;to overlap at least 6 hours with the Reno, Nevada office (we're there 8am-5pm Pacific time). \n  <br> \n  <br>Salary \n  <br> \n  <br>We're looking to hire engineers for&nbsp;110k/year. &nbsp;If you ask for more, we'll reject your application. If you're interested in the company please subscribe to our RSS feed at jobs.trainerroad.com for when a higher level job posting is open. \n  <br> \n  <br>Perks \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Unlimited Vacation \n  <br> \n  <br>* 401k with 4% company matching&nbsp; \n  <br> \n  <br>* 99% of employees individual health care paid (I know 99% is weird...it's an ACA thing, and it ends up being just a few dollars per paycheck) You can see&nbsp;a preview of what you'd pay here:&nbsp;https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27 \n  <br> \n  <br>* Flexible schedule \n  <br> \n  <br>* Access to the latest fitness devices (power meters, trainers, sensors, etc.) \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Your Resume should have: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Links to any open source projects you've contributed to (not required) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Github/StackOverflow username if you'd like \n  <br> \n  <br>* Examples of experience in the &quot;Optional Technology Experience&quot; area \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Your Cover Letter should have: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Let us know why you want to work for TrainerRoad \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>We also Require \n  <br> \n  <br>The best engineers only want to work with other great engineers. We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview. \n  <br> \n  <br>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable. \n  <br> \n  <br>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere. \n  <br> \n  <br>You can find the refactoring exercise with instructions here:&nbsp;https://github.com/trainerroad/BackendRefactorChallenge \n  <br> \n  <br>Excited about our Company? \n  <br> \n  <br>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company. \n  <br> \n  <br>FAQs \n  <br> \n  <br>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply? \n  <br> \n  <br>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user, let us know! \n  <br> \n  <br>What's unlimited vacation mean? \n  <br> \n  <br>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out. \n  <br> \n  <br>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time. \n  <br> \n  <br>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more, and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements, everything else works itself out. \n  <br> \n  <br>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem. \n  <br> \n  <br>How do you work? \n  <br> \n  <br>We're big believers in&nbsp;Deep Work&nbsp;and&nbsp;Flow. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand distraction-free for multiple hours totally.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward. \n  <br> \n  <br>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work. \n  <br> \n  <br>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests. \n  <br> \n  <br>We have partial test coverage, and we're constantly improving in that area. \n  <br> \n  <br>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each App release, and we're continually getting more automated. \n  <br> \n  <br>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster. \n  <br> \n  <br>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels. \n  <br> \n  <br>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up). \n  <br> \n  <br>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play. \n  <br> \n  <br>We often pair program via Slack. \n  <br> \n  <br>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github. \n  <br> \n  <br>Developers get super-fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive, we want to spend the money on it. \n  <br> \n  <br>You didn't ask about education, what's required? \n  <br> \n  <br>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught. \n  <br> \n  <br>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process? \n  <br> \n  <br>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp; \n  <br> \n  <br>If you did follow directions, our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code, and it should be reviewed that way without bias. \n  <br> \n  <br>If we like your refactoring, we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. Nothing super in-depth CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad. \n  <br> \n  <br>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview. \n  <br> \n  <br>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and an engineer. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us. \n  <br> \n  <br>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp; \n  <br> \n  <br>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through, but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard, you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;. \n  <br> \n  <br>What's with the dishes analogy? \n  <br> \n  <br>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud. \n  <br> \n  <br>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk. \n  <br> \n  <br>Want more detail about the benefits? \n  <br> \n  <br>You can see a preview of TrainerRoad's health benefits here:&nbsp;https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27 \n  <br> \n  <br>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end? \n  <br> \n  <br>Right now! Congrats if you made it this far! We look forward to looking at your resume and refactoring exercise. \n  <br> \n  <br>TrainerRoad is an equal opportunity employer. \n </div> \n</div>",
