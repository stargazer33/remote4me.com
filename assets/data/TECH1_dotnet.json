We believe in flexible work hours and a good work-life balance, and while we love to achieve great things via concentrated work, it’s incredibly important for us to have happy and engaged team members and to hire people who are great cultural contributors.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>ESOP</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working time</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Paid holidays</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Learning budget</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

    "content": "10flats is a search algorithm that seeks to disrupt the way people search for real estate. We all have rented apartments and know how frustrating and time-consuming it might be scrolling through hundreds of posts trying the find some real gems. The biggest problem is the listing portal itself. The way they monetize their business models involves tons of listings. The more posts there are, the more money they make. Easy. The problem, however, is that no user is interested in the endless scrolling of hundreds of places – (s)he is interested in finding THE place.<br /><br />This is where 10flats kicks in. A typical client normally visits about 10 properties before moving in. So what stops other listing portals from limiting search result to 10 at max? The answer is – their poor algorithms. The portals simply cannot capture the entire decision-making process, and thus they stick to what's simple and easy. They use the unit (apartment or house) as the key driver in search, i.e. size, bedrooms, bathrooms, furnished, home appliances, windows face south, etc. However, when a person moves in, (s)he surprisingly finds out that the nearest grocery store is 3 blocks away, the closest gym is 30 minutes bus distance, the only school in the neighborhood happens to be senior and not primary. These are the drivers of the ecosystem that create and support our lifestyle. They are never accounted for by search algorithms.<br /><br />10flats uses an extended search algorithm to find those missing bits of lifestyle. What is the benefit for the user? 10flat within 60 seconds can return 10 curated listings that match your living criteria 90% and more. No more times wasted scrolling, no more time wasted researching neighborhoods, no more visits to mismatched apartments. Stop scrolling, start living.<br /><br />10flats is looking for another team member, an enthusiasts web developer who would support the algorithm on the client side in our journey to disrupt the real estate search. This position is not salaried but with a substantial part of equity upon incorporation. Please also note that we are looking to start in DACH so the role better have a good command of German, besides English or Russian.",

We came into this money by selling a few new subscriptions to our SaaS application every month for over 16 years, with no investors or debt.   <br>   <br>Our business is growing fast and we need to hire an additional developer to help us keep pace.&nbsp; Today there are 11 people at our company, and more than 2000 customers who are paying us to help them run their businesses. We want to improve our products, build new products, and improve our internal infrastructure. But all of that is worthless if we’re not satisfied, happy, and have sane lives, too.   <br>   <br>Here’s why I love working at Moraware:   <br>   <br>   <br>* We care deeply about quality of life, not global domination.   <br>   <br>* I get to talk to smart people that are my friends every day.   <br>   <br>* I get to make changes that impact the success of our business, and the success of our customers’ businesses.   <br>   <br>* We all have flexibility in terms of schedule, and what we’re working on.   <br>   <br>* I get to work on a variety of projects that keep me interested in the work.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Everyone in the company works remotely from home. Communication and collaboration are critical for us. We’re on Skype with each other multiple times a day, to check in on progress, design a new feature, collaborate on how to structure some code, or to tell a funny story about what happened last night.&nbsp; We also get together multiple times throughout the year to spend time collaborating together in person.   <br>   <br>We're adding another member to our Development and Operations team.&nbsp; Our Development and Operations team members spend part of their time working on building software and part of their time ensuring that our servers are running smoothly.   <br>   <br>Some of the projects we are working on:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Adding new features to make our customers businesses run more efficiently   <br>   <br>* Creating new tools and improving existing tools to make life easier for our Support and Sales teams   <br>   <br>* Configuring new Windows servers occasionally   <br>   <br>* Installing Windows updates every month   <br>   <br>* Monitoring the servers for errors   <br>   <br>* Writing new stored procedures, or optimizing existing queries for SQL Server 2017   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Our technology stack is C#, JavaScript, SQL Server, HTML5   <br>   <br>As a stable and profitable company, we offer all the expected salary, benefits, and vacation of any great employer.   <br>   <br>If you love the things we love, and you are interested in the projects we’re working on, here’s what you should do. DO NOT send us a resume. I’m sure your resume is terrible, because they all are. Send an email to   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span> containing:   <br>   <br>* 3-10 sentences describing why you are proud of one project you have worked on   <br>   <br>* 3-10 sentences about why you are qualified to work on some of the projects we listed above   <br>   <br>* which of these 5 states you are living in: California, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Moraware is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.   <br>   <br>Candidates must be&nbsp;authorized to work in the U.S.&nbsp; We are unable to sponsor H1-B Visa’s at this time.  </div> </div>",

How about leading the effort to renovate a crusty Enterprise (capital “E”) industry with modern web development tools and tactics?   <br>   <br>Our Product Engineering team is led by developers with extensive backgrounds in modern workflows and toolchains. Our goal is to deliver contemporary web applications to an industry mired in late 90’s technology. We need top-tier developers who are excited about writing code that solves new problems with an inclination for leadership: trailblazers attracted to green-field opportunities, who can self-direct with minimal oversight, and thrive when there’s a personal stake in their work and the outcome.   <br>   <br>Company headquarters are located in Fort Lauderdale, FL, and we’d prefer someone onsite. That said, a growing portion of our team works remotely, so you’ll interact with tools such as Zoom, Skype, HipChat, etc.   <br>   <br>This position is responsible for serving as the technical lead for day to day software development activities in coordination with Software Engineers, as well as coordinating both tactical and strategic technical changes with the Product Manager and Client Services. This is a “hands on” role meaning responsibilities also include daily execution (delivering features and resolving issues). This position also entails troubleshooting, diagnosis, and remediation for issues identified in production. The ideal candidate meshes well with software engineers, IT teams, and business stakeholders to help shepherd healthy change and growth of the product platform and codebase.   <br>   <br>Required   <br>   <br>   <br>* Solid programming skills in&nbsp;C#, T-SQL, and Javascript   <br>   <br>* Knowledge of modern HTML, CSS and JavaScript   <br>   <br>* Proven track record of getting stuff done   <br>   <br>* Excellent telecommuting skills: self-motivating, self-directing, and a good communicator   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Preferred   <br>   <br>   <br>* Experience with React.js   <br>   <br>* Experience in system, network, or database administration   <br>   <br>* Background in healthcare, particularly Medicare/Medicaid compliance   <br>   <br>* Background in freelance or startups. Recovering entrepreneurs should definitely apply!   <br>   <br>* Fluency in more than one server-side language   <br>   <br>* Active profiles on Stack Overflow and/or GitHub, personal blogs, and the like   <br>   <br>* Open source code or example projects that you're proud of   <br>   <br>* Any other evidence of your passion for building great software   <br>   <br>   <br>  </div> </div>",
