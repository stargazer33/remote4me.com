Whether we’re helping developers get answers to their questions or find new jobs, we build products that make millions of developers’ lives better every day. Our goal is to create a community and a company where every developer feels welcome to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers.</p><p>Stack Overflow for Enterprise gives organizations a private, secure home for their team’s questions and answers, as well as a robust set of tools to manage their community. As a full-stack web developer on the Enterprise team, you’ll join a cross-disciplinary team of developers, designers, and product managers working on new and existing features and bugs.</p><p><strong>Recent and upcoming projects include:</strong></p><ul><li>Creating a Single Sign-On framework to make authentication as easy as possible for customers.</li><li>Improving our search algorithms to help developers find the answers they need across both public and private Stack Overflow Q&amp;A.</li><li>Designing and implementing V2 of Enterprise instance monitoring to ensure that our customers are having an excellent and bug-free experience. The challenge is in reporting general metrics (like exception counts, questions asked and answered counts, etc.) without accessing or transmitting any private or secure customer data or PII.</li><li>You’ll work primarily in our main tech stack of C#, ASP.NET, and Microsoft SQL Server, with supporting technologies like Redis, TypeScript, and Elasticsearch.</li><li>The Enterprise team also makes use of Azure and other containerization technologies.</li><li>If you’re not familiar with our specific tech stack, we’ll pair you with mentors who will help you bridge the gaps.</li><li>We do expect to see some existing enterprise-level experience in the successful candidate for this role.</li></ul><p><strong>We’re a remote-first team. Whether you work remotely or work out of our New York office, you’ll be part of a remote work culture that emphasizes online communication (Trello, Slack, GitHub, Hangouts, Zoom, Stack Overflow for Teams).</strong> <strong>While we’re generally very flexible on working hours, for this position you’ll need to have a wide coverage of our customers from Europe to West Coast US. As a result you’ll be expected to work roughly New York time zone hours.</strong></p><p><strong>This role also requires occasional flexibility in working hours</strong>. Many of our customers expect software deployments, upgrades, and hotfixes to be installed during off-business hours (such as early mornings or late evenings). In addition, some debugging with customers will occasionally be required, at the convenience of their working hours. These tasks are fairly infrequent (We tend to deploy 3 major releases per year, with a few hotfixes as-needed). We also believe in strong work-life balance and provide comp time during regular working hours for each extra hour worked. The successful candidate should be aware of these expectations and be comfortable with occasionally flexible working hours (and the ensuing flexible time off in lieu). Emergencies and “on call” events are very rare – you should not expect work to intrude on your weekends.</p><p><strong>Skills and Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>We expect to see:</strong></p><ul><li>Solid programming skills in your language of choice (not necessarily ours) and a track record of getting stuff done.</li><li>5+ years full-stack web dev experience with any major server-side stack, relational database, and modern front-end (JS, HTML, CSS). Experience in our stack is a plus, but not a requirement.</li><li>Prior enterprise-level development and lifecycle experience. You’ve worked on a large enterprise-class product before.</li><li>Self-motivating, self-directing and a great communicator.</li></ul><p><strong>We like to see (but not required):</strong></p><ul><li>Experience working remotely and/or working with teams that are distributed geographically.</li><li>Experience shipping features in a fast-moving, cross-disciplinary team (Product Managers, Designers, UX Researchers, Product Marketing, etc).</li><li>An active Stack Overflow profile, open source code, example projects that you’re proud of (whether open source or worked on at a previous job), or any other evidence of your passion for building great software.</li><li>Knowledge of how Stack Overflow works from our blog and podcasts.</li><li>Experience with Stack Overflow for Teams or Stack Overflow for Enterprise.</li></ul><p><strong>When you apply… </strong>Please include an up-to-date resume. We also strongly encourage you to include a cover letter explaining why you’re interested in working at Stack Overflow.</p><p><strong>What you’ll get in return:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Flexible hours</strong></li><li>20 days paid vacation + holidays</li><li>Completely free health insurance – no copay, no premiums (US residents)</li><li>Generous parental leave (12-16 weeks at 100% pay), family care leave, and unlimited sick days</li><li>Employees will never be poked with a sharp stick</li></ul><p><strong>If you want to work remotely…. We’ll help you set up a great home office, with an ergonomic chair, standing desk, and any other equipment you need to do your job.</strong></p><p><strong>If you want to work in our office… </strong>You’ll get your own private office in our headquarters in New York City, and enjoy additional benefits like free lunch every day prepared by our own in-house chefs, transportation reimbursement, and all the espresso you can drink.</p><p><strong>About Stack Overflow</strong></p><p>Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. More than 50 million professional and aspiring programmers visit Stack Overflow each month to help solve coding problems, develop new skills, and find job opportunities.</p><p>We partner with businesses to help them understand, hire, engage, and enable the world’s developers. Our products and services are focused on developer marketing, technical recruiting, market research, and enterprise knowledge sharing.</p><p>We believe in hiring smart people and getting out of their way. We have an office in New York with some of the best amenities of any New York startup, and we have people who work remotely all over the world. We keep meetings and ceremony to an absolute minimum.</p><p><strong>What we value:</strong></p><ul><li>Servant Leadership: We lead by empowering and inspiring people to do their best work, not by micromanaging. We hire smart people, set them up for success, then get out of their way.</li><li>Collaboration: The best products are created when people from different backgrounds and disciplines work closely together in an environment of respect and trust.</li><li>Transparency: Trust is built on openness and transparency. If there is not a good reason to keep it a secret, we share it. For example, we share our complete engineering salary formula.</li><li>Inclusion: We do our best work when we can be our whole selves at work. We’re committed to policies and benefits that support people, and leaders who foster an open and inclusive culture.</li></ul><p><strong>Diverse teams build better products.</strong></p><p><em>Legally, we need you to know this:</em></p><p>Stack Exchange, Inc. does not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class. We support workplace diversity. Employment is conditioned upon successful completion of a background check and upon having the appropriate legal right to work.</p><p><em>But we want to add this:</em></p><p>We strongly believe that diversity contributes to a broader collective perspective that will consistently lead to a better company and better products. We are working hard to increase the diversity of our team wherever we can and we actively encourage everyone to consider becoming a part of it.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/company/work-here/1715858/senior-full-stack-web-developer-enterprise' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

As we're pre-revenue the budget is limited. <br /><br />But the beta is ready and the business plan is written. And you’ll be working with a founder who has raised an A-round of £300k for an earlier project.<br /><br />The role will initially be part-time or on a contract basis. We're raising a round, we'll make you full time and pay you a full-time salary when we do. <br /><br />As a key partner, you'll get a generous share option package from the start to reflect your time and commitment in the fundraising. We’ll get you a top of the range Mac (you’ll need it for iOS development). <br /><br />Where you’ll work<br /><br />Although we’re based in Birmingham and will need to see you in person from time to time, you can work remotely the rest of the time.<br />",

    "content": "10flats is a search algorithm that seeks to disrupt the way people search for real estate. We all have rented apartments and know how frustrating and time-consuming it might be scrolling through hundreds of posts trying the find some real gems. The biggest problem is the listing portal itself. The way they monetize their business models involves tons of listings. The more posts there are, the more money they make. Easy. The problem, however, is that no user is interested in the endless scrolling of hundreds of places – (s)he is interested in finding THE place.<br /><br />This is where 10flats kicks in. A typical client normally visits about 10 properties before moving in. So what stops other listing portals from limiting search result to 10 at max? The answer is – their poor algorithms. The portals simply cannot capture the entire decision-making process, and thus they stick to what's simple and easy. They use the unit (apartment or house) as the key driver in search, i.e. size, bedrooms, bathrooms, furnished, home appliances, windows face south, etc. However, when a person moves in, (s)he surprisingly finds out that the nearest grocery store is 3 blocks away, the closest gym is 30 minutes bus distance, the only school in the neighborhood happens to be senior and not primary.

We came into this money by selling a few new subscriptions to our SaaS application every month for over 16 years, with no investors or debt.   <br>   <br>Our business is growing fast and we need to hire an additional developer to help us keep pace.&nbsp; Today there are 11 people at our company, and more than 2000 customers who are paying us to help them run their businesses. We want to improve our products, build new products, and improve our internal infrastructure. But all of that is worthless if we’re not satisfied, happy, and have sane lives, too.   <br>   <br>Here’s why I love working at Moraware:   <br>   <br>   <br>* We care deeply about quality of life, not global domination.   <br>   <br>* I get to talk to smart people that are my friends every day.   <br>   <br>* I get to make changes that impact the success of our business, and the success of our customers’ businesses.   <br>   <br>* We all have flexibility in terms of schedule, and what we’re working on.   <br>   <br>* I get to work on a variety of projects that keep me interested in the work.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Everyone in the company works remotely from home. Communication and collaboration are critical for us. We’re on Skype with each other multiple times a day, to check in on progress, design a new feature, collaborate on how to structure some code, or to tell a funny story about what happened last night.&nbsp; We also get together multiple times throughout the year to spend time collaborating together in person.   <br>   <br>We're adding another member to our Development and Operations team.&nbsp; Our Development and Operations team members spend part of their time working on building software and part of their time ensuring that our servers are running smoothly.   <br>   <br>Some of the projects we are working on:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Adding new features to make our customers businesses run more efficiently   <br>   <br>* Creating new tools and improving existing tools to make life easier for our Support and Sales teams   <br>   <br>* Configuring new Windows servers occasionally   <br>   <br>* Installing Windows updates every month   <br>   <br>* Monitoring the servers for errors   <br>   <br>* Writing new stored procedures, or optimizing existing queries for SQL Server 2017   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Our technology stack is C#, JavaScript, SQL Server, HTML5   <br>   <br>As a stable and profitable company, we offer all the expected salary, benefits, and vacation of any great employer.   <br>   <br>If you love the things we love, and you are interested in the projects we’re working on, here’s what you should do. DO NOT send us a resume. I’m sure your resume is terrible, because they all are. Send an email to   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span> containing:   <br>   <br>* 3-10 sentences describing why you are proud of one project you have worked on   <br>   <br>* 3-10 sentences about why you are qualified to work on some of the projects we listed above   <br>   <br>* which of these 5 states you are living in: California, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Moraware is committed to creating a diverse environment and is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, genetics, disability, age, or veteran status.   <br>   <br>Candidates must be&nbsp;authorized to work in the U.S.&nbsp; We are unable to sponsor H1-B Visa’s at this time.  </div> </div>",

How about leading the effort to renovate a crusty Enterprise (capital “E”) industry with modern web development tools and tactics?   <br>   <br>Our Product Engineering team is led by developers with extensive backgrounds in modern workflows and toolchains. Our goal is to deliver contemporary web applications to an industry mired in late 90’s technology. We need top-tier developers who are excited about writing code that solves new problems with an inclination for leadership: trailblazers attracted to green-field opportunities, who can self-direct with minimal oversight, and thrive when there’s a personal stake in their work and the outcome.   <br>   <br>Company headquarters are located in Fort Lauderdale, FL, and we’d prefer someone onsite. That said, a growing portion of our team works remotely, so you’ll interact with tools such as Zoom, Skype, HipChat, etc.   <br>   <br>This position is responsible for serving as the technical lead for day to day software development activities in coordination with Software Engineers, as well as coordinating both tactical and strategic technical changes with the Product Manager and Client Services. This is a “hands on” role meaning responsibilities also include daily execution (delivering features and resolving issues). This position also entails troubleshooting, diagnosis, and remediation for issues identified in production. The ideal candidate meshes well with software engineers, IT teams, and business stakeholders to help shepherd healthy change and growth of the product platform and codebase.   <br>   <br>Required   <br>   <br>   <br>* Solid programming skills in&nbsp;C#, T-SQL, and Javascript   <br>   <br>* Knowledge of modern HTML, CSS and JavaScript   <br>   <br>* Proven track record of getting stuff done   <br>   <br>* Excellent telecommuting skills: self-motivating, self-directing, and a good communicator   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Preferred   <br>   <br>   <br>* Experience with React.js   <br>   <br>* Experience in system, network, or database administration   <br>   <br>* Background in healthcare, particularly Medicare/Medicaid compliance   <br>   <br>* Background in freelance or startups. Recovering entrepreneurs should definitely apply!   <br>   <br>* Fluency in more than one server-side language   <br>   <br>* Active profiles on Stack Overflow and/or GitHub, personal blogs, and the like   <br>   <br>* Open source code or example projects that you're proud of   <br>   <br>* Any other evidence of your passion for building great software   <br>   <br>   <br>  </div> </div>",
