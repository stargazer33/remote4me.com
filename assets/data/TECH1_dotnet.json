Our companies are taking mandated professional education to the next level as we produce tools, courses, and job aides that help customers achieve more in their days and their careers.  We help professionals become licensed, stay licensed and gain the skills to perform at the top of their fields.</p><p>Essential Skillset: TypeScript, Angular 6+, Unit Testing (Jasmine/Karma), Experience consuming APIs. GitNice to have: Knowledge of relational databases and SQL .NET / C#</p><p>What You’ll Do: As a Software Engineer, you’ll play a key role in building and testing new features and frameworks for supporting an ecosystem of common web applications used by many subsidiaries within the Colibri Group family of companies. You’ll work as a member of the technology team to collaborate with UX, product management, QA and other software engineers to define new features, estimate and implement them. Your main duties will start within the TypeScript/Angular framework, which will be consuming a .NET API, which you will have the opportunity to work on as well. In addition to creating tests with Jasmine/Karma and completing peer reviewed pull request into our production environment.</p><p>Responsibilities: We practice continuous delivery and work in an agile environment. You'll design and implement critical elements of architecture and application components for common offerings. The ideal applicant pays close attention to detail, is inquisitive, able to be self-directed while open to collaboration. We follow an unapologetic “no ego” release process where fellow engineers input opinions and suggestions on the code you would like to release to production, thereby attempting to ensure the highest quality code is released. You’ll be working on a team that owns the code from development through release into production, for multiple applications, deploying a DevOps model of complete ownership.</p><p>A bit more about the position: The position will involve support of several of our web applications. Foremost among these would be the customer dashboard. Our dashboard is setup to serve our different subsidiary companies with the same set of code. It is angular, with a dash of ionic (which we have been slowly moving away from while staying committed to angular.) The dashboard is actively developed with 11,000 commits over the last two years. As a developer on the membership/mobile team we are concentrating on improving our customers membership experience by adding and improving features to the dashboard. Other applications you will have the opportunity to interact with are a c#.net api application, a .net student course runner application as well as older .net internal applications.</p><p>We run in an agile pattern with two week sprints, story point estimating, daily zoom standups, and sprint retrospectives. Our sprint planning meetings typical have developers discussing what the highest priority is with direction from the product owner and divvying up the sprint work as the developers see fit. The position is 100% remote, with the occasional in person all engineering meetings which occur for a few days every year or two. We have typically had new developers on the team spend a sprint working on improving test coverage as it allows them to get into the code and understand the code base.</p><p>Interested in this job?

    "content": "<h3> Senior Python Backend Developer </h3><div><div><br>Who we are<br><br></div><div>We are Worthy - and so are you! We want to democratize capital by making money more accessible for those who need to borrow it and by making investments with strong returns available to those who would like a better financial future.<br><br></div><div>We want to help people grow a nest egg even if they think they can’t… and to do it while supporting Main Street, not Wall Street!<br><br></div><div>Our first product is a free micro-investment app that helps you save &amp; grow your money – a dollar at a time. It monitors your everyday spending and rounds up each transaction to a whole dollar. It then automatically invests every $10 into a 5% interest earning Worthy Bond, which in turn supports small creditworthy businesses across the U.S., helping to strengthen our local communities.<br><br></div><div>We are a remote-first company with offices in sunny Boca Raton, Florida. We avoid the noise of Slack, but we use Twist, Keybase and Confluence to keep in sync. We're on Gitlab to take advantage of their integrated CI/CD pipeline (we love continuous stuff!) and issue tracker.<br><br></div><div><br>Who you are<br><br></div><div>You’re an experienced backend web developer who has worked for 5+ years on a few production web apps and APIs at scale. Experience working on financial or accounting applications preferred.<br><br></div><div>You use Python on a daily basis for various tasks, from APIs to scheduled tasks and maintenance scripts.<br><br></div><div>You can design and implement an API and future-proof it. You have a strong opinion on whether APIs should be versioned in the URI or in a response header, and can defend that opinion. You know how to upgrade an API while keeping it backwards-compatible for older clients.<br><br></div><div>You’re aware of which data fits best in a relational database and which in a document-oriented one. You can use a framework-provided ORM, but can also jump in and fine-tune SQL queries when needed. You know enough database management to create and maintain an efficient schema in PostgreSQL, indexes and all.<br><br></div><div>You’re experienced enough to avoid most bugs and programming errors, but you use tools such as linters and write unit &amp; integration tests to catch all the others.<br><br></div><div>You can secure both internal and public-facing APIs using different methods, including one-time passwords (TOTP) for two-factor authentication. You consider security and privacy when designing any new features or reviewing existing code.<br><br></div><div>Most importantly, you can communicate clearly and efficiently in writing, as well as in online video/audio calls. You can handle the async (over)communication requirements of a remote-first environment and can manage your own time and productivity.<br><br></div><div>For everyone’s sake, you develop on either OS X or a Linux flavor. We don’t do windows.<br><br></div><div>You are eligible to legally work in the U.S. as a full-time employee. Given the role's responsibilities, this is a hard requirement, even though we will have other positions where we can hire more liberally. Note that this doesn't require actual presence in the U.S. (expats welcome!).<br><br></div><div><br>What you’ll do<br><br></div><div>We’ve build a solid, stable serverless API using Zappa on AWS Lambda. Our infrastructure is mostly managed via Terraform and our deployments are one-click, thanks to Gitlab’s CI/CD pipelines. While we rely on third parties for some key features, we’ve never had any downtime caused by anything we wrote.<br><br></div><div>Concretely, you’ll help build new business features as we grow our offerings. You will help us trim our backlog and keep technical debt in check. Since we already have robust test coverage, you will help maintain that by writing unit and integration tests for all new features and any bugs fixed.<br><br></div><div>You will also perform light devOps duties via Terraform and (rarely) manually, such as Gitlab instance upgrades or bastion security checks and updates. You’ll participate in planning &amp; prioritization meetings to help estimate complexity and think of creative solutions to business and growth problems.<br><br></div><div>You are required to have at least basic experience with our existing stack, but more importantly, you need to have the ability and desire to learn and adapt.<br><br></div><div><br>What you’ll get<br><br></div><ul><li>you can work remote from anywhere in the U.S. or from our office in Boca Raton, FL</li><li>you’ll set your own work schedule, as long as you can deliver and be productive (we prefer two 3-hour focused, uninterrupted work sessions, with morning, lunch and evening communication breaks to stay in sync)</li><li>competitive salary for a remote position</li><li>health insurance &amp; stock options</li><li>more benefits as we continue growing</li></ul><div><br>How to apply<br><br></div><div>We don’t do resumes. They only prove who signed your previous paychecks.<br><br></div><div>Send us your Git(hub/lab/bucket) profile, places where we can &quot;see&quot; your backend code in production, along with a short email explaining what kinds of problems you solved in the past, and how you did it.<br><br></div><div>In essence, please convince us we’re a good fit for each other with any arguments you’d like.<br><br></div><div>We’ll contact you by phone or email for a quick chat, then we’ll set up a video call with the CEO and CTO.<br><br></div><div>There will be no gimmicky interview quizzes or whiteboard tests. Instead, we’ll ask you to show us some code, either from a previous job or, if NDAs prevent that, we’ll write some together. This is not to test you under pressure, but to filter out the inevitable applicants who are trying to fake it till they make it.<br><br></div><div>We’ll ask you to try out something new and talk us through it, whether it’s a new framework, concept (GraphQL instead of REST?) or an AWS service neither of us used before. We do this to see if you’re willing and able to learn new things and how you handle bumping into small obstacles on the way to delivering something that works, however trivial.<br><br></div><div><br></div></div>",

Do you have a stackoverflow profile? A hacker news profile? Do you tweet? Write about technical things on Medium? Contribute to open source in any way?</p><br /><p>- At least 3 years of professional experience</p><br /><p>- Live somewhere in the UK and can make it to Birmingham occasionally.</p><br /><p>- Have lots of ideas and a willingness to share them!</p><br /><p>- We&rsquo;re a startup so things can be chaotic. As well as being able to write good, clean code you&rsquo;ll need to be able to solve problems on a daily basis using your own initiative. Flexibility and resilience are key! If you&rsquo;re smart, friendly and love building software&mdash;we want to hear from you.</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>We&rsquo;ve boot-strapped the beta version with the help of contractors &ndash; so we&rsquo;re in the scrappy early stages. As we're pre-revenue the budget is limited. But the beta is ready and the business plan is written. And you&rsquo;ll be working with a founder who has raised an A-round of &pound;300k for an earlier project. The role will initially be part-time or on a contract basis. We're raising a round, we'll make you full time and pay you a full-time salary when we do.</p><br /><p>As a key partner, you'll get a generous share option package from the start to reflect your time and commitment in the fundraising.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Where you&rsquo;ll work </strong></p><br /><p>Although we&rsquo;re based in Birmingham and will need to see you in person from time to time, you can work remotely the rest of the time.</p>",

The process of quickly creating small changes, collecting feedback and then improving them incrementally is critical to providing the best possible solution for our customers.&nbsp;</p><p>2 ) We believe in **<strong>a balance between professional and personal lives**</strong>. We work with focus and energy during the day and then we go home to attend to our health, family and personal lives. During a crisis, it may be necessary for everybody to be involved for as long as it takes, but these circumstances should be rare.</p><p>3 ) We believe **<strong>learning</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and growth are vital**</strong>. Career development, coaching and training are not optional or secondary. They are necessary for our growth as individuals and our growth as a company.</p><p>4 ) We believe in **<strong>team ownership**</strong>. We commit to goals as a team and it is the team's responsibility to ensure the job is done. We do not say, &quot;It's not my job&quot;. We support each other and hold each other accountable to achieve our goals.</p><p>5 ) We believe in **<strong>doing what's best for our customers**</strong>. We listen to, guide and do our utmost to satisfy our customers both internal and external. Sometimes that means diverging from what a customer is explicitly asking for and guiding them towards the solution that is in their best interest.</p><p>6 ) We believe in a **<strong>bias towards action**</strong>. A good solution today is better than a perfect solution tomorrow.</p><p>7 ) We believe in **<strong>extensive automation**</strong>&nbsp;of routine tasks. Our single biggest cost is our salaries. We hire intelligent, talented people and we need them to work on activities that require their skills. Routine activities are relentlessly automated.</p><p>8 ) We believe in **<strong>consistency where it matters and autonomy where it doesn't**</strong>. It is important for teams to make decisions that are specific and pertinent to their success. Where it is necessary, we will agree on department wide standards. Where it doesn't matter, we believe the team is best suited to make that decision for themselves.</p><p>9 ) We believe in **<strong>making decisions based on a variety of perspectives**</strong>. Decisions made by a single individual are risky and are necessarily skewed by that person's perspective. A wide range of perspectives, personalities and backgrounds helps to produce better decisions. This does not mean we are a democracy. We believe that it is sometimes best for a leader to gather input from a qualified group of people and make an informed decision.</p><p>10 ) We believe in using the **<strong>simplest solution that effectively solves the problem**</strong>. Complexity that adds no value is both expensive to build and costly to maintain.&nbsp;</p><p>11 ) We believe that we must be **<strong>good stewards of the company's assets**</strong>. We all share responsibility in making sure we are using NAVEX's money and property effectively. Making good budgetary decisions is everybody's responsibility.</p><p>12 ) We believe that we must **<strong>operate by the highest ethical standards**</strong>. We are an ethics and compliance company. We as an organization and as individuals must hold each other accountable to behaving in a way that is in keeping with NAVEX's and our customers' high expectations for ethical behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>13 ) We believe in using the **<strong>best tool for the job**</strong>. Often that means adopting the latest technology. Sometimes that means passing up a cutting edge new technology because it's not appropriate for our business needs or is not yet ready for use in production applications.</p><p>14) We believe that **<strong>software is never done</strong>**. Software is a constantly evolving work. Software is not done until the last customer is removed from the system and the last server turned off.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Generous Time Off Policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Work Options 2x Per Week</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health, Vision &amp; Dental Insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Custom Laptops</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dedicated Time To Pursue New Technologies, Ideas &amp; Skill Development</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401(k) With Percentage Company Match</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Access To Pluralsight</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Fun, Collaborative, Friendly &amp; Positive Culture</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly Team Lunches</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\\n\\nWe take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.\\n\\nOlo is revolutionizing the customer experience with restaurant chains, and we're looking for talented engineers to join our team and help achieve this vision.

    "content": "<div>Syncro is a small team crafting applications helping small business be more successful. Our software has a primary component that is a &quot;remote machine management&quot; tool. For us, this means a user can install our management tool and in bulk do things like keep software up to date, enforce patch policies, perform remote desktop support, etc. We are open to taking risks with technology, we invented a new remote desktop tool that has a plan html5/javascript remote desktop client that runs in all browsers! We're building a company that has fun inventing. We go fast, and our customers love us. Thousands of repair shops and IT Professionals all over the world rely on our platform for their entire business operations. In fact this role can frequently start a feature and ship it to production the same day! We are different - we really do care, the founders are writing this ad and looking at the resumes - not a recruiter or HR department. We are using azure and teamcity, lots of dotnet. The client uses typescript, webRTC, and websockets. We need help building this Windows &quot;management agent.&quot; This is a small team (a couple people) in part of our tight knit development org. You'll know everyone by name, chat a lot in Slack, and have the freedom to pick the technology we use. If this sounds like the kind of team you want to be part of, we want to hear from you. Do you play around with new stuff for fun?Have any cool side projects to test out a new technology?Do you hear about a problem and just obsessed building a web app to solve it?If this sounds like your kind of play - we might be a great fit. :) HIGHLIGHTS: -Salaried position designed to grow with the company (seriously, try us).-We want this to be your dream job - but we need your help (tell us how).-We will advance your career like nobody else -- stay with us for the long haul and we'll keep you challenged, learning, passionate, and growing.-Results-oriented: Keep having fun and shipping code and you can design your day.-We are currently a dispersed team working from home and a few regional offices (Seattle, Bellevue, Bay Area, Orange County). (WeWork - super cool space ) WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING: -Lots of building and inventing.-Helping discover and flesh out new product ideas. (Roadmap has like 100 new features we're anxious to get to!)-Keeping us up to date with what you are learning in your spare time.-Bringing in new technology you discover that might solve a problem.-Coming up with improvements to many areas that are still sort of minimum viable state. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR: -A few years of building applications, designing interfaces, etc.-Intermediate/Expert in Windows (CSharp/Windows APIs) and .NET -Experience in TeamCity -Lots of experience with the Windows OS - things like Services, system tray, IPC, Networking, long run processes, WCF, WPF, WinForms, etc.-No specific education necessary. (really)-You're always learning and teach yourself. (Watch conference talks? Go to dev meetups?)-...So you must be a self-driven, self-learner (autodidacts ftw). -Excellent communication skills - verbal, written and electronic.-You care -- which means sometimes putting yourself out there for a customer experiencing pain.-Ability to multi-task in a fast paced environment.-You're kind and wily (in a good way). HOW TO GET HIRED BY US: Write us about a recent time or two that you caused a production outage, what the root cause was, and what you learned from it. For example; Troy our Founder shipped a typo in a class name a bit ago and those are annoying because they might be easily missed in Development environment but then production blows up. This led to a more robust CI+Staging step than we had prior. (web side) Just demonstrate that you are an individual, you have a personality, you enjoy life, and you enjoy good work. And please include a resume. :) SyncroMSP is an equal opportunity employer. Pay: DOE. Let's Talk.</div>",

We unify collaboration technologies like voice, video, and messaging on a single cloud-based platform so users can experience greater efficiency and less hassle each workday. The company is growing rapidly as we move full steam ahead toward our anticipated IPO. Now’s the time to bring your passion and expertise to our Fuze team!</p><p>Our customers use our software across a variety of platforms including Windows, OS X, iOS, Android and web. We build our software to work and provide a great experience across all of these platforms. Whenever possible we use open source technologies like WebRTC or OPAL. Where it makes sense we build our own software stacks. The Real Time Communications team also builds linux-based microservices that provide audio, video, screen share, content, recording and interoperability gateway functions. These microservices use a combination of REST APIs and IETF standards based protocols to provide functionality to our desktop, mobile and web-based clients. These microservices are built with scalability, resiliency and performance in mind.</p><p>The primary task of the Real Time Communications team is to build the heart of our product — the software stacks that power the audio and video communications within our product. This team works across both the client and backend stacks. Within this team you will get exposure to a broad range of technologies and challenges.</p><p>As much as possible we develop cross platform code — sharing code across clients and sometimes between the clients and various backend services. We believe strongly in modularity and code reuse. As we’re developing cross platform code that is often times CPU intensive and performance critical we tend to use C++ as our language of choice for code that requires portability between the clients and servers.</p><p>In this position you will be responsible for owning, developing and maintaining key components in our client media framework or the backend media services. You will develop services that are deployed globally and run in mixed environments including our own datacenters and AWS. You will be responsible for making key technical recommendations and then executing on your recommendations.You will be responsible for coming up with and implementing innovative solution to difficult problems. You must be hands on and have a passion for developing software.</p><p><strong>What You Will Need:</strong></p><ul><li>Expert C++ coding skills with minimum of 7 years experience</li><li>Experience with streaming media protocols (SIP, SDP, H.323)</li><li>Experience developing real-time audio/video communication systems leveraging RTP/RTCP and audio codecs such as Opus, G.711, G.722</li><li>Experience developing networking software including working with socket level programming and UDP/TCP</li><li>Experience developing and shipping high quality applications for OS X, Windows, iOS or Android is an asset</li><li>Experience building production Linux based services is an asset</li><li>Experience with WebRTC</li><li>Experience with Go and/or Python is a plus</li><li>Understanding of the various trade offs when dealing with real-time media</li><li>Drive, passion, dedication and a good attitude</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.fuze.com/careers#!/job/1713684' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We're building a digital assistant that takes care of the financial paperwork for entrepreneurs, saving them time, money and a lot of frustration and worries.</p><p>In the past months we&nbsp;worked hard on the business case, the design, finding funds and building a prototype (in Vue.js). Now it's time to bring her to life! And therefore we need you: a talented full stack developer that wants to join us on our journey.</p><p>As we are building our product from scratch, you have the unique opportunity to be part of the team, right from the very first lines of code. We offer you a&nbsp;playground where you can put all your passion in building a piece of software to be proud of. Software that is scalable and maintainable and can easily grow along with our customer base and the size of our team. Software that is secure and protects the data of our clients.</p><p>We expect you to be our technical guru. The go-to person that follows the latest trends in web and mobile development, juggles with .NET, Azure, React (Native), Apollo and GraphQL. The one that leads the way and coaches his fellow developers but learns from them at the same time. We’re too small for “overhead”, so we’re not looking for a manager but rather a passionate developer with strong analytical, engineering and people skills.</p><p><strong>Your job</strong></p><ul><li>You’re responsible for the software architecture and the quality of our code</li><li>You “lead by example” as one of the most driven and structured developers of the team</li><li>You coach your fellow developers when needed</li><li>You introduce best practices for coding and conduct regular code reviews.</li><li>You believe in our product and take up and active role in shaping its roadmap</li><li>You defined the test strategy &amp; make sure quality is monitored with automated tests&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Required Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Designing &amp; developing back-ends in the Microsoft technology stack ( C#, .NET, .NET Core, .NET, SQL Server)</li><li>Web/native app development with ASP.NET Core, React/Apollo &amp; HTML5/CSS</li><li>Api development with GraphQL</li><li>Designing&nbsp;scalable and secure&nbsp;architectures in Azure</li><li>Notions of mobile app development with Object C/Swift and&nbsp;Java/Kotlin</li><li>Strong communication skills</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/290221?reset=False&amp;ra=1zkwPIbSfLpK&amp;oqs=a%3D1zkwPIbSfLpK' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>a true “start-up” experience</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>a small team, lots of hard work, fun and impact</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>ownership &amp; responsibility to build with us the product we dream of</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

This individual/position is dedicated to the road usage charging business unit. This is a startup and this role will get to shape the technology that is used for the products that get developed. This role will work very close to the operations director, the business unit leader and the engineering team. That paragraph above is general blather and doesn’t really say a lot, so, here is the deal/role in a nutshell What we are doing? -Startup within a startup. Fleet management is the main product that Azuga makes, but that’s not what my team does. We do RUC. -What is RUC? Road usage charging is the following Taxes for roads come from fuel taxes. Fuel taxes are going down due to EV’s and high efficiency vehicles. States need to find an alternative to the fuel tax. Thus – road usage charging -My team has built a system to provide RUC services to states. We have been doing this since 2014. First production launch of product was July 2015 in Oregon. We are on our 11th project. We have done projects in CA, CO, WA, HI. -Oregon is going mandate next year -we do all of our engineering in India, but we are expanding and we need a US based engineer here in Colorado What is the role? If you like to get involved in the full stack of a technology product. If you get bored doing the same thing day in and day out. If you like to work directly with the business to solve real world problems with creative and innovative technology solutions.. then this is the job for you.- We need an engineer here in the US to handle US based engineering/development/reporting/technology… needs. -Role could very well grow into a senior level role in this business unit. -Role will very likely start out as a technology jack of all trades. We need someone on the team that can handle the technology aspects of what we are working on that need to be done in US time. Things like oPartner integration oDatabase architecture oReporting/business intelligence oCode review / a little coding if necessary oMentoring junior engineers (if needed) oWhat this role is not -heads down coding or a single purpose discipline -Will start out as a contract for hire – if everything goes well (you like the job). Role will turn into a permanent team position. -Role is work from home based – we do not have an office in CO anymore. Might in the future, but not right now. Need to be a self starter and can work on your own at your home easily. Must have a place you can work from in your house. – ie can close the door and keep the dogs and kids out when on conference calls. And there will be daily conference calls. Still interested?

deliverables and sprints and keep the velocity even. &nbsp;We rarely work weekends (ok, sometimes if we have a good idea) and we try to keep things flexible. &nbsp;</p><p>This means you&nbsp;get to see your&nbsp;kids school plays and games, you can run errands when there's no traffic and so on. &nbsp;So if you are someone who can manage flexibility and still get your stuff done then we are a good fit. &nbsp;If you need a lot of structure and a boss who delights in holding&nbsp;your nose to the grindstone we wish you the best of luck.</p><p>It's a trade-off. &nbsp;We don't have as much collegiality as other places. &nbsp;We are just a solid place to do good work and feel good about the work you do.</p><p>We also have a very strict no a**holes policy. &nbsp;That goes for both clients and staff. &nbsp;We avoid clients who are not nice people. &nbsp;It's better that way. &nbsp;We are also fairly diverse. Come from different places, with different faces. &nbsp;But we&nbsp;all agree that being honest, direct, and decent is by far the simplest way for professionals to act. &nbsp;And when we fail we hope&nbsp;you'll tell us in an honest, direct, and decent way. &nbsp;And then work with us to improve.</p><p>A lot of our clients are in the public sector and we try to deliver value by helping our clients be more agile and get things done by cutting through their bureaucracy. &nbsp;We believe very much in the power of agile methods and practice them both at work and in our private lives. &nbsp;We hope you join us.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible work arrangements</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>High end hardware</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Time for side projects</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We've got a job for you (and it's not dishwashing ;-) ).</p><p>Do you put them in the sink and expect someone else to do them? Move on, please.</p><p>Do you get pissed (in a professional way) when someone else leaves their dishes in the sink? &nbsp;Please apply!</p><p>TrainerRoad is looking to expand our engineering group. We're looking for smart software engineers who &quot;get things done.&quot; We’re interested in remote candidates in the USA or candidates interested in working in our Reno office.</p><p>Areas of work include ASP.NET MVC Backend, API, Workers, Micro Services, MS SQL Azure, Azure Queues/Tables, Azure Blob Storage, SignalR, and ASP.NET Core (on our roadmap), Azure monitoring and administration.</p><p>We're looking to hire:&nbsp;1x Web Backend Developer</p><p><strong>Web Development</strong></p><p>You'd be joining other engineers who are focused on the backend of our website.</p><p>The backend team is the&nbsp;hub between our apps (iOS/Android/PC/Mac), front-end website and data storage. We have a massive amount of data, and it's very likely that you might queue up tens of millions of items to be processed quickly and efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p>You'll also manage integrations&nbsp;with external APIs. You'll need to do all of this while not breaking our current system.</p><p><strong>Cool Things we Do</strong></p><ul><li>Every PR has a set of unit tests and&nbsp;automated UI tests&nbsp;run against it.</li><li>Every PR is code reviewed.</li><li>We have a dedicated QA team to manually check your PR (it requires four testers to sign off).</li><li>Every PR that is approved is automatically deployed&nbsp;(CI).</li><li>We've got a beta system that has a flow of production data that helps you develop and test your code without worry of breaking things.</li><li>Everything is hosted on Azure. There's plenty of dev/beta/test servers and databases to use.</li><li>The web team has its own Product Manager.</li><li>We run two-week sprints.&nbsp; The web team reviews, estimates, and discusses all sprint issues before they are free to be worked.</li><li>We often pair program.</li><li>The majority of our engineers are remote.</li><li>We have a front-end team that works in Angular 2+ and React (meaning you won't have to&nbsp;do UI work).</li><li>We have a skilled design team that handles the HTML/LESS for the website (again, no UI work for you).</li></ul><p><strong>Who&nbsp;We're Looking For</strong></p><p>We want smart engineers who get shit done! Not only do you have to be smart, you have to be pragmatic.</p><p>Let's say you need to paint a room white.</p><p>Smart and Pragmatic Engineer: A pragmatic engineer fills up a sprayer (rather than use a paintbrush), gets to work, and makes sure they don't paint themselves into a corner.</p><p>Smart Engineer (but not pragmatic): A smart engineer who's not pragmatic might design a system to change the color of the room in just 30 seconds.&nbsp; Sure, it would take 2 months to build the system but we could change colors so quickly!&nbsp; It's totally optimized for repainting!</p><p>If the second example sounds like you, please do not apply.&nbsp; We know it's fun to go hog wild in projects but we need to &quot;get shit done&quot;.&nbsp; There's a whole line of other engineers and designers waiting for that room to get painted so they can do their own work on it.</p><p><strong>We're a Team, not a Family</strong></p><p>It sounds harsh to say, but we're not a Family. I know lots of businesses call themselves&nbsp;a family, but I think it's BS. If you get drunk at work and yell at someone, we're going to let you go (although we would give Grandma a pass at Thanksgiving).</p><p>It's better to think of TrainerRoad like a sports team. Everyone has their role and their jobs.&nbsp; It's our jobs as managers to bring new hires up to speed, train them in our system, and coach them to be successful.</p><p>If someone is not performing, we need to talk to them, coach them, find out what's going wrong and where we can improve.&nbsp; If someone just can't perform to the standard level of the team and we can't coach them to get better, we have to let that person go.</p><p>Another clear sign that you have a high-performance team is that if everyone would &quot;enthusiastically rehire&quot; each other for their current roles.&nbsp; It really makes work wonderful when you respect, trust and value your co-workers.</p><p><strong>Required Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>C# Experience - Intermediate to Advanced&nbsp;proficiency</li><li>Cloud Experience - Azure or AWS</li></ul><p><strong>Optional Technology Experience</strong></p><ul><li>ASP.net MVC</li><li>LINQ</li><li>Web API</li><li>Azure</li><li>SQL</li><li>Build/Test CI (We use TeamCity)</li></ul><p><strong>Work Remote or in Reno, Nevada</strong></p><p>We're looking for the best candidate we can find in the US. Three-quarters of our development&nbsp;team work remotely. It works very well with the help of Slack and Github.</p><p>We expect remote employees&nbsp;to overlap at least 6 hours with the Reno, Nevada office (we're there 8am-5pm Pacific time).</p><p><strong>Salary</strong></p><p>We're looking to hire engineers for&nbsp;110k/year. &nbsp;If you ask for more, we'll reject your application.

We've found that the best way to find great engineers is to have&nbsp;them&nbsp;code, not just answer trivia questions during an interview.</p><p>That's why we require applications to do a refactoring exercise as part of their job submission. The right candidate&nbsp;won't find this a pain in the ass; it should be enjoyable.</p><p>This also weeds out the vast majority of candidates&nbsp;who just fire off resumes everywhere.</p><p>You can find the refactoring exercise with instructions here:&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/trainerroad/BackendRefactorChallenge' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/trainerroad/BackendRefactorChallenge</a></p><p><strong>Excited about our Company?</strong></p><p>In your application let us know why you want to work with us and why you think you'd be a good fit for our company.</p><p><strong>FAQs</strong></p><p><strong><em>Do I have to be a cyclist to apply?</em></strong></p><p>Nope! Not everyone in the company is a cyclist. It helps if you're an active racer but it's not required. If you are a racer or TrainerRoad user, let us know!</p><p><strong><em>What's unlimited vacation mean?</em></strong></p><p>The CEO of TrainerRoad used to be an engineer at a Fortune 500 company where life was a grind. We believe employees put out their best work when they are happy and not burnt out.</p><p>If your brain just isn't working at 3 pm, we encourage employees to go home and rest up. It does no one any good to sit and stare at the computer screen for another two hours. We don't track that time.</p><p>Employees generally shoot for around four weeks of REAL vacation time (no slack checking) but some take more, and some take less. &nbsp;The thing we care about is how productive you can be and how much value you can add to the company. Bottom line, we want people who are passionate and get things done. If you meet those requirements, everything else works itself out.</p><p>That being said, if you end up taking massive amounts of vacation, come in late, leave early and aren't producing outstanding work we're going to have a problem.</p><p><strong><em>How do you work?</em></strong></p><p>We're big believers in&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692' rel='nofollow'>Deep Work</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Superman-Decoding-Ultimate-Performance-ebook/dp/B00BW54XVO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1511803668&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+rise+of+superman' rel='nofollow'>Flow</a>. If you're not turning off Slack (snooze), going DND on your phone and shutting off the world for multiple hours a day you're probably not being as productive as you could be. The idea is a developer should be able to work on a chunk of work that they understand distraction-free for multiple hours totally.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is the only way the company moves forward.</p><p>We try to work as pragmatically as we can. &nbsp;We have excellent designers on staff who go from mockups to responsive HTML with light javascript work.</p><p>Development uses Github with a strict&nbsp;pull request process. We test, comment, refactor and improve each other's pull requests.</p><p>We have partial test coverage, and we're constantly improving in that area.</p><p>We have a QA team (we call them the Test Team) that checks every PR and does full regression checks for each App release, and we're continually getting more automated.</p><p>We have an Automation Team that only focuses on writing UI tests to speed up testing and find bugs faster.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our app on Alpha, Beta, and Production channels.</p><p>We can one-click deploy our website to Azure (includes smoke tests and warm up).</p><p>We have nightly builds that deploy to Test Flight and Google Play.</p><p>We often pair program via Slack.</p><p>We work off bi-weekly sprint issue lists on Github.</p><p>Developers get super-fast machines and awesome equipment. If it's going to let you be more productive, we want to spend the money on it.</p><p><strong><em>You didn't ask about education, what's required?</em></strong></p><p>Please put your education on your resume, but we're not going to reject someone because they don't have a degree in Computer Science. We understand that some of the best and most passionate&nbsp;engineers are self-taught.</p><p><strong><em>How long until I hear a response from you guys? What's the process?</em></strong></p><p>If you don't follow directions in this job posting, you'll be immediately rejected. &nbsp;</p><p>If you did follow directions, our goal is to review your refactoring within a week of submitting your application. All refactoring reviews are done &quot;blind&quot;; meaning the reviewer doesn't know your name, resume or where you're from. &nbsp;Code&nbsp;is code, and it should be reviewed that way without bias.</p><p>If we like your refactoring, we'll have you do a coding logic quiz. Nothing super in-depth CS wise. &nbsp;We've found that the candidates who do the best on these exercises are very successful at TrainerRoad.</p><p>We'll take the top combined refactoring and coding quiz results and set you up for a team interview.</p><p>If the team likes you; we'll then set up a pair programming session with you and an engineer. &nbsp;We'll give you a tour of our codebase and work on a real issue. This gives you a chance to run away from our codebase screaming and also demonstrate that you can communicate with us.</p><p>If all of the above is good, you're hired! &nbsp;</p><p>I know this sounds like a lot of hoops to jump through, but it works so so well! &nbsp;Once you're onboard, you'll love that everyone else went through the same process and is up to &quot;your level&quot; in terms of &quot;get-shit-doneness&quot;.</p><p><strong><em><strong><em>What's with the dishes analogy?</em></strong></em></strong></p><p>Doing your own dishes is a GREAT analogy for our culture. &nbsp;Don't leave shit around for someone else to clean up. &nbsp;Do your own dishes. &nbsp;Do you see someone making a mess? Let's discuss it (in a productive manner) so that we can nip that behavior in the bud.</p><p>We know we're really doing well when someone points out a manager&nbsp;not &quot;doing their dishes&quot; or causing an extra headache for a process that doesn't add value (it happens). Seriously, we need employees to call managers out on this. &nbsp;I'm the CEO writing this; please oh please tell me if I'm messing up or not walking the talk.</p><p><strong>Want more detail about the benefits?</strong></p><p>You can see a preview of TrainerRoad's health benefits here:&nbsp;<a href='https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27' rel='nofollow'>https://www.zenefits.com/benefits-preview/?token=3733c1ac-fc72-420a-b224-d9a25bcc1e27</a></p><p><strong><em>This is the longest job posting ever, when does it end?</em></strong></p><p>Right now!

Tasks will involve everything from implementing pages in ASP.NET MVC Razor (HTML+CS+JS) to making backend services. This is a &quot;junior&quot; to &quot;early-career&quot; position. Expect bit variety in tasks, and you can learn a lot!\\n\\nSince we launched Likvido in April 2018, we’ve absolutely nailed it. Not only do we now have 1.000+ customers - among many of the hottest startups and scaleups in Denmark - we also managed to get very serious funding, have very good unit economics and built a really cool technical platform. However, we’re just getting started.\\n\\nSo what are we doing?\\n\\nWe are solving the biggest reason for companies going bankrupt in Europe. You see, 19 % of all invoices are paid late, and roughly half of all bankruptcies are caused by lack of cash.\\n\\nLikvido is defining a new category we’re calling a “customer payment system”. Today you integrate Likvido with your accounting system, and then we automate sending out invoices, send our reminders, start debt collection and post back to the accounting system. Looking ahead, we will add financial products, give the whole organization access to our system and much more. In brief, we help companies get paid - on time - and forecast their cash flow.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n The platform is ~18 months old. We have a big monolith ASP.NET MVC application, combined with 3 solid ASP.NET Core microservices. Everything is hosted in Azure and Github, and we use many of the Azure products, including Azure DevOps. The frontend is based on the &quot;Porto Admin Theme&quot; (typical Bootstrap admin theme), and we use a mix of Vue.js (complex pages) and jQuery (on simple pages).\\n\\nThe job:\\nYou will be tasked to implement MANY different things. Examples:\\n\\n- Implement design files in HTML+CSS+JS (in ASP.NET MVC Razor)\\n- Make (simple) backend services that store data\\n- Fix bugs in solution\\n- Make web-jobs\\n- Improve the user experience\\n- Write unit tests\\n\\nBasically, you will receive a large variety of whatever tasks on the platform. The plan is you will be the most junior on the team, and you will get many of the &quot;simplest tasks&quot; in many different categories\\n \\n\\n# Requirements\\nThis is a &quot;junior&quot; to &quot;early-career&quot; position. So the most important things for us:\\n\\n- You're smart &amp; ambitious\\n- You have some kind of educational background (preferably University) in relation to software development\\n- You will need to have at least a few years of experience in .NET technologies and ASP.NET MVC (full-time experience not required). \\n- You will need to have at least a few years of experience in building JavaScript + HTML + CSS solutions (full-time experience not required)\\n\\nYou're of course welcome to apply if you have more experience. However, expect the salary to reflect the expected role, not your experience. \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",
