We use them to produce car valuations, provide vehicle history checks and help dealers and insurance companies to thrive. It's an exciting time to join the business, we're growing fast on the back of epic success and we're well funded by some of London's leading VCs. It seems like every day that another massive company is signing up to use our B2B offerings (and they're house hold names, too). We are the “cool guys” shaking up an archaic industry with big data and machine learning. We have an old B2C site (cazana.com) but our ‘real’ business takes place behind closed doors (B2B) on trade.cazana.com and is only open to paying business customers.</p><p>F# experience is not necessarily required, but you should have a senior level of ability in another functional language.</p><p>Main Responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Development of Data Platform (performant processing, enrichment, cleaning, etc)</li><li>Work on internal services like F# APIs, or lambda functions (sometimes in Python)</li><li>&quot;Parenting&quot; the internal projects: improving system observability, monitoring, automatizing repeatable tasks and optimizing existing solution.</li><li>Be a senior figure to less experienced team mates, answer questions and make good suggestions.</li><li>Refactoring, fixing bugs and performing code reviews.</li><li>Be able to own a task end-to-end on your own, from figuring out what is really needed all the way up to deployment – while engaging teammates for advice and to bounce ideas off along the way.</li><li>Support the data scientists by making sure the data is in the shape they need it to be to deliver.</li></ul><p>We are a Big Data company first and foremost and an interest or experience in dealing with huge data sets is welcome.</p><p>Ideal candidate should:</p><ul><li>Be responsible and work proactively.</li><li>Be persistent and care about high quality of his/her work: this includes various testing approaches (i.e. unit, integration or property-based tests), peer reviews and performance optimizations (mostly on .NET Core platform).</li><li>Be able to share his/her knowledge and experience with other team members.</li><li>Have experience with web crawling, and the nature of scraped data.</li><li>Have a good knowledge of functional programming (a lot of our current work is done in F#).</li><li>Understand event-driven architectures, streaming and actor model programming (part of the system is written in Akka.NET streams).</li><li>Be familiar with AWS platform.</li><li>Know how to automatize deployment process (defining build tasks, Infrastructure as a Code).</li><li>Know how to build efficient, multi-threaded and distributed systems.</li><li>Have general knowledge of SQL and NoSQL. Know when to use which one, based on the business needs. Experience with PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch is always welcome.</li></ul><p>What can we offer:</p><ul><li>100% remote work: the development team embraces fully remote working practices, as we are distributed across the world. Not to say it is mandatory to be remote – we have offices in London and Bucharest. If you live in either the UK or Romania, you could consider to come to one of the offices a few days a week as suits you, or full time if it that’s what makes you happy.</li><li>Flat organization structure: this is not a PLC, we do not have architecture boards etc. We organize and prioritize our tasks by ourselves, according to business needs while balancing technical priorities. We choose technologies and solutions as a group. We trust our staff to do the job well without micromanaging them.</li><li>OSS friendliness: we use a lot of open source stuff here, and we contribute developer time to improve or fix OSS projects which help us with our goals.</li><li>Chance to work in polyglot environment: we have people working in F#, R, JavaScript, PHP and Python.</li><li>If you're a remote worker, we'll fly you into London as often as you like to spend time with us (we have beer, cake, and a very small car called Bamby in our office).</li><li>Minimal meetings. Aside from a brief ~15 minute breakfast meeting on a Monday to quickly fly over what’s on the agenda across the whole business for the week, there is a distinct lack of ‘formal’ meetings in place. We communicate mostly over slack, have adhoc video calls as needed, and work pretty flexible hours.</li></ul>        </div>        <h4>To Apply</h4>        <p>Send email with your CV to <span><span>apply-9190</span> [at] <span>functionaljobs [dot] com</span></span></p>    </div>",

Day to day, you'll be collaboratively solving problems, architecting solutions, and&nbsp;expanding your&nbsp;mastery of CMS web development. If you are a tenacious problem-solver who thrives when digging&nbsp;deep into&nbsp;code and complex data sets, you will fit right in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nWe specialize in the design and development of&nbsp;enterprise&nbsp;.NET&nbsp;websites, so experience&nbsp;working with a.NET content management system (Ektron,&nbsp;Episerver, Umbraco, Sitecore, etc.) is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nSTRATEGY, DESIGN, AND&nbsp;DEVELOPMENT AS A TEAM SPORT.\\n\\nWhen you become a Senior .NET developer at&nbsp;Diagram, you'll get assigned to an account team with a strategist at the helm. Each team is responsible for working with a small group of clients, understanding their business goals, and building out a strategic roadmap to help push them forward.&nbsp;In your role, you&nbsp;can expect&nbsp;a healthy mix of&nbsp;writing code, gathering requirements, participating in design critiques, architecting solutions,and coordinating with your team and clients. Each account team operates autonomously,&nbsp;meaning that&nbsp;the strategies your team propose will drive the&nbsp;work you do—what you can accomplish is limited only by your collective&nbsp;ideas and&nbsp;abilities.&nbsp;\\n\\nLET’S GET TECHNICAL\\n\\nThe incredibly complex nature of the&nbsp;web&nbsp;projects we take on demand a wide range of technical prowess from&nbsp;our development leads. As a DiagramSenior Developer, you'll need to&nbsp;demonstrate expertise in the following areas:\\n\\n\\n* Programming Languages: C#\\n\\n* Microsoft Web Frameworks: ASP.NET, MVC, Razor, Web API\\n\\n* Database Solutions: SQL or TSQL\\n\\n* Strong understanding of&nbsp;core development concepts:&nbsp;Object-Oriented Programming (OOP),&nbsp;relational database concepts, Inversion of Control (IoC), and Dependency Injection (DI)\\n\\n* Integrating third-party solutions through Web Services or other messaging frameworks\\n\\n* Basic knowledge of IIS and setting up local sites\\n\\n* Using Git and version control\\n\\n* Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and other JavaScript frameworks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA&nbsp;HOME&nbsp;FOR DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS\\n\\nOur&nbsp;organizational&nbsp;model involves building out small collaborative teams that kick ass. If you work best when you're handed a blueprint and left alone to build in solitude for weeks on end, you might not be a good fit.&nbsp;Diagram&nbsp;developers prefer to be in the mix of things and would rather contribute to solving real problems with code than to just take orders. You are naturally curious, eager to learn,&nbsp;and play nice with others. As a developer at&nbsp;Diagram, you are treated as a professional, working with other professionals for common goals.Day to day,&nbsp;some of your responsibilities&nbsp;will include:\\n\\n\\n* Work with modern hosting&nbsp;technologies:&nbsp;Azure DevOps,&nbsp;CI/CD, AWS,&nbsp;Episerver&nbsp;DXC, Umbraco Cloud\\n\\n* Analyze, troubleshoot, and resolve&nbsp;issues&nbsp;on enterprise client websites\\n\\n* Adapt to and learn new&nbsp;and emerging .NET/CMS&nbsp;technologies\\n\\n* Communicate and convey technical concepts to clients, team members, and project managers\\n\\n* Contribute to functional requirements and technical documentation\\n\\n* Work both independently as well as collaboratively within a team\\n\\n* Propose and architect&nbsp;technical&nbsp;solutions that&nbsp;help&nbsp;drive our clients forward\\n\\n* Estimate effort for development tasks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWORKING AT DIAGRAM\\n\\nDiagram is a digital&nbsp;consultancy focused on design, development and marketing. We work with a small, exclusive set of client partners. It’s our goal to help them grow by developing strategic digital roadmaps and executing on it. We have a distributed team, with the bulk of our team based in Aurora, IL. We also&nbsp;have&nbsp;co-working space available&nbsp;in Fulton Market. We’ve been around since 1995. We're a fun, committed group of professionals dedicated to helping each team member produce the best work of their lives. We also offer great&nbsp;health&nbsp;benefits,&nbsp;a&nbsp;401k plan&nbsp;with company matching,&nbsp;free lunches on Wednesdays, and other sweet perks.\\n\\nCROSS-FUNCTIONAL TEAMS\\n\\nNo more hand-offs. Work collaboratively as part of one of our multidisciplinary teams. You’ll be contributing to ideation and decisions at all stages, actively shaping the design of everything you work on.\\n\\nOPEN PTO POLICY\\n\\nWe respect work-life balance and recognize that flexibility is key. Coordinate within your team, keep up with your work, take time off when you need it. We don't restrict or limit the amount of time off team members take. 'Nuff&nbsp;said.\\n\\nCHALLENGING WORK\\n\\nWe thrive when data is messy, problems are complex, and innovation is needed. We strive to push boundaries and continually ship value for a limited number of retainer clients. We're not a one and done shop. We value long-term client partnerships and iterative improvement.\\n\\nInterested in becoming a part of a world-class team at Diagram?\\n\\nTo Apply: To apply for this position, please send something that you feel communicates your expertise and what you're all about.

    "content": "<span></span> <span><h4>Olo</h4></span> <br> <h3>Engineering Manager Developer Support</h3> <div>  <div>   \\nAt Olo we develop an online food ordering platform used by many of the country’s largest restaurant chains, reaching millions of consumers. Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\\n\\nThe Developer Support engineering team at Olo supports our partners in their efforts to integrate with our platform. Whether it be an agency building bespoke web and mobile ordering apps for our restaurant brands, a restaurant marketplace integrating to our platform to gain access to Olo customer restaurants, restaurant technology partners building POS or loyalty platform integrations, or a third party ordering platform provider who is building a delivery capability via Olo’s Dispatch delivery brokerage service, third party developers are key components of Olo’s success.\\n\\nThe Olo Developer Support team consults with third party developers to educate them on our APIs, investigates problems reported by partners during their integration and certification, provides timely responses to questions during an integration project, facilitates access to test environments as well as our production environment, develops ongoing improvements to the Developer Portal web application that is used by partners to gain access to API documentation and manage API keys, and provides API documentation updates as needed.\\n\\nAs Engineering Manager, you will lead a team of talented developer support engineers in their efforts to deliver an exceptional integration experience to our technology partners.&nbsp; At Olo we value outcomes over output, and seek a leader who can help us understand the broader needs of our partners and deliver the support, tooling, and documentation necessary to meet those needs. You will help develop and align the team’s vision, guide their execution, remove impediments to the team’s progress, and coach them to develop and grow both their skills and impactfulness. You will foster a culture of collaboration, communication, accountability, skill sharing, belonging, mutual respect, and curiosity.\\n\\nWe expect our Engineering Managers to be seasoned engineers with the technical experience to both guide and challenge their teams. As a servant leader, your focus will be on facilitating strong team outcomes, hiring and developing engineering talent, and ensuring that we are delivering an exceptional service to our technology partners. While your primary focus will not be one of designing and developing software, we expect our engineering managers to have a strong software development foundation to be able to effectively guide their teams. As such we expect you to have demonstrable experience in software development that spans architecture and design, coding, quality best practices, and production operational concerns.\\n\\nOur technology stack is rooted in .NET and SQL Server running in an AWS infrastructure, and we leverage modern software engineering tools such as GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Datadog, and Sumo Logic, as well as heavy use of OSS.\\nThis is a full-time position. Candidates may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District, or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than 75% of our engineering team is remote!\\n\\nDesired Experience\\n\\n\\n* A&nbsp; passion for computing that extends beyond work\\n\\n* At least 8 years of software development experience with a progression to a senior technical level\\n\\n* At least 2 years of engineering management experience under an Agile operational model\\n\\n* Demonstrated ability to build and mentor a high performance team while seeking continuous improvement\\n\\n* Ability to translate business priorities into viable technology or process solutions, and deliver\\n\\n* Experience developing realistic project plans, managing stakeholder expectations, and tracking team execution\\n\\n* Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)\\n\\n* Experience managing distributed teams consisting largely of remote engineers\\n\\n* BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience\\n\\n* Excellent English writing and verbal communication skills\\n\\n* Legal right to work in the U.S.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeneficial Experience\\n\\n\\n* Experience in a technical support or developer support role\\n\\n* Experience with technical writing in a software environment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Olo\\n\\nOlo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 300 restaurant brands across 70,000 locations. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded guest interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded websites and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, over 100 million consumers use Olo to order ahead or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s (DIN), Chili’s (EAT), Denny’s (DENN), Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice (JMBA), Noodles &amp; Company (NDLS), Red Robin (RRGB), Shake Shack (SHAK), sweetgreen, Wingstop (WING), and more.

All applicants receive consideration for employment. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\\n\\nIf you like what you read, hear, and/or know about Olo, and want to be a part of our team, please do not hesitate to apply!

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>The Developer Support engineering team at Olo supports our partners in their efforts to integrate with our platform. Whether it be an agency building bespoke web and mobile ordering apps for our restaurant brands, a restaurant marketplace integrating to our platform to gain access to Olo customer restaurants, restaurant technology partners building POS or loyalty platform integrations, or a third party ordering platform provider who is building a delivery capability via Olo’s Dispatch delivery brokerage service, third party developers are key components of Olo’s success.</p><p>The Olo Developer Support team consults with third party developers to educate them on our APIs, investigates problems reported by partners during their integration and certification, provides timely responses to questions during an integration project, facilitates access to test environments as well as our production environment, develops ongoing improvements to the Developer Portal web application that is used by partners to gain access to API documentation and manage API keys, and provides API documentation updates as needed.</p><p>As Engineering Manager, you will lead a team of talented developer support engineers in their efforts to deliver an exceptional integration experience to our technology partners.&nbsp; At Olo we value outcomes over output, and seek a leader who can help us understand the broader needs of our partners and deliver the support, tooling, and documentation necessary to meet those needs. You will help develop and align the team’s vision, guide their execution, remove impediments to the team’s progress, and coach them to develop and grow both their skills and impactfulness. You will foster a culture of collaboration, communication, accountability, skill sharing, belonging, mutual respect, and curiosity.</p><p>We expect our Engineering Managers to be seasoned engineers with the technical experience to both guide and challenge their teams. As a servant leader, your focus will be on facilitating strong team outcomes, hiring and developing engineering talent, and ensuring that we are delivering an exceptional service to our technology partners. While your primary focus will not be one of designing and developing software, we expect our engineering managers to have a strong software development foundation to be able to effectively guide their teams. As such we expect you to have demonstrable experience in software development that spans architecture and design, coding, quality best practices, and production operational concerns.</p><p>Our technology stack is rooted in .NET and SQL Server running in an AWS infrastructure, and we leverage modern software engineering tools such as GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Datadog, and Sumo Logic, as well as heavy use of OSS.<br>This is a full-time position. Candidates may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District, or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than 75% of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Desired Experience</strong></p><ul><li>A&nbsp; passion for computing that extends beyond work</li><li>At least 8 years of software development experience with a progression to a senior technical level</li><li>At least 2 years of engineering management experience under an Agile operational model</li><li>Demonstrated ability to build and mentor a high performance team while seeking continuous improvement</li><li>Ability to translate business priorities into viable technology or process solutions, and deliver</li><li>Experience developing realistic project plans, managing stakeholder expectations, and tracking team execution</li><li>Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)</li><li>Experience managing distributed teams consisting largely of remote engineers</li><li>BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience</li><li>Excellent English writing and verbal communication skills</li><li>Legal right to work in the U.S.</li></ul><p><strong>Beneficial Experience</strong></p><ul><li>Experience in a technical support or developer support role</li><li>Experience with technical writing in a software environment</li></ul><p><strong>About Olo</strong></p><p>Olo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 300 restaurant brands across 70,000 locations. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded guest interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded websites and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, over 100 million consumers use Olo to order ahead or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s (DIN), Chili’s (EAT), Denny’s (DENN), Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice (JMBA), Noodles &amp; Company (NDLS), Red Robin (RRGB), Shake Shack (SHAK), sweetgreen, Wingstop (WING), and more.

Our companies are taking mandated professional education to the next level as we produce tools, courses, and job aides that help customers achieve more in their days and their careers.  We help professionals become licensed, stay licensed and gain the skills to perform at the top of their fields.</p><p>Essential Skillset: TypeScript, Angular 6+, Unit Testing (Jasmine/Karma), Experience consuming APIs. GitNice to have: Knowledge of relational databases and SQL .NET / C#</p><p>What You’ll Do: As a Software Engineer, you’ll play a key role in building and testing new features and frameworks for supporting an ecosystem of common web applications used by many subsidiaries within the Colibri Group family of companies. You’ll work as a member of the technology team to collaborate with UX, product management, QA and other software engineers to define new features, estimate and implement them. Your main duties will start within the TypeScript/Angular framework, which will be consuming a .NET API, which you will have the opportunity to work on as well. In addition to creating tests with Jasmine/Karma and completing peer reviewed pull request into our production environment.</p><p>Responsibilities: We practice continuous delivery and work in an agile environment. You'll design and implement critical elements of architecture and application components for common offerings. The ideal applicant pays close attention to detail, is inquisitive, able to be self-directed while open to collaboration. We follow an unapologetic “no ego” release process where fellow engineers input opinions and suggestions on the code you would like to release to production, thereby attempting to ensure the highest quality code is released. You’ll be working on a team that owns the code from development through release into production, for multiple applications, deploying a DevOps model of complete ownership.</p><p>A bit more about the position: The position will involve support of several of our web applications. Foremost among these would be the customer dashboard. Our dashboard is setup to serve our different subsidiary companies with the same set of code. It is angular, with a dash of ionic (which we have been slowly moving away from while staying committed to angular.) The dashboard is actively developed with 11,000 commits over the last two years. As a developer on the membership/mobile team we are concentrating on improving our customers membership experience by adding and improving features to the dashboard. Other applications you will have the opportunity to interact with are a c#.net api application, a .net student course runner application as well as older .net internal applications.</p><p>We run in an agile pattern with two week sprints, story point estimating, daily zoom standups, and sprint retrospectives. Our sprint planning meetings typical have developers discussing what the highest priority is with direction from the product owner and divvying up the sprint work as the developers see fit. The position is 100% remote, with the occasional in person all engineering meetings which occur for a few days every year or two. We have typically had new developers on the team spend a sprint working on improving test coverage as it allows them to get into the code and understand the code base.</p><p>Interested in this job?

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\\n\\nThe Software Infrastructure engineering team at Olo is responsible for the cross-cutting software services and frameworks that enable our product engineering teams to iterate on ideas quickly and deliver reliable services at scale. With Olo’s rise as a key player in restaurant e-commerce (you likely have used our services, even if you didn’t realize it!), we are exploring new architectural paradigms and approaches to enable our future growth. Olo has built a reputation for reliability, and our Software Infrastructure team serves a key role in delivering that exceptional reliability at an ever-increasing scale.\\n\\nAs Engineering Manager, you will lead a team of talented engineers in the day-to-day development of new platform services and frameworks. At Olo, we value outcomes over output, and seek a leader who can help us understand the broader needs of our product engineering teams and deliver solutions to meet those needs. You will help develop and align the team’s vision, guide their execution, remove impediments to the team’s progress, and coach them to develop and grow both their skills and impact. You will foster a culture of collaboration, communication, accountability, skill sharing, belonging, mutual respect, and curiosity.\\n\\nWe expect our Engineering Managers to be seasoned engineers with the technical experience to both guide and challenge their teams to build robust, high-performing solutions. As a servant leader, your focus will be on facilitating strong team outcomes, hiring and developing engineering talent, and ensuring that our systems are ready to support emerging business priorities. While your primary focus will not be one of designing and developing software, we expect our engineering managers to have a strong software development foundation to be able to effectively guide their teams. As such we expect you to have demonstrable experience in software development that spans architecture and design, coding, quality best practices, and production operational concerns.\\n\\nOur technology stack is rooted in .NET and SQL Server running in an AWS infrastructure, and we leverage modern software engineering tools such as GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Datadog, and Sumo Logic, as well as heavy use of OSS.\\n\\nThis is a full-time position. Candidates may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District, or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than 75% of our engineering team is remote!\\n\\nDesired Experience\\n\\n\\n* A&nbsp; passion for computing that extends beyond work\\n\\n* At least 8 years of software development experience with a progression to a senior technical level\\n\\n* At least 3 years of engineering management experience under an Agile operational model\\n\\n* Demonstrated ability to build and mentor a high performance team while seeking continuous improvement\\n\\n* Ability to translate business priorities into viable technology solutions, and deliver\\n\\n* Experience in, and good understanding of, large scale, highly performant, distributed systems architecture and principles\\n\\n* Experience developing realistic project plans, managing stakeholder expectations, and tracking team execution\\n\\n* Experience instrumenting, deploying, and monitoring production code to enable timely incident detection and response\\n\\n* Adept at writing unit tests and testable code, and working under distributed version control (preferably Git)\\n\\n* Experience managing distributed teams consisting largely of remote engineers\\n\\n* BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience\\n\\n* Excellent English writing and verbal communication skills\\n\\n* Legal right to work in the U.S.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Olo\\n\\nOlo is the on-demand interface for the restaurant industry, powering digital ordering and delivery for over 300 restaurant brands across 70,000 locations. Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded guest interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly.

    "content": "<h3>Senior Python Backend&nbsp;Developer</h3><div>Full-time</div><div>Boca Raton</div><div>Remote job</div><div>Small business</div><div>            <div>Posted Oct 15 – Accepting applications</div>        <h4>Who we are</h4><p></p><p>We are Worthy - and so are you! We want to democratize capital by making money more accessible for those who need to borrow it and by making investments with strong returns available to those who would like a better financial future.</p><p>We want to help people grow a nest egg even if they think they can’t… and to do it while supporting Main Street, not Wall Street!</p><p>Our first product is a free micro-investment app that helps you save &amp; grow your money – a dollar at a time. It monitors your everyday spending and rounds up each transaction to a whole dollar. It then automatically invests every $10 into a 5% interest earning Worthy Bond, which in turn supports small creditworthy businesses across the U.S., helping to strengthen our local communities.</p><p>We are a remote-first company with offices in sunny Boca Raton, Florida. We avoid the noise of Slack, but we use Twist, Keybase and Confluence to keep in sync. We’re on Gitlab to take advantage of their integrated CI/CD pipeline (we love continuous stuff!) and issue tracker.</p><h4>Who you are</h4><p>You’re an experienced backend web developer who has worked for 5+ years on a few production web apps and APIs at scale. Experience working on financial or accounting applications preferred.</p><p>You use Python on a daily basis for various tasks, from APIs to scheduled tasks and maintenance scripts.</p><p>You can design and implement an API and future-proof it. You have a strong opinion on whether APIs should be versioned in the URI or in a response header, and can defend that opinion. You know how to upgrade an API while keeping it backwards-compatible for older clients.</p><p>You’re aware of which data fits best in a relational database and which in a document-oriented one. You can use a framework-provided ORM, but can also jump in and fine-tune SQL queries when needed. You know enough database management to create and maintain an efficient schema in PostgreSQL, indexes and all.</p><p>You’re experienced enough to avoid most bugs and programming errors, but you use tools such as linters and write unit &amp; integration tests to catch all the others.</p><p>You can secure both internal and public-facing APIs using different methods, including one-time passwords (TOTP) for two-factor authentication. You consider security and privacy when designing any new features or reviewing existing code.</p><p>Most importantly, you can communicate clearly and efficiently in writing, as well as in online video/audio calls. You can handle the async (over)communication requirements of a remote-first environment and can manage your own time and productivity.</p><p>For everyone’s sake, you develop on either OS X or a Linux flavor. We don’t do windows.</p><p>You are eligible to legally work in the U.S. as a full-time employee. Given the role’s responsibilities, this is a hard requirement, even though we will have other positions where we can hire more liberally. Note that this doesn’t require actual presence in the U.S. (expats welcome!).</p><h4>What you’ll do</h4><p>We’ve build a solid, stable serverless API using Zappa on AWS Lambda. Our infrastructure is mostly managed via Terraform and our deployments are one-click, thanks to Gitlab’s CI/CD pipelines. While we rely on third parties for some key features, we’ve never had any downtime caused by anything we wrote.</p><p>Concretely, you’ll help build new business features as we grow our offerings. You will help us trim our backlog and keep technical debt in check. Since we already have robust test coverage, you will help maintain that by writing unit and integration tests for all new features and any bugs fixed.</p><p>You will also perform light devOps duties via Terraform and (rarely) manually, such as Gitlab instance upgrades or bastion security checks and updates. You’ll participate in planning &amp; prioritization meetings to help estimate complexity and think of creative solutions to business and growth problems.</p><p>You are required to have at least basic experience with our existing stack, but more importantly, you need to have the ability and desire to learn and adapt.</p><h4>What you’ll get</h4><ul><li>you can work remote from anywhere in the U.S. or from our office in Boca Raton, FL</li></ul><ul><li>you’ll set your own work schedule, as long as you can deliver and be productive (we prefer two 3-hour focused, uninterrupted work sessions, with morning, lunch and evening communication breaks to stay in sync)</li><li>competitive salary for a remote position</li><li>health insurance &amp; stock options</li><li>more benefits as we continue growing</li></ul><h4>How to apply</h4><p>We don’t do resumes. They only prove who signed your previous paychecks.</p><p>Send us your Git(hub/lab/bucket) profile, places where we can “see” your backend code in production, along with a short email explaining what kinds of problems you solved in the past, and how you did it.</p><p>In essence, please convince us we’re a good fit for each other with any arguments you’d like.</p><p>We’ll contact you by phone or email for a quick chat, then we’ll set up a video call with the CEO and CTO.</p><p>There will be no gimmicky interview quizzes or whiteboard tests. Instead, we’ll ask you to show us some code, either from a previous job or, if NDAs prevent that, we’ll write some together. This is not to test you under pressure, but to filter out the inevitable applicants who are trying to fake it till they make it.</p><p>We’ll ask you to try out something new and talk us through it, whether it’s a new framework, concept (GraphQL instead of REST?) or an AWS service neither of us used before. We do this to see if you’re willing and able to learn new things and how you handle bumping into small obstacles on the way to delivering something that works, however trivial.</p><p></p>  </div>",

For us, this means a user can install our management tool and in bulk do things like keep software up to date, enforce patch policies, perform remote desktop support, etc.<br><br>We are open to taking risks with technology, we invented a new remote desktop tool that has a plan html5/javascript remote desktop client that runs in all browsers!</p><p>We're building a company that has fun inventing. We go fast, and our customers love us. Thousands of repair shops and IT Professionals all over the world rely on our platform for their entire business operations. In fact this role can frequently start a feature and ship it to production the same day!<br><br>We are different - we really do care, the founders are writing this ad and looking at the resumes - not a recruiter or HR department.<br><br>We are using azure and teamcity, lots of dotnet. The client uses typescript, webRTC, and websockets.<br><br>We need help building this Windows &quot;management agent.&quot; This is a small team (a couple people) in part of our tight knit development org. You'll know everyone by name, chat a lot in Slack, and have the freedom to pick the technology we use.<br><br>If this sounds like the kind of team you want to be part of, we want to hear from you.<br><br>Do you play around with new stuff for fun?<br>Have any cool side projects to test out a new technology?<br>Do you hear about a problem and just obsessed building a web app to solve it?<br>If this sounds like your kind of play - we might be a great fit. :)<br><br><strong>HIGHLIGHTS:</strong><br><br>-Salaried position designed to grow with the company (seriously, try us).<br>-We want this to be your dream job - but we need your help (tell us how).<br>-We will advance your career like nobody else -- stay with us for the long haul and we'll keep you challenged, learning, passionate, and growing.<br>-Results-oriented: Keep having fun and shipping code and you can design your day.<br>-We are currently a dispersed team working from home and a few regional offices (Seattle, Bellevue, Bay Area, Orange County). (WeWork - super cool space&nbsp;<a href='https://www.wework.com/locations/seattle/south-lake-union' rel='nofollow'>https://www.wework.com/locations/seattle/south-lake-union</a>)<br><br><strong>WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING:</strong><br><br>-Lots of building and inventing.<br>-Helping discover and flesh out new product ideas. (Roadmap has like 100 new features we're anxious to get to!)<br>-Keeping us up to date with what you are learning in your spare time.<br>-Bringing in new technology you discover that might solve a problem.<br>-Coming up with improvements to many areas that are still sort of minimum viable state.<br><br><strong>WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR:</strong><br><br>-A few years of building applications, designing interfaces, etc.<br>-Intermediate/Expert in Windows (CSharp/Windows APIs) and .NET<br>-Experience in TeamCity<br>-Lots of experience with the Windows OS - things like Services, system tray, IPC, Networking, long run processes, WCF, WPF, WinForms, etc.<br>-No specific education necessary. (really)<br>-You're always learning and teach yourself. (Watch conference talks? Go to dev meetups?)<br>-...So you must be a self-driven, self-learner (autodidacts ftw).<br>-Excellent communication skills - verbal, written and electronic.<br>-You care -- which means sometimes putting yourself out there for a customer experiencing pain.<br>-Ability to multi-task in a fast paced environment.<br>-You're kind and wily (in a good way).<br><br><strong>HOW TO GET HIRED BY US:</strong><br><br>Write us about a recent time or two that you caused a production outage, what the root cause was, and what you learned from it.<br><br>For example; Troy our Founder shipped a typo in a class name a bit ago and those are annoying because they might be easily missed in Development environment but then production blows up. This led to a more robust CI+Staging step than we had prior. (web side)<br><br>Just demonstrate that you are an individual, you have a personality, you enjoy life, and you enjoy good work.

For us, this means a user can install our management tool and in bulk do things like keep software up to date, enforce patch policies, perform remote desktop support, etc.<br><br>We are open to taking risks with technology, we invented a new remote desktop tool that has a plan html5/javascript remote desktop client that runs in all browsers!</p><p>We're building a company that has fun inventing. We go fast, and our customers love us. Thousands of repair shops and IT Professionals all over the world rely on our platform for their entire business operations. In fact this role can frequently start a feature and ship it to production the same day!<br><br>We are different - we really do care, the founders are writing this ad and looking at the resumes - not a recruiter or HR department.<br><br>We are using azure and teamcity, lots of dotnet. The client uses typescript, webRTC, and websockets.<br><br>We need help building this Windows &quot;management agent.&quot; This is a small team (a couple people) in part of our tight knit development org. You'll know everyone by name, chat a lot in Slack, and have the freedom to pick the technology we use.<br><br>If this sounds like the kind of team you want to be part of, we want to hear from you.<br><br>Do you play around with new stuff for fun?<br>Have any cool side projects to test out a new technology?<br>Do you hear about a problem and just obsessed building a web app to solve it?<br>If this sounds like your kind of play - we might be a great fit. :)<br><br><strong>HIGHLIGHTS:</strong><br><br>-Salaried position designed to grow with the company (seriously, try us).<br>-We want this to be your dream job - but we need your help (tell us how).<br>-We will advance your career like nobody else -- stay with us for the long haul and we'll keep you challenged, learning, passionate, and growing.<br>-Results-oriented: Keep having fun and shipping code and you can design your day.<br>-We are currently a dispersed team working from home and a few regional offices (Seattle, Bellevue, Bay Area, Orange County). (WeWork - super cool space&nbsp;<a href='https://www.wework.com/locations/seattle/south-lake-union' rel='nofollow'>https://www.wework.com/locations/seattle/south-lake-union</a>)<br><br><strong>WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING:</strong><br><br>-Lots of building and inventing.<br>-Helping discover and flesh out new product ideas. (Roadmap has like 100 new features we're anxious to get to!)<br>-Keeping us up to date with what you are learning in your spare time.<br>-Bringing in new technology you discover that might solve a problem.<br>-Coming up with improvements to many areas that are still sort of minimum viable state.<br><br><strong>WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR:</strong><br><br>-A few years of building applications, designing interfaces, etc.<br>-Intermediate/Expert in Windows (CSharp/Windows APIs) and .NET<br>-Experience in TeamCity<br>-Lots of experience with the Windows OS - things like Services, system tray, IPC, Networking, long run processes, WCF, WPF, WinForms, etc.<br>-No specific education necessary. (really)<br>-You're always learning and teach yourself. (Watch conference talks? Go to dev meetups?)<br>-...So you must be a self-driven, self-learner (autodidacts ftw).<br>-Excellent communication skills - verbal, written and electronic.<br>-You care -- which means sometimes putting yourself out there for a customer experiencing pain.<br>-Ability to multi-task in a fast paced environment.<br>-You're kind and wily (in a good way).<br><br><strong>HOW TO GET HIRED BY US:</strong><br><br>Write us about a recent time or two that you caused a production outage, what the root cause was, and what you learned from it.<br><br>For example; Troy our Founder shipped a typo in a class name a bit ago and those are annoying because they might be easily missed in Development environment but then production blows up. This led to a more robust CI+Staging step than we had prior. (web side)<br><br>Just demonstrate that you are an individual, you have a personality, you enjoy life, and you enjoy good work.

The process of quickly creating small changes, collecting feedback and then improving them incrementally is critical to providing the best possible solution for our customers.&nbsp;</p><p>2 ) We believe in **<strong>a balance between professional and personal lives**</strong>. We work with focus and energy during the day and then we go home to attend to our health, family and personal lives. During a crisis, it may be necessary for everybody to be involved for as long as it takes, but these circumstances should be rare.</p><p>3 ) We believe **<strong>learning</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and growth are vital**</strong>. Career development, coaching and training are not optional or secondary. They are necessary for our growth as individuals and our growth as a company.</p><p>4 ) We believe in **<strong>team ownership**</strong>. We commit to goals as a team and it is the team's responsibility to ensure the job is done. We do not say, &quot;It's not my job&quot;. We support each other and hold each other accountable to achieve our goals.</p><p>5 ) We believe in **<strong>doing what's best for our customers**</strong>. We listen to, guide and do our utmost to satisfy our customers both internal and external. Sometimes that means diverging from what a customer is explicitly asking for and guiding them towards the solution that is in their best interest.</p><p>6 ) We believe in a **<strong>bias towards action**</strong>. A good solution today is better than a perfect solution tomorrow.</p><p>7 ) We believe in **<strong>extensive automation**</strong>&nbsp;of routine tasks. Our single biggest cost is our salaries. We hire intelligent, talented people and we need them to work on activities that require their skills. Routine activities are relentlessly automated.</p><p>8 ) We believe in **<strong>consistency where it matters and autonomy where it doesn't**</strong>. It is important for teams to make decisions that are specific and pertinent to their success. Where it is necessary, we will agree on department wide standards. Where it doesn't matter, we believe the team is best suited to make that decision for themselves.</p><p>9 ) We believe in **<strong>making decisions based on a variety of perspectives**</strong>. Decisions made by a single individual are risky and are necessarily skewed by that person's perspective. A wide range of perspectives, personalities and backgrounds helps to produce better decisions. This does not mean we are a democracy. We believe that it is sometimes best for a leader to gather input from a qualified group of people and make an informed decision.</p><p>10 ) We believe in using the **<strong>simplest solution that effectively solves the problem**</strong>. Complexity that adds no value is both expensive to build and costly to maintain.&nbsp;</p><p>11 ) We believe that we must be **<strong>good stewards of the company's assets**</strong>. We all share responsibility in making sure we are using NAVEX's money and property effectively. Making good budgetary decisions is everybody's responsibility.</p><p>12 ) We believe that we must **<strong>operate by the highest ethical standards**</strong>. We are an ethics and compliance company. We as an organization and as individuals must hold each other accountable to behaving in a way that is in keeping with NAVEX's and our customers' high expectations for ethical behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>13 ) We believe in using the **<strong>best tool for the job**</strong>. Often that means adopting the latest technology.

No part of the code base is off limits.\\n\\nOlo is revolutionizing the customer experience with restaurant chains, and we're looking for talented engineers to join our team and help achieve this vision.

    "content": "<div>Syncro is a small team crafting applications helping small business be more successful. Our software has a primary component that is a &quot;remote machine management&quot; tool. For us, this means a user can install our management tool and in bulk do things like keep software up to date, enforce patch policies, perform remote desktop support, etc. We are open to taking risks with technology, we invented a new remote desktop tool that has a plan html5/javascript remote desktop client that runs in all browsers! We're building a company that has fun inventing. We go fast, and our customers love us. Thousands of repair shops and IT Professionals all over the world rely on our platform for their entire business operations. In fact this role can frequently start a feature and ship it to production the same day! We are different - we really do care, the founders are writing this ad and looking at the resumes - not a recruiter or HR department. We are using azure and teamcity, lots of dotnet. The client uses typescript, webRTC, and websockets. We need help building this Windows &quot;management agent.&quot; This is a small team (a couple people) in part of our tight knit development org. You'll know everyone by name, chat a lot in Slack, and have the freedom to pick the technology we use. If this sounds like the kind of team you want to be part of, we want to hear from you. Do you play around with new stuff for fun?Have any cool side projects to test out a new technology?Do you hear about a problem and just obsessed building a web app to solve it?If this sounds like your kind of play - we might be a great fit. :) HIGHLIGHTS: -Salaried position designed to grow with the company (seriously, try us).-We want this to be your dream job - but we need your help (tell us how).-We will advance your career like nobody else -- stay with us for the long haul and we'll keep you challenged, learning, passionate, and growing.-Results-oriented: Keep having fun and shipping code and you can design your day.-We are currently a dispersed team working from home and a few regional offices (Seattle, Bellevue, Bay Area, Orange County). (WeWork - super cool space ) WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING: -Lots of building and inventing.-Helping discover and flesh out new product ideas. (Roadmap has like 100 new features we're anxious to get to!)-Keeping us up to date with what you are learning in your spare time.-Bringing in new technology you discover that might solve a problem.-Coming up with improvements to many areas that are still sort of minimum viable state. WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR: -A few years of building applications, designing interfaces, etc.-Intermediate/Expert in Windows (CSharp/Windows APIs) and .NET -Experience in TeamCity -Lots of experience with the Windows OS - things like Services, system tray, IPC, Networking, long run processes, WCF, WPF, WinForms, etc.-No specific education necessary. (really)-You're always learning and teach yourself. (Watch conference talks? Go to dev meetups?)-...So you must be a self-driven, self-learner (autodidacts ftw). -Excellent communication skills - verbal, written and electronic.-You care -- which means sometimes putting yourself out there for a customer experiencing pain.-Ability to multi-task in a fast paced environment.-You're kind and wily (in a good way). HOW TO GET HIRED BY US: Write us about a recent time or two that you caused a production outage, what the root cause was, and what you learned from it. For example; Troy our Founder shipped a typo in a class name a bit ago and those are annoying because they might be easily missed in Development environment but then production blows up. This led to a more robust CI+Staging step than we had prior. (web side) Just demonstrate that you are an individual, you have a personality, you enjoy life, and you enjoy good work. And please include a resume. :) SyncroMSP is an equal opportunity employer. Pay: DOE. Let's Talk.</div>",

We unify collaboration technologies like voice, video, and messaging on a single cloud-based platform so users can experience greater efficiency and less hassle each workday. The company is growing rapidly as we move full steam ahead toward our anticipated IPO. Now’s the time to bring your passion and expertise to our Fuze team!</p><p>Our customers use our software across a variety of platforms including Windows, OS X, iOS, Android and web. We build our software to work and provide a great experience across all of these platforms. Whenever possible we use open source technologies like WebRTC or OPAL. Where it makes sense we build our own software stacks. The Real Time Communications team also builds linux-based microservices that provide audio, video, screen share, content, recording and interoperability gateway functions. These microservices use a combination of REST APIs and IETF standards based protocols to provide functionality to our desktop, mobile and web-based clients. These microservices are built with scalability, resiliency and performance in mind.</p><p>The primary task of the Real Time Communications team is to build the heart of our product — the software stacks that power the audio and video communications within our product. This team works across both the client and backend stacks. Within this team you will get exposure to a broad range of technologies and challenges.</p><p>As much as possible we develop cross platform code — sharing code across clients and sometimes between the clients and various backend services. We believe strongly in modularity and code reuse. As we’re developing cross platform code that is often times CPU intensive and performance critical we tend to use C++ as our language of choice for code that requires portability between the clients and servers.</p><p>In this position you will be responsible for owning, developing and maintaining key components in our client media framework or the backend media services. You will develop services that are deployed globally and run in mixed environments including our own datacenters and AWS. You will be responsible for making key technical recommendations and then executing on your recommendations.You will be responsible for coming up with and implementing innovative solution to difficult problems. You must be hands on and have a passion for developing software.</p><p><strong>What You Will Need:</strong></p><ul><li>Expert C++ coding skills with minimum of 7 years experience</li><li>Experience with streaming media protocols (SIP, SDP, H.323)</li><li>Experience developing real-time audio/video communication systems leveraging RTP/RTCP and audio codecs such as Opus, G.711, G.722</li><li>Experience developing networking software including working with socket level programming and UDP/TCP</li><li>Experience developing and shipping high quality applications for OS X, Windows, iOS or Android is an asset</li><li>Experience building production Linux based services is an asset</li><li>Experience with WebRTC</li><li>Experience with Go and/or Python is a plus</li><li>Understanding of the various trade offs when dealing with real-time media</li><li>Drive, passion, dedication and a good attitude</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.fuze.com/careers#!/job/1713684' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We're building a digital assistant that takes care of the financial paperwork for entrepreneurs, saving them time, money and a lot of frustration and worries.</p><p>In the past months we&nbsp;worked hard on the business case, the design, finding funds and building a prototype (in Vue.js). Now it's time to bring her to life! And therefore we need you: a talented full stack developer that wants to join us on our journey.</p><p>As we are building our product from scratch, you have the unique opportunity to be part of the team, right from the very first lines of code. We offer you a&nbsp;playground where you can put all your passion in building a piece of software to be proud of. Software that is scalable and maintainable and can easily grow along with our customer base and the size of our team. Software that is secure and protects the data of our clients.</p><p>We expect you to be our technical guru. The go-to person that follows the latest trends in web and mobile development, juggles with .NET, Azure, React (Native), Apollo and GraphQL. The one that leads the way and coaches his fellow developers but learns from them at the same time. We’re too small for “overhead”, so we’re not looking for a manager but rather a passionate developer with strong analytical, engineering and people skills.</p><p><strong>Your job</strong></p><ul><li>You’re responsible for the software architecture and the quality of our code</li><li>You “lead by example” as one of the most driven and structured developers of the team</li><li>You coach your fellow developers when needed</li><li>You introduce best practices for coding and conduct regular code reviews.</li><li>You believe in our product and take up and active role in shaping its roadmap</li><li>You defined the test strategy &amp; make sure quality is monitored with automated tests&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Required Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Designing &amp; developing back-ends in the Microsoft technology stack ( C#, .NET, .NET Core, .NET, SQL Server)</li><li>Web/native app development with ASP.NET Core, React/Apollo &amp; HTML5/CSS</li><li>Api development with GraphQL</li><li>Designing&nbsp;scalable and secure&nbsp;architectures in Azure</li><li>Notions of mobile app development with Object C/Swift and&nbsp;Java/Kotlin</li><li>Strong communication skills</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/290221?reset=False&amp;ra=1zkwPIbSfLpK&amp;oqs=a%3D1zkwPIbSfLpK' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>a true “start-up” experience</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>a small team, lots of hard work, fun and impact</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>ownership &amp; responsibility to build with us the product we dream of</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
