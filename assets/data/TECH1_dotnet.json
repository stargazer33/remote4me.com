We believe each member is equally valuable, and we treat them as such. We are looking for a top-notch back end Architect who can make the important tech choices, be hands-on in developing those choices, and grow a small engineering team to assist. Initially, you will be wearing many hats as is typical in the start-up realm.<br /><br />You will be responsible for the Architecture, Roadmap, and Development of the application. Please note we are open to various technology platforms. The person we are looking for has a vast back end mobile application development experience and can guide us on best practices. Slot gaming knowledge is a strong plus, but it’s not necessary if you’re willing to learn. You must also be strongly self-directed, good at managing timelines, and good at working independently and as a team member as this is very collaborative.<br /><br />Our offices are located in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles – Remote work is fine.<br /><br />The Tech Stack<br />You get to influence this! Currently, we're thinking the back end will be in Java. <br />We're also considering Go, Rust, Python, Node.js, or even C# - if you can make a strong case as to why being locked into the Microsoft infrastructure is preferable. Come to us with strong opinions and a willingness to discuss engineering trade-offs.<br /><br /><br />Experience we are looking for:<br /><br />    You must have worked on back end projects deployed for iOS, Android, and/or both.<br /><br />    We want someone who has developed a mobile app and has been on a small team. Show us that you’ve had ownership of some part of a program you’ve worked on.<br /><br />    Start-up experience is really nice to have. Gaming experience is a plus.<br /><br />    It'd be nice if you've led a team in the past, as this position has the opportunity to grow into a managerial role as we grow the company.<br /><br />    You must have sysadmin / operations experience and be able to set up infrastructure for the app, preferably in a cloud context - systems, network, monitoring, security, etc. <br /><br />We plan on making a number of build-or-buy decisions so experience with integrating third-party tools and/or services is a plus.<br /><br />    Also a huge plus: experience scaling a consumer-facing service, particularly with respect to tuning for performance and reliability."

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Olo is revolutionizing the customer experience at these restaurant chains, and we're looking for talented engineers to join our team and help achieve this vision. As part of the team you will play a significant and visible role in helping us scale one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the market.

Our mission is to help make more of those experiences happen by transforming the way entertainment organisations sell tickets and build relationships with their audiences.<br /><br />Spektrix has grown considerably over the past few years, growing from 100 clients in the UK to over 300 both in the UK and North America. We sell over 20m tickets through our B2B SaaS platform. And we’re only just getting started.<br /><br />We’re bringing new clients on to the Spektrix platform weekly. This involves live migrations of millions of ticket sales (past and future), customer records and fundraising activities from their legacy systems into Spektrix.  We have built a reputation of making this migration process as smooth as possible for our clients, so that they can carry on with “business as usual” from their first day on Spektrix.<br /><br />*The job*<br />--<br />We are looking for a data migration engineer to join our data migration team. You will be leading data migration projects end to end while working closely with the rest of the data, techOps and implementation teams.<br /><br />You’ll work collaboratively with all stakeholders, including clients and our business team, to balance the client’s needs with delivering the project on time. You will occasionally visit clients and understanding their requirements will be part of your responsibility.<br /><br />You will develop and maintain the data importer to deliver improvements, include new functionality, improve efficiency and keep data integrity. You’ll be taking ownership of existing tools, as well as building from scratch when we come across systems we’ve never migrated from before.<br /><br />You’ll need to quickly get your head around the foreign data sets you’re provided with and use your problem solving skills to work out how to transform these into the Spektrix format. <br /><br />Working with others in your team to find the best solution, often times with lots of opinions, but no egos.<br /><br />We work innovatively, seeking new ideas and sharing new insights from blogs, conferences, and ultimately learning from mistakes! We learn through regular development talk sessions, held every couple of weeks.<br /><br />The role includes supporting our New York implementation team and North American clients, so the role has potential to develop to include travel and a permanent move to the US office.<br /><br />*Some of the technologies we use*<br />--<br />Our system is a multi-tenant, scalable SaaS platform. For data migrations we use the following technologies:<br /><br />* C# console applications<br />* SQL Server<br />* Powershell<br />* Full Convert<br />* JIRA / Trello / Confluence / Google Apps<br />* Stash (Git) Source Control / Bitbucket / Bamboo<br /><br />*What we're looking for*<br />--<br />* You will have strong SQL skills, whether that is from SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL or Postgres. Preferably with experience migrating data between different systems, platforms and database schemas.<br />* You can quickly analyse, understand and translate between vastly different implementations of common concepts.<br />* You will enjoy running projects from inception to delivery. You believe the best way to serving clients is by getting close to them.<br />* You are a great communicator, able to  explain complex processes both verbally and in writing. You have experience writing process or specification documentation.<br />* You are comfortable working to deadlines and have the ability to prioritise your workload to meet changing circumstances. You are able to concisely and efficiently communicate project progress and risks. You know who are your key stakeholders and what information they need.<br />* You will have an interest in the wider technical community, looking for ways to learn new  approaches to tackling complex problems as well as sharing your own story."

Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile or tablet device.</p><p><strong>Who We Need</strong></p><p>Cultural Fit - While we hire all kinds of people and invent roles to fit them, there are three key traits we require of every team member that really define our team.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Fun to Work With - Life is short and work should be fun. &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Extremely Smart - We work on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can both architect and code these systems at the same time while working with a highly intelligent peer group. &nbsp;</li><li>Passionate Engineers - We need people who really love programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in what you do.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Types of Roles</strong></p><p>We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform. &nbsp;Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general &quot;gist&quot; of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast &quot;good enough&quot; approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in &quot;science experiment land&quot;</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>US Person based anywhere in the US (100% remote allowed but no off shore)</li><li>5 Years work experience as a programmer</li><li>Highly Comfortable with C# and Visual Studio</li><li>Experienced with Web Development &amp; JavaScript</li></ul>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/124860?reset=False&amp;ra=FScjxUoprcQ&amp;oqs=a%3DFScjxUoprcQ' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About MapLarge</h2>            <div><p>MapLarge provides Big Data Analytics and Visualization to make us safer, more productive, and more efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our platform powers high traffic website visualizations, data discovery, and business intelligence applications.

But lawyers are terribly served by traditional recruitment agencies, who rely on anonymised web ads or inexperienced cold callers to engage potential legal recruits.<br /><br />Our founders, Tom Balmer and David Crocker, have been involved in the establishment and growth of some of the best names in the legal recruitment industry since the early noughties.  In 2017 they launched Third Way Legal, a marketplace platform designed to change the way lawyers engage with the jobs market.<br /><br />Third Way is a unique network, where lawyers can confidentially see which firms are looking for lawyers like them (in some ways it is similar to workinginstartups.com!). Following an amazing first year, where we have grown to 6 people and are annualising a million in turnover, we now are looking to build an in-house tech team.<br /><br />It's an extremely exciting time to join the business.  We are expanding into the interim market, looking to grow into new geographies, and have so many new feature ideas it hurts.  We're looking for a full-stack developer, comfortable with front and back end development, who is pragmatic and can eager to grow with the firm.  If that sounds like you, and you'd like to join us on our journey to change the legal recruitment industry, please get in touch!"

Du kan rätta fel och&nbsp;lägga till features&nbsp;genom att programmera i befintlig teknik, men också vara med och driva utvecklingen för&nbsp;den nya produkten.</p><p>Du gillar förmodligen precis som oss att utforska och använda nya teknologier i utvecklingsarbetet mot framtidens webbapplikationer. Du har själv - på fritiden eller i tidigare jobb - arbetat med hela produkten från design, arkitektur, back-end och front-end till deployment. Kanske har du en publik GitHub med något spännande projekt!?&nbsp;</p><p>Du&nbsp;har erfarenhet av ASP.NET web forms&nbsp;men också intresse av nyare teknologier. Vi gillar&nbsp;och tror att framtiden är att bygga snabba moduler i med frond-end i React.</p><p><strong>Vårt företag<br></strong>På e-Avrop utvecklar vi ett omfattande IT-stöd för upphandling, där svenska och utländska myndigheter, kommuner och företag får hjälp med hela upphandlingsprocessen.</p><p>Vår produkt har mängder av spännande funktionalitet såsom visuella processmodeller, rättighetsstyrd dokumenthantering, och realtidslösning för auktioner. Vi ser också många möjligheter för framtidens utveckling, med både business intelligence, machine learning och annat smart användande av vår samlade data. Allt för att kunna erbjuda nya och bättre tjänster inom området.</p><p>Vårt mål är att utveckla en enkel och kraftfull plattform med stor flexibilitet för upphandlare och företag. Vårt fokus ligger i att användarupplevelsen ska kännas modern, snabb och ha genomtänkt gränssnitt.&nbsp;</p><p>När vi träffas ses vi i trivsamma lokaler på&nbsp;Östermalm i Stockholm, ett stenkast från Tekniska Högskolan. Övrig tid jobbar vi effektivt hemifrån, med dagliga scrum-möten online.</p><p><strong>Arbetsuppgifter</strong><strong><br></strong>Den huvudsakliga arbetsuppgiften är underhåll av den befintliga web-applikationen för upphandlingsstöd samt viss nyutveckling i varierande teknologier. Vi jobbar i korta sprintar med prioriterad backlog.</p><p>Arbetet omfattar hela kedjan från rent underhållsarbete och bug-rättningar till feature requests med design av gränssnitt, datamodell,&nbsp;och teknisk lösning.</p><p>Vår utveckling sker främst i .Net-miljö (ASP.NET web forms) men mycket av våra nyare lösningar innefattar modernare gränssnitt skrivna i React, AngularJS och ren javascript. Vi använder självklart senaste verktygen såsom Visual Studio Resharper/Rider och Webstorm. Vi kör både macOS och Windows och hanterar kod med GitFlow. Vi har ett agilt tänk och har i nuläget en helt automatisk byggprocess och deployment.<br><br><strong>Din profil</strong><br>Vi tror att du är civilingenjör, datavetare eller motsvarande och har arbetat ett par år med systemutveckling. Du är van med att implementera webbservices och andra API:er såsom REST med flera och har goda kunskaper inom webbtekniker. Vidare tror vi att du har erfarenhet inom .NET, ASP web forms, C# och javascriptsbaserade front-end teknologier.&nbsp;</p><p>För att lyckas i rollen tror vi att du är analytiskt lagd, har ett strukturerat arbetssätt med en adaptiv syn på teknologi. Du kan arbeta självständigt och i grupp samt har lätt för att sätta dig in i, förstå och använda nya verktyg och koncept inom systemutveckling.
