We are proud to deliver high quality, well-loved software (and some hardware) to music lovers and audiophiles all over the world. Our subscribers are more than customers; they’re fans who share our passion for music and participate vigorously in the community that surrounds our product, which has become the gold standard for music players in the “audiophile” world.</p><p>Roon Labs is a self-funded, profitable small business founded in 2015 which currently has 20 employees. All of its principals are hands-on and work for the company full time. We’re growing at a quick but manageable pace –&nbsp;80-100% year-on-year subscriber growth.&nbsp;</p><p>When we founded the company, we set out to delight the most demanding music enthusiasts and audiophiles, not to acquire a billion users. That vision stands today… we don’t have outside investors because we don’t want our product vision to conflict with our business goals. Roon is a premium-priced offering designed for a specialist audience, so we don’t need massive scale and we avoid the risk of being forced into an exit by business pressures.</p><p>Roon Labs is notionally headquartered in New York, but we have no offices. Instead, our team is distributed across three continents, and everyone works remotely. Many members of our team travel extensively around the world. We have a long history of working this way, and we love the flexibility and lifestyle that it allows.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health/Dental/Vision (80/20)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k with match</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Paid Parental Leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Time Off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full Time Remote</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

If you are the type of engineer that gets excited about complex AWS architectures, and beautiful code, then we are looking for you.<br>&nbsp;<br>Regardless of role or experience, the recipe for success contains the following ingredients:<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>YOUR PERSONALITY</strong><br>• Ambition. We want to do big things... and have an out-sized effect on our customers and entire industries. We’re looking for people who want to be part of that.<br>• Problem ownership.

But we’re not satisfied with or distracted by the journey; we’re focused on our shared outcomes.<br>• Relentless optimism. We want to surround ourselves with people who see the glass half-full, people who think in terms of possibilities.<br>• All in. Making mistakes is necessary for innovation. But we want to be sure we maximize effort, creativity and collaboration.<br>• Technical. Our hobby is coding, our favorite destination is hackathons, and we binge-watch Coursera...<br>• Communication. Writing and talking about code is the major part of our day.<br>&nbsp;<br>There is room for a range of skills. Some you already have and some you will quickly gain when you are here.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>REQUIRED SKILLS:</strong><br>• Cloud (AWS)<br>• Designing REST APIs<br>• AWS Lambda<br>• AWS Cloud Formation<br>• AWS Cloud Trail<br>• AWS Cloud Watch<br>• Languages (Any supported by AWS Lambda: Java, Angular, Python, Node.js, C#/.Net Core 3.1)<br>• Minimum of five years of experience building production quality cloud products<br>• Minimum two years of experience with AWS, DevOps, CI/CD<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>IMPORTANT SKILLS:</strong><br>• Swagger<br>• Agile (Scaled Agile Framework)<br>• DevOps (Infrastructure as Code, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery)<br>• Behavioral Driven Development<br>• Design and Architecture<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>PERKS:</strong><br>• Opportunity to work with people who are at the top of their field<br>• Career growth<br>• Collaborative learning environment<br>• Working in teams with global IT experts<br>• Working on enterprise level applications</p>            </div>        <div>        <a href='https://authoritypartnersinc.catsone.com/careers/86212-General/jobs/13422333-Senior-AWS-Lambda-CloudFormation-API-Developer?ref=StackOverflow' rel='nofollow'>            Apply        </a>                            </div>            <h4>About Authority Partners</h4>            <div><p>Authority Partners is a leading and global IT services company with over 20 years of experience, serving clients within the financial, healthcare, insurance, mortgage and technology sectors amongst many others.

We want to surround ourselves with people who see the glass half-full, people who think in terms of possibilities.<br>• All in. Making mistakes is necessary for innovation. But we want to be sure we maximize effort, creativity and collaboration.<br>• Technical. Our hobby is coding, our favorite destination is hackathons, and we binge-watch Coursera...<br>• Communication. Writing and talking about code is the major part of our day.<br><br>There is room for a range of skills.

Analysts using our geospatial visualization capability can instantly visualize and publish for data discovery and model testing on any desktop, mobile or tablet device.</p><p><strong>Who We Need</strong></p><p>Cultural Fit - While we hire all kinds of people and invent roles to fit them, there are three key traits we require of every team member that really define our team.</p><ol><li>&nbsp;Fun to Work With - Life is short and work should be fun. &nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;Extremely Smart - We work on cutting edge hard problems and we need people who can both architect and code these systems at the same time while working with a highly intelligent peer group. &nbsp;</li><li>Passionate Engineers - We need people who really love programming and exhibit the energy and creativity that comes from being fully engaged in what you do.</li></ol><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Types of Roles</strong></p><p>We need talented people to help add cool new features to our platform. &nbsp;Below are the general categories of tasks we are working on, but often people straddle multiple areas so take them more as the general &quot;gist&quot; of what you might do with us. We are looking for smart, hard working, fun people and we will invent the right role to fit them. &nbsp;The key trait we are looking for is people who like to both architect/design and write the code for complex systems. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(1) Client Side - </strong>Interactive Visuals: We maintain a JavaScript API for for interactive Data Visualization using our high performance web services. We need people both to help add new dynamic animated UI components and other features to the JS API. We also need people to build data driven visuals for our demo gallery if you are artistically or data analysis inclined. Enjoy working with Knockout, Angular, D3.js, HTML5? Check our our galleries to see the kind of stuff you will be working on <a href='http://maplarge.com/demos' rel='nofollow'>http://maplarge.com/demos</a></p><p><strong>(2) Full Stack Web Services -</strong> Full stack developers who are comfortable working on both client and server side to produce high performance applications powered by scalable web services are the backbone of our team. &nbsp;We run c# in both .net and mono server side and also maintain a flexible client side API with a large library of reusable components. We host and run large deployments that sometimes scale to thousands of computers for scientific/industrial/gov users and in a typical day process data over 15 billion records from 110 million streaming data sources. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>(3) Algorithm / Core Database Development - </strong>&nbsp;We built our own in memory database and distributed data analytics pipeline from the ground up with funding from DARPA, and we have a team of really talented researchers working on Pattern analysis, Streaming analytics, Spatial queries and Network graph functions that power our visual engines. We are always looking for practical people who love writing highly optimized code that straddles the line between research and software development. We don't usually publish scientific papers, but we are right out on the edge pulling algorithms out of the latest research papers finding really fast &quot;good enough&quot; approaches that let us tease interesting patterns out of data without getting lost in &quot;science experiment land&quot;</p><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>US Person based anywhere in the US (100% remote allowed but no off shore)</li><li>5 Years work experience as a programmer</li><li>Highly Comfortable with C# and Visual Studio</li><li>Experienced with Web Development &amp; JavaScript</li></ul>            </div>        <div>            <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/124860?reset=False&amp;ra=FScjxUoprcQ&amp;oqs=a%3DFScjxUoprcQ%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>                                <span>Easy apply</span>            </a>                            </div>            <h4>About MapLarge</h4>            <div><p>MapLarge provides Big Data Analytics and Visualization to make us safer, more productive, and more efficient. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our platform powers high traffic website visualizations, data discovery, and business intelligence applications.

Day to day, you'll be collaboratively solving problems, architecting solutions, and&nbsp;expanding your&nbsp;mastery of CMS web development. If you are a tenacious problem-solver who thrives when digging&nbsp;deep into&nbsp;code and complex data sets, you will fit right in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We specialize in the design and development of&nbsp;enterprise&nbsp;.NET&nbsp;websites, so experience&nbsp;working with a.NET content management system (Ektron,&nbsp;Episerver, Umbraco, Sitecore, etc.) is required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>STRATEGY, DESIGN</strong><strong>, AND</strong><strong>&nbsp;DEVELOPMENT AS A TEAM SPORT.</strong></p><p>When you become a .NET developer at&nbsp;Diagram, you'll get assigned to an account team with a strategist at the helm. Each team is responsible for working with a small group of clients, understanding their business goals, and building out a strategic roadmap to help push them forward.&nbsp;In your role, youcan expect&nbsp;a healthy mix of&nbsp;writing code, gathering requirements, participating in design critiques, architecting solutions,and coordinating with your team and clients. Each account team operates autonomously,&nbsp;meaning that&nbsp;the strategies your team propose will drive the&nbsp;work you do—what you can accomplish is limited only by your collective&nbsp;ideas and&nbsp;abilities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LET’S GET TECHNICAL</strong></p><p>The incredibly complex nature of the&nbsp;web&nbsp;projects we take on demand a wide range of technical prowess from&nbsp;our development leads. As a Diagram&nbsp;Web&nbsp;Developer, you'll need to&nbsp;demonstrate expertise in the following areas:</p><ul><li>Programming Languages: C#</li><li>Microsoft Web Frameworks: ASP.NET, MVC, Razor, Web API</li><li>Database Solutions: SQL or TSQL</li><li>Strong understanding of&nbsp;core development concepts:&nbsp;Object-Oriented Programming (OOP),relational database concepts, Inversion of Control (IoC), and Dependency Injection (DI)</li><li>Integrating third-party solutions through Web Services or other messaging frameworks</li><li>Basic knowledge of IIS and setting up local sites</li><li>Using Git and version control</li><li>Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and other JavaScript frameworks</li></ul><p><strong>A&nbsp;</strong><strong>HOME</strong><strong>&nbsp;FOR DEDICATED PROFESSIONALS</strong></p><p>Our&nbsp;organizational&nbsp;model involves building out small collaborative teams that kick ass. If you work best when you're handed a blueprint and left alone to build in solitude for weeks on end, you might not be a good fit.&nbsp;Diagram&nbsp;developers prefer to be in the mix of things and would rather contribute to solving real problems with code than to just take orders. You are naturally curious, eager to learn,&nbsp;and play nice with others. As a developer at&nbsp;Diagram, you are treated as a professional, working with other professionals for common goals.Day to day,&nbsp;some of your responsibilities&nbsp;will include:</p><ul><li>Work with modern hosting&nbsp;technologies:&nbsp;Azure DevOps,&nbsp;CI/CD, AWS,&nbsp;Episerver&nbsp;DXC, Umbraco Cloud</li><li>Analyze, troubleshoot, and resolve&nbsp;issues&nbsp;on enterprise client websites</li><li>Adapt to and learn new&nbsp;and emerging .NET/CMS&nbsp;technologies</li><li>Communicate and convey technical concepts to clients, team members, and project managers</li><li>Contribute to functional requirements and technical documentation</li><li>Work both independently as well as collaboratively within a team</li><li>Propose and architect&nbsp;technical&nbsp;solutions that&nbsp;help&nbsp;drive our clients forward</li><li>Estimate effort for development tasks</li></ul><p><strong>WORKING AT DIAGRAM</strong></p><p>Diagram is a digital&nbsp;consultancy focused on design, development and marketing. We work with a small, exclusive set of client partners. It’s our goal to help them grow by developing strategic digital roadmaps and executing on it. We have a distributed team, with the bulk of our team based in Aurora, IL. We also&nbsp;have&nbsp;co-working space available&nbsp;in Fulton Market. We’ve been around since 1995. We're a fun, committed group of professionals dedicated to helping each team member produce the best work of their lives. We also offer great&nbsp;health&nbsp;benefits,&nbsp;a&nbsp;401k plan&nbsp;with company matching,&nbsp;free lunches on Wednesdays, and other sweet perks.</p><p>CROSS-FUNCTIONAL TEAMS</p><p>No more hand-offs. Work collaboratively as part of one of our multidisciplinary teams. You’ll be contributing to ideation and decisions at all stages, actively shaping the design of everything you work on.</p><p>OPEN PTO POLICY</p><p>We respect work-life balance and recognize that flexibility is key. Coordinate within your team, keep up with your work, take time off when you need it. We don't restrict or limit the amount of time off team members take. 'Nuff&nbsp;said.</p><p>CHALLENGING WORK</p><p>We thrive when data is messy, problems are complex, and innovation is needed. We strive to push boundaries and continually ship value for a limited number of retainer clients. We're not a one and done shop.

As part of our growth, we are now looking for enthusiastic C# developers to design, develop and implement our products.</p><p>Our products integrate school management systems with Active Directory, Office 365, G Suite, SharePoint and other products. Although mainly written in C# they use many different technologies to integrate with all the different systems, from REST and SOAP web APIs to direct database access and custom object models.&nbsp; We use agile methodologies as much as possible. The product set has been developed over the last 12 years and so is quite mature, but there are constant changes as new features are added to the systems we integrate with and as we add support for new products. &nbsp;In addition to our suite of customer-facing products we also produce software using various modern technologies to support our operations team deliver the best experience they can. We also have plans for developing several cloud-based products soon.</p><p>SalamanderSoft currently consists of 18 employees, the majority of which are operations/support staff. We are a small close-knit company and our ethos is to provide excellent service to our customers and to be the best at what we do. This is reflected in the fact that all our sales are via word of mouth/recommendations – we do not have a sales team, and we are still growing strongly. All our roles are remote working, so you will be working from home.</p><p>We have a great reputation with our customers as evidenced by this thread on EduGeek:&nbsp;<a href='http://www.edugeek.net/forums/recommended-suppliers/160503-salamandersoft-singing-praises.html' rel='nofollow'>http://www.edugeek.net/forums/recommended-suppliers/160503-salamandersoft-singing-praises.html</a></p><p><strong>Who we are looking for</strong></p><p>The current development team consists of 2 full-time developers together with the company founder devoting about half his time to development. We are now looking for additional team members to enable further growth of the company and product set. The role is home-based so you will need to be comfortable and effective working from home. Although home-working sounds great and offers a lot of flexibility, it is not for everybody.</p><p>The exact skills we are looking for will depend on your experience, although C# is a core requirement. Your attitude will be key and we will be looking for someone who:</p><ul><li>uses their initiative and gets things done</li><li>has successfully delivered at least one project</li><li>has enthusiasm and interest in development and technology</li><li>wants to be the best that they can be and strives for excellence</li><li>can work independently and remotely</li><li>has a hunger to learn new skills</li><li>wants to drive best-practices and processes</li><li>for a senior developer, we would also be expecting agile skills, especially test-driven development</li></ul><p>As this is a remote role you will need a suitable area for working in your home, a broadband connection and probably a kettle. All other equipment and tools will be provided.</p><p>All applicants must be UK based and legally entitled to work in the UK. Also, due to the nature of the sector we work in, we require all employees to be DBS checked.</p><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>If you are interested in joining our team, please apply through Stack Overflow or write to us at&nbsp;<span></span><a href='mailto:careers@salamandersoft.co.uk' rel='nofollow'>careers@salamandersoft.co.uk</a>&nbsp;with anything you want to support your application.

Provisioning, maintaining and managing users in Active Directory, Office 365, Exchange, G Suite, Apple School Manager and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The backbone of our services is our dedicated support team, who provide all the configuration and support for our products ensuring that our customers' systems do not need to change to take advantage of automation. Supporting over 2000 schools in 13 countries across the world our solutions currently manage over 1.5 million accounts daily. Our customers range from individual schools up to country scale implementations with every size in between. Over the 12 years of the company’s existence we have gained an unrivalled reputation for our excellence and configurability of our services and continue to strive to improve this.&nbsp;We have a great reputation with our customers as evidenced by this thread on EduGeek:&nbsp;<a href='http://www.edugeek.net/forums/recommended-suppliers/160503-salamandersoft-singing-praises.html' rel='nofollow'>http://www.edugeek.net/forums/recommended-suppliers/160503-salamandersoft-singing-praises.html</a></p><p>What enables our support team to deliver our customer service are our products and the development team which builds them. Currently this is a small team of 2 full time developers which we are aiming to grow so we can build all the cool tools our support team needs. Based in Hull the team mainly works from home, but also spends a couple of days a week working in our offices in C4DI. Working with cutting edge technologies, while still supporting the legacy systems still in use in schools every project is different. Our aim is to write great code which allows the support team to customise the solution exactly to the customer's needs. We place more importance on getting the code right than just shipping product through the door – in the long run that leads to unmaintainable code and disappointed customers.&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Significant autonomy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>The ability to drive best practices and processes</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Paid Certification attempts</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>A chance to work on the latest technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Support in improving your current skillset</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

You will have significant autonomy and ability to drive best practices and the direction of the team. We care about the quality of the code we produce and will take the time to improve existing code while adding new functionality. We are passionate about best practices including using test-driven development.\\n\\nWe will provide all the tools needed to do your job and help you in improving your skill base. You will have a key role in developing some new products without undue interference from management as well as:\\n\\n\\n* A chance to work on the latest technologies, including .NET Core\\n\\n* Integrate with the latest developments from Microsoft and Google, including Microsoft Graph and Azure\\n\\n* The ability to drive best practices and processes within the development team\\n\\n* Significant autonomy\\n\\n* Exposure to the full development lifecycle\\n\\n* Training resources and all appropriate technology, software and tools will be provided\\n\\n* Support you in improving your current skill set and to work with and develop new ones\\n\\n* The opportunity to attend some conferences/events/training during the year\\n\\n* A competitive salary, dependent on experience together with pension contributions\\n\\n* Flexibility in working hours when required\\n\\n* The opportunity to get rid of your daily commute\\n\\n* 5 weeks paid holiday per year plus bank holidays\\n\\n* Expenses paid on any business travel\\n\\n* Paid Certification attempts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis is a fully remote home-based role, although we are looking for UK based developers as there are occasional in-person meetings.\\n\\nWho are we?\\n\\nSalamanderSoft is a small but growing software house providing integration products and services to the education sector in the UK. As part of our growth, we are now looking for enthusiastic C# developers to design, develop and implement our products.\\n\\nOur products integrate school management systems with Active Directory, Office 365, G Suite, SharePoint and other products. Although mainly written in C# they use many different technologies to integrate with all the different systems, from REST and SOAP web APIs to direct database access and custom object models.&nbsp; We use agile methodologies as much as possible. The product set has been developed over the last 12 years and so is quite mature, but there are constant changes as new features are added to the systems we integrate with and as we add support for new products. &nbsp;In addition to our suite of customer-facing products we also produce software using various modern technologies to support our operations team deliver the best experience they can. We also have plans for developing several cloud-based products soon.\\n\\nSalamanderSoft currently consists of 18 employees, the majority of which are operations/support staff. We are a small close-knit company and our ethos is to provide excellent service to our customers and to be the best at what we do. This is reflected in the fact that all our sales are via word of mouth/recommendations – we do not have a sales team, and we are still growing strongly. All our roles are remote working, so you will be working from home.\\n\\nWe have a great reputation with our customers as evidenced by this thread on EduGeek:&nbsp;http://www.edugeek.net/forums/recommended-suppliers/160503-salamandersoft-singing-praises.html\\n\\nWho we are looking for\\n\\nThe current development team consists of 2 full-time developers together with the company founder devoting about half his time to development. We are now looking for additional team members to enable further growth of the company and product set. The role is home-based so you will need to be comfortable and effective working from home. Although home-working sounds great and offers a lot of flexibility, it is not for everybody.\\n\\nThe exact skills we are looking for will depend on your experience, although C# is a core requirement. Your attitude will be key and we will be looking for someone who:\\n\\n\\n* uses their initiative and gets things done\\n\\n* has successfully delivered at least one project\\n\\n* has enthusiasm and interest in development and technology\\n\\n* wants to be the best that they can be and strives for excellence\\n\\n* can work independently and remotely\\n\\n* has a hunger to learn new skills\\n\\n* wants to drive best-practices and processes\\n\\n* for a senior developer, we would also be expecting agile skills, especially test-driven development\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs this is a remote role you will need a suitable area for working in your home, a broadband connection and probably a kettle. All other equipment and tools will be provided.\\n\\nAll applicants must be UK based and legally entitled to work in the UK. Also, due to the nature of the sector we work in, we require all employees to be DBS checked.\\n\\nNext Steps\\n\\nIf you are interested in joining our team, please apply through Stack Overflow or write to us at&nbsp;   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span>&nbsp;with anything you want to support your application. Links to social media and code repositories would be great as well.\\n\\nIf you would like more information or an informal chat about the role, please contact Richard Willis,&nbsp;   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span>\\n\\nWe will offer jobs as and when the right candidates apply, so there is no fixed closing date.  </div> </div>",
