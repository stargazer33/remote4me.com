of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear. We do our work with respect, and we value truth, transparency, and honesty above all else.</li></ul><p>To Apply:&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested, please apply with a resume and introduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Please feel free to skip the formality of a cover letter and write to&nbsp;me as a human being.&nbsp; If you need to use a four letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I’ll take that over what you would think I typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are and what you want in life. Just tell me.</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/192578?reset=False&amp;ra=12AfxD422agE&amp;oqs=a%3D12AfxD422agE' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Sanborn</h2>            <div><p>We're a 25-person interactive shop working with all manner of organizations (sports teams, beauty brands, magazines, non-profits, pharmaceutical companies, startups) helping to create and manage the full battery of digital media goodness (web, mobile, content, video and experiential activations to be specific).</p><p>We believe passionate, talented people all working together smoothly yields awesome work that lets us come back and do it again tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Some more about where we stand as a company:&nbsp;<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/about</a></p><p><strong>About Our Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>The team is made of folks who seem to enjoy bouncing in and out of different projects of different sizes with varying engineering challenges associated with them.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Our designers are highly technical and our engineers are very invested in the visual fidelity of their work - so some of the lines that typically divide UI/UX and engineering cultures don't really exist here.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>At any one given time we'll have folks on longer term missions (ie - 6 to 8 month long-term projects where we're in more of a product development posture) and people on shorter term campaign-based work where we're trying to explode a firecracker in the sky, measure how far and bright it travels, and then move onto to the next one.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>We try to keep plates of work varied and diversified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Everyone is a grownup.&nbsp;</li></ul>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work friendly environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full health benefits package.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Los Angeles office locations.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shithead eco-flush system ensuring shitheadless working environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Family owned and operated.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Our smartphones and TVs, our cars and houses, even our pets and our kids are the products of purposeful creativity.</p><p>So why not our lives?</p><p>A great many of us are, currently, in a position where we might look at our jobs — or even our relationships — and wonder, “Why have I stayed here so long? Is this really where I want or even <em>need</em> to be. Am I in a position where I can do something about it?”</p><p>The simple — and sometimes harsh — the answer is that we don’t often make intentional decisions about our lives and our careers like we do in our work for clients and bosses. Instead, having once made the decision to accept a position or enter a relationship, inertia takes over. We become reactive rather than active participants in our own lives and, like legacy products, are gradually less and less in touch with the choices and the opportunities that put us there in the first place.</p><p>Or, in UX terms: We stop doing user research, we stop iterating, and we stop meeting our own needs. And our lives and careers come less usable and enjoyable as a result of this negligence.</p><p>Thankfully, all the research, design, and testing tools we need to intentionally design our lives are easily acquired and learned. And you don’t need special training or a trust fund to do it. All you need is the willingness to ask yourself difficult questions and risk change.</p>      <div>      <div>        <p>          Is your pattern library up to date today? <em>Alla Kholmatova</em> has just finished a fully fledged book on <strong>Design Systems</strong> and how to get them right.

In many ways, people have been practicing this iterative process since our ancestors first talked to each other and sketched on cave walls. Call it design thinking, UX, or simply problem-solving — it’s much the same from agency to agency, department to department, regardless of the proprietary frame.</p><a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/bb237c59-3aae-45b2-b63a-fc7353f019aa/process.gif' rel='nofollow'></a><strong>Look familiar?</strong> The design process in its simplest form.Credit: <a href='https://thenounproject.com/icon/147184/' rel='nofollow'>Christopher Holm-Hansen, thenounproject.com</a>.

This research is also used to align user and business needs with what’s technically and economically feasible. This first step in the process is tremendously freeing — you don’t need to toil in isolation. Your user knows what they need, and this research will help you infer it.</li><li><strong>Phase 2: Design</strong><br>Don’t just make things beautiful — though beauty is joyful! Focus on creating solutions for the specific needs, pain-points, and opportunities your research phase identified. And remember, design is both a noun and a verb. Yes, you deliver designs for your clients, but design is — first and foremost — a process of insight, trial, and error. And once you have a solution in mind...</li><li><strong>Phase 3: Testing</strong><br>Test early and test often. When your solutions are still low-fi (before they go to development) and <em>absolutely</em> before they go to market, put them in front of real users to make sure you’re solving the right problems. Become an expert in making mistakes and iterating on the lessons those mistakes teach you. It’s key to producing the best solutions.</li><li><strong>Repeat</strong></li></ol><p>Most design-thinking literature illustrates how the design process is applied to products, software, apps, or web design. At our agency, <a href='http://www.importantshit.co/' rel='nofollow'>J+E Creative</a>, we also apply this process to graphic design, content creation, education, and filmmaking. And it’s for that reason we don’t call it the UX design process. We drop the abbreviated adjective because, in our experience, the process works just as well for presentations and parenting as it does for enterprise software.</p><p>The process is about problem-solving. We just have to turn the process on ourselves.</p><h4>Expanding The Scope: User-Centered Parenting</h4><p>As creatives and as the parents of five elementary-aged kiddos, one of the first places we tried to apply the design process to our lives was to the problems of parenting.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7a43a5f1-643f-4648-bba2-4d30d0a319c9/shark-lego.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>Talk about a pain point.</strong> Using UX basics to solve a parenting problem opened the door to a wider application of the process and — mercifully — saved our tender feet.

They’re all right angles, unshatterable plastic, and invariably in places where you otherwise feel safe, like the kitchen or the bathroom.</p><p>But how can you research, design, and test a parenting issue — such as getting kids to pick up their Legos — using the user-centered design process?</p><h5>Research</h5><p>We’re far from the first parents to struggle with the painful reality of stepping on little plastic knives. And like most parents, we’d learned threats and consequences were inadequate to the task of changing our kids’ behavior.</p><p>So we started with a current-state contextual analysis: The kid’s legos were kept in square canvas boxes in square Ikea bookcases in a room with a carpeted floor. Typically, the kids would pour the Legos out on the carpet — for the benefit of sorting through the small pieces while simultaneously incurring the pain-point that Legos are notoriously hard to clean up off the carpet.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/1333ae93-6478-4bdd-994e-ead215ef83bb/legos.jpg' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>For reals.</strong> If your product requires me to protect myself against it in my own home, the problem might be the product.

But we didn’t assume we knew what the users wanted. So we talked to each of them in turn (no focus groups!) and what we found was eye opening. Of course, the kids didn’t want to pick up their Legos. It was inconvenient for play and difficult because of the carpet.

Or in the cubicle. Realizing your 40th really is your midlife might be the incentive you need for real change, knowing your kids will move out in a few years might help you re-prioritize, or seeing how much time you spent working on someone else’s dream might give you the motivation to start working for your own.</p><p>When I audited myself, I was shocked by how much time I’d spent at jobs that were poor fits for me. And at how little time I had left to do something else. I was also shocked to see how little time I had left with my kids at home, even as young as they are. Suddenly, the pain of sitting in traffic or spending an evening away at work took on new meaning. I didn’t resent my past — what’s done is done and there’s no way to change it — but I did let it color how I saw my present and my future.</p><h4>Usability Testing The Present: Eisenhower Charts</h4><p>Once you’ve looked back at your past, it’s time to look at how you’re spending your present.</p><p>An Eisenhower chart — cleverly named for the US president and general that saved the world — is a simple quadrant graph that juxtaposes urgency (typically, the Y-axis) with importance (typically the X-axis).

Then we prioritize our schedules around these needs.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/4d00a781-147a-4d35-a262-d1e031c65136/eisenhower-detailed.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>What’s important to you?</strong> It’s easy to get caught up in urgency — or perceived urgency — and disregard what’s important.

To identify your priorities. And as you repeat this activity over the course of weeks or even years, it makes you conscious of how you spend your time and can have a tremendous impact on how well that time is spent. Because the humbling fact is, <em>no one else</em> is going to prioritize what’s important to you. Your loving partner, your supportive family, your boss and your clients — they all have their own priorities. They each have something that’s most important to them. And those priorities don’t necessarily align with yours.</p><p>Because the things that are important to each of us — not necessarily urgent — need time in our schedules if they’re going to provide us with genuine and lasting self-actualization.

Because, if you want to paint or travel or spend time with the kids or start a business, no one else is going to put that first. You have to. It is up to you to identify what’s important and then find time for it. And if time isn’t found for your priorities, you only have one person to blame.</p><p>We do these charts regularly, both for family and business planning. And one of the things I often take away from this exercise is the reminder to schedule blocks of time for the kids. And to schedule time for the thing I’m most passionate about — writing.

Instead, we prototyped what this new business might look like before committing it to the market.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/ca82ad37-4dee-4615-92d3-37d8c0fc0fcc/prototype.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>Prototyping is serious business.</strong> We took advantage of a local hackathon to test working together and with a team before quitting our day jobs.

With common traps, gotchas and the lessons she learned. Hardcover, eBook. <em>Just sayin'.</em>        </p>        <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/design-systems/' rel='nofollow'>                      Table of Contents&nbsp;→                  </a>      </div>      <div>        <a href='https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/design-systems/' rel='nofollow'>        <div>                  </div>      </a>      </div>    </div>  <p>So when we finally launched <a href='http://www.importantshit.co/' rel='nofollow'>J+E Creative</a> full time, we already had a sense of what worked for us and what challenges required further learning and iteration. And because we prototyped, first, we had the confidence and a few clients in place so that we didn’t have to save too much money before making the change.</p><h4>The ROI For Designing Your Life</h4><p>Superficially, we designed a new business for ourselves. More deeply, though, we took control of variables and circumstances that let us meet our self-identified lifestyle goals: spending more time with the kids, prioritizing our marriage and our family above work, giving ourselves time to practice and grow our passions, and better control our financial futures.</p><p>The return on investment for designing your life is about as straightforward as design solutions get. As Bill Burnett and Dave Evans put it, “A well-designed life is a life that is generative — it is constantly creative, productive, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise. You get out of it more than you put in.”</p><p>Hopefully you’ll see how a <em>Your Life In Weeks</em> audit can help you learn from your past, how an Eisenhower chart can help you prioritize the present, and how a simple affinity mapping exercise for your wants and needs can help you see beyond money-based decisions and assess if you’re making the right decisions regarding family, clients, and project.</p>    <a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7ebf5eab-17fa-48bf-a5e6-8dfd067b62d8/balance.png' rel='nofollow'>            </a>                        <strong>Live and work, by design.</strong> Mindfully designing our lives and our careers allowed us to pursue our own business (<a href='http://www.importantshit.co/' rel='nofollow'>J+E Creative</a>) and our separate passions (<a href='http://elliedecker.com/' rel='nofollow'>elliedecker.com</a> and <a href='http://o-jd.com' rel='nofollow'>o-jd.com</a>) (<a href='https://cloud.netlifyusercontent.com/assets/344dbf88-fdf9-42bb-adb4-46f01eedd629/7ebf5eab-17fa-48bf-a5e6-8dfd067b62d8/balance.png' rel='nofollow'>Large preview</a>)            <p>It’s always a give and a take. We frequently have to go back to our affinity map results to make sure we’re still on target. Or re-prioritize with an Eisenhower chart — especially in a challenging week. And, sometimes, the urgent trumps the important. It’s life, after all. But always with the understanding that we are each on the hook when our lives aren’t working out the way we want. And that we have the tools and the insights necessary to fix it.</p><p>So schedule a kickoff and set a deadline.

Working closely with a political director, you and your A-Team will build the web and mobile pieces of a campaign to pass strong policy on your issue or stop a disastrous bill from becoming law. Your role will be to explain complex issues—and get people to take effective political action—using design, copy, and code.

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.</p><p>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. That’s a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.</p><p><br></p> <p><strong>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?</strong></p><p>We're well-funded with significant traction; hundreds of thousands of families have downloaded the RoosterMoney app since our launch in January 2016 and we have over 51 currencies being used by children around the world. RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, Wall Street Journal, New Zealand Herald to name a few. We’ve been on CNBC and are considered experts in our field.</p><p>We are now expanding across a number of markets and looking for a talented and motivated senior UI developer to join our team to help us raise our game and achieve even more amazing things. We have a generous share option scheme as we believe that everyone within the company should share in the success they help build.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>THE ROLE:</strong></p><p>We're looking for a software developer who has held senior positions on front-end engineering teams, who will operate with a high level of autonomy, ensuring impeccable reliability. You care deeply about building applications with well thought out architecture.</p><p>You will be developing our core RoosterMoney app and working across the platform as a whole within our small but growing product team (currently 8), building an application that is used by families around the world. You have a passion for UX and UI, best practice development and building a product that delights users on a daily basis, taking pride in shipping quality code that is easy to test, maintain and build on. Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node API’s where required.</p><p>We are a small team so it’s important that the successful candidate isn’t just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apply if you want to:</strong></p><ul> <li>Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.</li> <li>Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.</li> <li>Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.</li> <li>Develop robust deployment and testing processes </li> <li>Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.</li> </ul><br><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br><p><strong>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> </strong></p><ul> <li>Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.</li> <li>25 days holiday</li> <li>Pension Scheme</li> <li>Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.</li> <li>We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office.

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects while concurrently laying the foundation for a stand-alone product which will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We have an excellent four person team in place with Big-4 backend experience. We're looking to get one final person in place to help us define what a modern and maintainable front-end stack should look like and to help build our product. Hopefully that's you.</p><p>Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we aren't as familiar with. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.</p><p><a href='https://www.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://www.builtforme.tech</a></p><p><a href='https://blog.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.builtforme.tech</a></p><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href='https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

They were spending days sending out RFQs, waiting for feedback, sending drawings, asking for different quantities, waiting for more feedback, only to receive back less than optimal pricing and lead times. We also knew that designers were not always fully aware of the capabilities and limitations of the latest manufacturing technology advances.</p><p>Second, we heard frustration from machine shops, who were spending a lot of time and energy responding to inquiries for custom parts that ultimately did not happen. In addition, without extensive sales and marketing resources, many of these shops were limited to working with customers in their local area, making it difficult to grow their business.</p><p>At Xometry, we created a proprietary software platform to enable product designers and engineers to instantly access the capacity of a nationwide network of manufacturing facilities. Our platform makes it possible for customers to receive instant pricing, expected lead times and manufacturability feedback. At the push of a button, the network is able to deliver high quality parts at consistently fast lead times while offering very low prices.</p><p>We make it easy for all customers — from startups to Fortune 100 companies — to access manufacturing on demand by providing the most efficient way to source high-quality custom parts. We’re dedicated to keeping more manufacturing in America by providing an innovative way for customers to easily work with facilities across the country.</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vacation Time</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Snacks</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Otions</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Happy hours and team events</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

The experiences they publish work consistently across all browsers and devices, and all customer engagement is tracked with extensive analytics. All without writing code.</span></p><p><strong>About the Product</strong></p><p><span>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</span></p><p><span>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</span></p><p><span>We’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Chef, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</span></p><p><strong>About the Team</strong></p><p><span>As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.</span></p><p><span>We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it’s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO’s atrocious spelling.</span></p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p><span>Working completely from home, you’ll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing. We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15” Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</span></p><p><span>We believe that every piece of content created within Ceros is an experience. As such, we strive for the user’s experience to be as smooth as possible. To achieve this, we need developers with a passion for web performance. We’re looking for people with experience profiling javascript applications and squeezing every last millisecond out of the code. We want somebody that is knowledgeable in web performance best practices and strives to make code faster.</span></p><p><span>Desired experience:</span></p><ul><li><span>Object-oriented programming</span></li><li><span>Image &amp; video asset optimization (Webp, Adaptive bitrate streaming, etc.)</span></li><li><span>Asset preloading </span></li><li><span>Efficient use of caches</span></li><li><span>Building performant web animations</span></li><li><span>HTTP/2 protocol to streamline loading</span></li><li><span>Impress us with anything else you have experience with!</span></li></ul><p><span>As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves:</span></p><ul><li><span>writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying),</span></li><li><span>having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,</span></li><li><span>carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,</span></li><li><span>agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,</span></li><li><span>collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,</span></li><li><span>and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p><span>If you’re interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us. We’re a company of passionate, honest, and sometimes silly people, so don’t be afraid to express yourself.</span></p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/186544?reset=False&amp;ra=10yMLam10e64&amp;oqs=a%3D10yMLam10e64' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Ceros</h2>            <div><p>With flexible hours, a generous vacation policy and the best darn coworkers you could ask for, we don't need to resort to bribing new hires with candy from our creepy white van.</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Vacation Policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Enjoy Your Work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Top-notch Gear</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work 100% From Home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team meet-ups 3x/year</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Our tech stack is LNMP and Angular so you must have 5+ years of professional experience with current knowledge of PHP or Angular, or both. Experience in OOP/MVC concepts is a must, too.</p><p>We’re also looking for a product manager with 3+ years of PM experience, to manage one or two products with each product having 2-3 developers working on it. PM is not purely technical position but working knowledge of concepts of web technologies is required.  We’re agile/scrum shop.</p><p>You must be comfortable – and highly productive – working remotely. We do have an office in NYC but everyone else works remotely. We’d prefer if you live in one of these states - NY, CA, FL, PA, MA, or KY. If you’re international, the working hours must overlap significantly with US working hours.</p><p>Send us your resume at jobs@springshare.com or contact me personally (I’m the founder/owner) at slaven@<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

We have over two million registered users from around the world. Our primary product is an online, real time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Who We Are</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf was founded by two mathematicians who were inspired by their own experiences in academia to create a better solution for scientific collaboration and communication. Now we are a team of thirty with about a dozen developers, based mainly in and around the UK and in the US.</div><div><br></div><div>About half of our development team joined us through our acquisition of ShareLaTeX, another major online LaTeX editor, last summer, and we've now integrated the two teams.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Our Tech</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf is based on open source software, and following our integration with ShareLaTeX, around 80% of our product code is itself open source. You can find it on GitHub:&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsharelatex%2Fsharelatex' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex</a></div><div><br></div><div>We currently have two overlapping tech stacks, one from Overleaf and one from ShareLaTeX. We are working on merging them together into &quot;Overleaf v2&quot;, which is now in public beta ( https://www.overleaf.com/help/342 ) and will launch in time for the fall academic term in September 2018.</div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf v1 has a Ruby on Rails backend using PostgreSQL and redis, hosted mainly on Heroku. We also have several node.js services that we've extracted from our rails monolith. On the frontend, recent development has been with React in ES6, bundled with webpack.</div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf v2 and ShareLaTeX run on a node.js backend using MongoDB and redis, hosted mainly on Linode and managed with Chef. Here we use a microservice architecture, with about a dozen services. Mainly our code is written in CoffeeScript, but new code is being written in ES6 where possible. On the frontend, we mainly use Angular v1, with some newer components being written with React.</div><div><br></div><div>We use Docker to manage our development environments, and our devops team is currently working on moving our production infrastructure to Kubernetes. We support continuous delivery and typically deploy at least a few times a day (less on Fridays).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How We Work</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf is remote-first — all founders and staff work remotely. We also have an office by King's Cross station for those in the London area, and we get the whole team together in London several times a year for face-to-face time.</div><div><br></div><div>We encourage flexible working. Our core hours are 2pm–5pm UK time, during which we have a 10–15 minute daily standup call for the whole development team. We have few standing meetings for developers, but we do many smaller video or voice calls for pairing or within project groups.</div><div><br></div><div>We don't yet have standing teams, but we form and dissolve smaller teams on a per-project basis; we try to give everyone the opportunity to serve as a team lead if they want to.</div><div><br></div><div>We always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run many surveys and user interviews.</div><div><br></div><div>We organize our work with Kanban. We use GitHub pull requests for each feature with code review to share knowledge and best practices (and catch bugs). We test thoroughly with automated unit and acceptance tests, supported by continuous integration (CI). We're also fans of linting to minimise bike-shedding (and to catch bugs).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>About This Role</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We plan to add up to three developers to our team, two with a backend focus and one with a frontend focus. Full stack developers are also very welcome to apply.</div><div><br></div><div>This year, you will work mainly on our integration projects — building out Overleaf v2. Here are some examples of projects (large and small) we've recently completed, to give you an idea of what you might work on:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F644-two-quick-updates-to-overleaf-v2-based-on-your-feedback' rel='nofollow'>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/644-two-quick-update...</a></li><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharelatex.com%2Fblog%2F2017%2F11%2F27%2Fintegration-update-link-sharing.html' rel='nofollow'>https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2017/11/27/integra...</a></li><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F523-a-data-driven-approach-to-latex-autocomplete' rel='nofollow'>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/523-a-data-driven-ap...</a></li></ul><div><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F523-a-data-driven-approach-to-latex-autocomplete' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><br></div><div>Post-integration, we are planning projects around improved collaboration features for teams, improvements to our rich text mode, and more.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How We Hire</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The stages in our hiring process are typically:</div><div><br></div><ol><li>We will aim to update you on the status of your application within one week from when we receive it.</li><li>We'll schedule a short video or voice call to discuss your application. This is a non-technical screening call, up to 30 minutes long, in which we get to know each other and assess whether there may be a good fit. In particular, we'll discuss logistics and your ambitions and expectations, and we may ask for clarifications on your application. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions.</li><li>We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically two hours long. The first hour is discussion, and the second hour is technical. For the technical, you'll have the option of either completing a homework assignment, which requires about one hour of your time before the interview, or solving a problem in the interview, if you prefer. The problems are practical in nature (no fizz-buzz or reversing linked lists), and you can use Google, man pages, etc., and ask us questions.</li><li>We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.</li></ol><div>If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Requirements</span><br></b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>We require that you:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>have a minimum of 2–3 years of relevant experience (we aren't taking on more new graduates at the moment).<br></li><li>will work for us full time (or nearly full time).<br></li><li>will usually be available in our core hours, 2pm–5pm UK time.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Experience with the technologies we use is always a bonus, but you don't need to know them all; your ability to learn is much more important to us.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Benefits</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Remote and flexible working.<br></li><li>Salary £40k<span>–</span>£75k per year depending on experience.<br></li><li>You would join a small, dedicated and growing team.<br></li><li>We're substantially (around 80%) open source, so your work will often be on open source code.<br></li><li>We're backed by Bethnal Green Ventures ( https://bethnalgreenventures.com/ ) and Digital Science ( https://www.digital-science.com/ ), through which we're part of a wider community of startups in science, health and ed-tech.<br></li><li>Our London office is shared with several other Digital Science companies, so there's lots of interesting people to meet, and clubs and sports activities outside of work.<br></li><li>You can pick your own equipment. MacBook Pro? Lenovo ThinkPad? Notebook and pen? However you like to work, we'll provide what you need.<br></li><li>We provide a training budget; many of our developers choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.<br></li><li>We run a biweekly internal seminar series (show and tell) with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Please send us a resume and covering letter via <a href='https://overleaf.workable.com/jobs/734449/candidates/new' rel='nofollow'>https://overleaf.workable.com/jobs/734449/candidates/new</a> . </p>  </div>"

We believe time is valuable and you should be able to make the most of it. We focused on simplicity, security and scalability, to create an innovative service accessible to everyone.<br /><br />We’ve been rapidly growing over the last year and recently closed a $1.1m funding round (it’s £850k, but $1.1m sounds so much cooler doesn’t it) to fuel our global expansion. <br /><br />We’re a young team who strongly believes in making your work a positive part of your life, creating a flexible working environment and making an impact through what we do. People you know will be using our product and we take pride in offering them a good service. <br /><br />About the role:<br /><br />As a lead developer at Stasher you'll be involved in building systems that support new client-facing features as well as working to improve our internal tools and systems. Your day might range from working on our core API, to planning a new host dashboard and managing junior engineers based remotely.<br /><br />We're looking for someone with a strong overall development background to help act as the bridge between business and tech and to make architectural decisions. This means you'll have a lot of responsibility and autonomy. You should have experience with, and a love for, building scalable back end systems and beautiful front end ones. Ideally you'll have actually built a few in your time. A solid understanding of React or other MVC style frameworks and Python<br /><br />We're building part of our development team in Athens so we're open to London candidates who are happy to manage remote devs and occasionally visit, or to Athens based candidates who are happy to visit London regularly.<br /><br />Essential: <br />- Love for crafting beautiful, well-tested code. Our backend is primarily in Python (flask) and frontend is in React.<br />- Happy to work fast and can strike a good balance between quality and quantity of work <br />- 4+ years experience working within a wider team<br />- Have an opinion on development processes and infrastructure that's appropriate for a budding scale up. This is really your chance to take the helm at a fast growing and funded startup; we don't just want you to 'use the technologies you want' but to have an informed opinion on what prepares us for scale!<br /><br />Desirable: <br />- Experience with Django or Flask. <br />- Experience with Heroku<br />- Experience with React<br />- Experience at a scale-up<br />- Open-source contributions. <br />- Strong sense of good engineering and architecture. <br />- Good understanding of security."

Gross and Edward Druce of Course Concierge.</p><p>Course Concierge is an online course publishing company that creates industry-leading online courses for NYT best-selling authors, TED speakers and YouTubers with millions of subscribers.</p><p>Our clients include YouTubers with 100,000,000+ views, one of the most hotly-followed health experts on Instagram, and a coach to NFL athletes, NBA players and U.S. special forces.</p><p>We’ve run over a dozen launches the past year alone, and we’re doing very well.</p><p>Check us out here: <a href='https://courseconcierge.com' rel='nofollow'>http://courseconcierge.com</a></p><p>For the right person, this is a Dream Opportunity — and dream company.</p><p>We’re one-year-old and growing, and we’re looking for a second developer to join our team of 12.</p><p><strong>If you are someone who…</strong></p><p>- Wants to excel in your career and take pride in active and stimulating work</p><p>- Is looking for a shot to prove yourself</p><p>- Gets excited at the prospect of learning a tremendous amount, with fast-paced and varied demands</p><p>- Has the ability to work within tight deadlines and juggle multiple tasks with poise</p><p>…this could be the opportunity you’ve been looking for.</p><p><strong>We’re a great company to join. Here’s why…</strong></p><p>- We’re young (just a year old) and you will be getting in at the ground level</p><p>- We have an unbelievably engaged team, with world-class people in every department (from video production to research to copywriting and design)</p><p>- Our clients are fantastic. We only take on a handful and are incredibly selective in who we work with</p><p>- We’re a remote company and you’ve the freedom to work from anywhere in the US.</p><p>- We’re going places.</p><p><strong>This position is the right fit for you if…</strong></p><p>- You are someone who completely understands how WordPress works at the code level. You have built your own custom themes/plugins and you know how to extend WordPress core.</p><p>- You understand how REST APIs work and you are comfortable consuming RESTful web services, either via the client (AJAX) or the server (PHP).</p><p>- You like finding smart and elegant solutions to coding problems, in line with WordPress coding and security best practices. Your code is clean, understandable &nbsp;and well commented.</p><p>- You have solid knowledge of PHP, MySQL, HTML, Javascript/JQuery, CSS. Experience on any kind of front-end framework (i.e. Bootstrap) or Javascript framework (React, Vue) is a plus.</p><p>- You are competent with version control systems (Git) and having experience with modern web development workflows and tools (Yarn, Gulp, Sass) is a plus.</p><p><strong>You need to…</strong></p><p>- Like a big workload and be comfortable working quickly. We like to get a lot done in a day and you will be pushed</p><p>- Welcome revisions and embrace our perfectionist tendencies (as well as our clients’)</p><p>- Help us refine our technical processes</p><p>- Be a clear and capable communicator. As a company we take writing seriously. Great English and attention to detail are essential.</p><p>- Be someone we love working with! Fit comes first, above everything else for us. If you don’t ‘spark joy’ for the team, no matter how good you are, we won’t take you.</p><p>Nearly all of our communication is written (we use Basecamp 3 and are big fans of it), but we’d like you to be comfortable getting on the occasional call too.</p><p><strong>You will be needed for the following…</strong></p><p>Throughout each project, we have five core needs for development.</p><p><strong>1. Lay the foundation</strong></p><p>Setup of a client’s domain and hosting, and integration of a payment gateway, membership plugin, affiliate plugin and email platform.</p><p>As a team, we consider ourselves ‘mixed online course artists’.</p><p>Most clients already have websites, hosting and email platforms. Whatever platforms they’re using, we need to be able to get on with them and have them work well together (minimising migrations as much as possible).</p><p>The one exception to this is we do everything on WordPress.</p><p><strong>2. Create a stunning email capture page</strong></p><p>Here are two examples from some of our clients…</p><p><a href='https://theweekendwoodworker.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://theweekendwoodworker.com/</a></p><p><a href='https://artofcoaching.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://artofcoaching.com/</a></p><p>From our design team’s PSDs, everything you create needs to be wonderfully responsive, and no stone (from the thank you page to a nicely formatted confirmation email) left unturned.</p><p><strong>3. Build a long-form sales page</strong></p><p>Our designers make sales pages that are many thousands of words digestible and enticing to read. We need you to do their work justice.</p><p><strong>4. Creation of membership area</strong></p><p>Pick a favourite WordPress membership plugin and create a layout that houses a course with clear and simple navigation.</p><p>We always look to enhance the user experience for clients’ customers and deliver the best learning environment possible.</p><p><strong>5. </strong><strong>Checkout</strong><strong> page</strong></p><p>Making sure payments are taken, membership entitlements are correct and segments are created in a newsletter platform for buyers.</p><p>You know where we can get free SSLs and best practices for security.</p><p>*</p><p>The position will start at 20-25 hours per week, with a view to becoming near enough full-time in a matter of months. Pay will be set at a competitive hourly rate, fixed.</p><p><strong>To apply…</strong></p><p>Please write to kathryn@courseconcierge.com&nbsp;with ONE example of a responsive page you have coded, along with a brief pitch on why you think you’d be a great fit.</p><p>Do not send more than one link or your entry will be disqualified.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, please do not send a resume, CV or attachment of any kind. We don’t care where you went to college (or that you even went at all) — all that matters is whether you can do it.</p><p>We won’t be able to get back to everyone, but for those who stand out, we will send a list of interview questions in writing, then, for the few we like best, set up a brief call to discuss the opportunity.</p><p>The deadline for submissions is June 10, though those who apply sooner have an advantage.</p><p>We will pick two candidates from interviews to begin a paid two-week trial (to assess on-the-job performance and cultural fit). One person will then be chosen for the ongoing role.</p><p>Thank you for reading. Best of luck, and I look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>Kathryn</p>"

You turn on your monitor and join the hangout for your daily Standup. Call done, you hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. There are some GitHub PRs you need to review, so you head there first. The rest of the morning goes by working on that feature for the weekly client demo tomorrow. Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone's day you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></strong></p><p>At nearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

You’ll be an integral part of our product and engineering teams focused on architecting and developing our client-side programming.</p><p>We’re looking for a strong track record of architecting and building products. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>*What You'll Do*<br>* Lead development on the client layer and user experience.<br>* Develop a comprehensive HTML/CSS/JS framework for rendering web applications for multiple devices and themes.<br>* Refine the application building experience that makes it a delight for our customers to use and extend Knack.<br>* Consistently improve the speed, reliability, and performance of the Knack client application.<br>* Evaluate new technologies and help determine opportunities to leverage these.<br>* Work on implementing front-end Knack features.</p><p>How you’ll do this:<br>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our small engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote.

We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>So why are we different?</p><p>We’re bootstrapped: we’ve had to build something our customers actually pay for. This changes how you do things.</p><p>We’re 100% remote: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.</p><p>We’re small: and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars-- we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.</p><p>We enjoy the journey: we’re in this for the long haul. We’re not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We’re building something we’re proud of and want to keep improving on.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*<br>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It’s not about separation, it’s about optimization.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced.

We are a small team of remote developers in India working along with the product team in NY. Dev team - 4. Overall company size - 12.</p><p>What: We’ve developed a web-based app designed to interest students and make them more successful at reading. It provides teachers with detailed analytics to drive learning intervention. We're now working on scaling the product and providing advanced features to aid student learning and empower teachers with more tools to help them see how to guide their students.</p><p>Why: We don’t do it just because it’s interesting (though it is). We do it because we’re obsessed with solving one of the most catastrophic, under-acknowledged problems in the US and the world: year after year, students graduate high school without being able to read at the level that is required for success in college and in life.</p><p>Where: New York, Bangalore &amp; other Indian cities.</p><p>Apply to us through AngelList:<a href='https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/134957-senior-ruby-engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/134957-senior-ruby-en...</a><a href='https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/348137-frontend-engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/zinclearninglabs/jobs/348137-frontend-engin...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

We are at a stage where our interest lies in finding founding team members. We will happily expose you to strategy, planning and the entire foundation of the business if and when required.</p><p>The right person is not afraid to shake things up or speak up when needed. They will stand their ground when they know they are right, and learn from it when they are wrong. </p><p>Technical skills are important, but making sure everyone in the team gets along is even more. We work in a distributed environment, so working alone, using technology for discussions and managing your own time are added challenges you will have to deal with.</p><p>Now, we also realise that these kind of people don’t just turn up out of the blue. So we are always on the lookout and are planning to grow based on people, not hire based on growth. In return, you must be committed, and anything measured in months will be considered insufficient.</p><p>Finally; if your only goal in life is to make a difference and genuinely help wineries, you really should get in touch. Otherwise, if this sounds like a means to an end, you can simply head over here: <a href='https://w.troly.io/u3is8' rel='nofollow'>https://w.troly.io/u3is8</a></p></div>"

But lawyers are terribly served by traditional recruitment agencies, who rely on anonymised web ads or inexperienced cold callers to engage potential legal recruits.<br /><br />Our founders, Tom Balmer and David Crocker, have been involved in the establishment and growth of some of the best names in the legal recruitment industry since the early noughties.  In 2017 they launched Third Way Legal, a marketplace platform designed to change the way lawyers engage with the jobs market.<br /><br />Third Way is a unique network, where lawyers can confidentially see which firms are looking for lawyers like them (in some ways it is similar to workinginstartups.com!). Following an amazing first year, where we have grown to 6 people and are annualising a million in turnover, we now are looking to build an in-house tech team.<br /><br />It's an extremely exciting time to join the business.  We are expanding into the interim market, looking to grow into new geographies, and have so many new feature ideas it hurts.  We're looking for a full-stack developer, comfortable with front and back end development, who is pragmatic and can eager to grow with the firm.  If that sounds like you, and you'd like to join us on our journey to change the legal recruitment industry, please get in touch!"

You’ll be faced with a huge variety of tasks and you’ll constantly have to learn new things as you go. You might be writing database queries one day, designing a user interface the next day, answering customer service emails the day after that, and putting together an investor pitch deck in between. You’ll develop skills that will be useful for the rest of your career and you’ll learn to deal with pressure, stress, and risk. You’ll be pushed beyond your comfort zone, which is where learning really happens. This is why many people learn more in three months at a startup than three years at a big company.<br> In a startup, all you have is a bunch of guesses about what might work in the market, and the focus is on search. It turns out that searching is a lot more fun.<br>Even the “crappy” days at a startup can be fun. The ghetto office, the need to scrape by on a budget, the constant sense that you have no idea what you’re doing can all be terrifying, but also exciting. They teach you to appreciate the small victories in life rather than becoming obsessed with promotions or politics.</p></div>"

We use the cutting-edge Elm programming language for all our new front-end code, and have been migrating legacy React code to Elm as well. Our back-end is primarily Ruby on Rails, although we are working to split off smaller services as we scale to keep up with our traffic. You can read about our experiences with these technologies on our team blog! [2]</p><p>In addition to spending work hours open-sourcing useful libraries we develop [3], we also invest financially in open source. We hired the creator of Elm, Evan Czaplicki, to develop Elm full time. [4] Evan discusses his plans for the language with the team every week, periodically pairs with other engineers on Elm, and cracks up members of the sales team with his lunchtime jokes.</p><p>We use Amazon AWS for our infrastructure and automate all of our deployments using Chef and OpsWorks. We write a lot of tests, and use Jenkins for continuous integration. Our process for new features begins with our product team and in-house visual designer, continues with a GitHub pull request from a feature branch into master, and ends with our in-house QA specialist trying to break it before it reaches production.</p><p>We’re looking for engineers who want to work on a mission that makes a difference and who are the type of collaborators that value kindness and open-mindedness, over convincing the group they’re right.</p><p>You can learn more about what to expect through blog posts about our interview process [5] and on-boarding experience [6].</p><p>If you’re interested, please apply through our jobs page! <a href='https://www.noredink.com/jobs' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/jobs</a></p><p>[1] <a href='https://www.noredink.com/about/team' rel='nofollow'>https://www.noredink.com/about/team</a></p><p>[2] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/</a></p><p>[3] <a href='https://github.com/NoRedInk/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/NoRedInk/</a></p><p>[4] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/136615783598/welcome-evan</a></p><p>[5] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-hiring-process' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/145260396603/our-engineering-h...</a></p><p>[6] <a href='http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-new-remote-engineer-think-about' rel='nofollow'>http://tech.noredink.com/post/143787279069/on-boarding-as-a-...</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

The phrase that most aptly describes us is “boutique consulting firm” as we are currently working on select software consulting projects while concurrently laying the foundation for a stand-alone product which will focus on enabling business workflows and growing workplace productivity. We are being smart in our approach balancing software consulting with our own product. We balance both to pay ourselves well and support our vision for the future. We have an excellent four person team in place with Big-4 backend experience. We're looking to get one final person in place to help us define what a modern and maintainable front-end stack should look like and to help build our product. Hopefully that's you.</p><p>Who you are: An incredibly motivated, amazingly talented full stack engineer whose abilities truly shine on the front end. You know React, Webpack, CSS, Sass, JSX, and the other standard front-end technologies we aren't as familiar with. You are a self-starter who can work with little supervision. You are meticulous about details and sufficiently passionate to get things done, yet know when to pivot to a more experimental move-fast mode. You should be a great teammate who looks to make your colleagues more productive because you know they are doing the same for you. You love the state-of-the-art and yet understand the danger of being there and can articulate the reasons why.</p><p><a href='https://www.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://www.builtforme.tech</a></p><p><a href='https://blog.builtforme.tech' rel='nofollow'>https://blog.builtforme.tech</a></p><p>Apply via AngelList: <a href='https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/' rel='nofollow'>https://angel.co/builtforme/jobs/</a><span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

    "content": "Kopernio <br />Kopernio is a research tool and software platform that simplifies access to scientific journal articles, and was founded by the previous founders of Mendeley and Newsflo. Our vision is to become the backbone for scientific communication by building the infrastructure to enable a seamless flow of academic journal articles. We are making millions of scientific journal articles available with one-click, saving 10 million researchers time and frustration when accessing scientific knowledge. We are proud to get our hands dirty to develop the core infrastructure that lets scientists shine. <br /> <br />Job description <br /><br />We are looking for a front-end engineer to join our small and highly talented team to work on our browser extension. You’ll be adding new features, improving reliability and performance of the Kopernio extension and improving the overall user experience as we grow Kopernio to millions of users. You will be working alongside product and UX, and directly with our founders, and you will play a central role in defining the future of our product and the technologies we use.  As a front-end engineer you should always work with a strong focus on end-users and build Kopernio to enable them to do their research. <br /> <br />Your primary responsibility will be the development of the Kopernio browser extension, ensuring that researchers can get seamless access to journal article across hundreds of different online platforms. <br /> <br />About you <br /><br />● You have proven expertise developing, releasing and maintaining complex Javascript (ES6) applications <br />● Ideally you have built cross-browser applications using the Web Extensions framework <br />● You build secure web applications following modern web development practices <br />● You should be comfortable with version control systems (git) <br />● Some knowledge of Python web frameworks is a plus, but not essential <br />● You value a culture where the quality of code is as important as time-to-market <br />● You have a history of building and taking products to market in fast-paced environments<br /> ● You enjoy acquiring new skills and expertise as required by the project <br />● You have a bias for simplicity, scalability, robustness and maintainability in code and systems <br />● You design architectures which allow rapid iterations whilst considering future requirements and the big picture when planning and developing new applications and features <br />● You have great team skills, including the confidence to put your idea across, even if the idea is initially unpopular, and the humility to admit when you are wrong <br /><br /> <br />Responsibilities <br /><br />● Full lifecycle (ideation, building and deploying) responsibility for the Kopernio plugin <br />● Serve as the initial point of escalation for software development issues within your area of responsibility <br />● Interface with other technical team members to finalise requirements <br /> <br /> <br />About us <br /><br />We are a team of successful entrepreneurs and engineers, having built several companies in our field that have had a major impact on science, and with Kopernio we’re doing it again. It is a true start-up where a “can-do” attitude is valued more than any process, and where we want to push boundaries by breaking things. We put a strong emphasis on working independently and creatively, trying to find solutions to complex problems in an iterative way. You will be exposed to the world of start-ups, yet we will be clear on our purpose and objectives to advance science and help scientists to become more efficient. <br /> <br />As we grow, we are committed to building cohesive teams where communication, support and innovation thrives. We expect the team to actively contribute ideas and proactively take decisions in the interest of Kopernio and our users. <br /> <br /> "

Most of the work will be focused on the back-end but front-end skills are desirable too.<br /><br />There will be plenty of discussion and debate, so if you’re looking to grow and learn, this is the place to be. I personally see this as a vital role and am excited about the prospect of someone filling the seat.<br /><br />Skills needed – minimum 5 years professional experience<br /><br />- C# .NET MVC and WebApi, EF, SimpleInjector, Visual Studio, SQL, Azure etc.<br />- Native HTML, LESS or SCSS<br />- Native JS, VueJS, Angular/AngularJS, Typescript a bonus<br />- Bootstrap 2.3 and 3 experience<br />- Git<br />- Excellent communications skills, ability to think beyond the work beyond the backlog and be a part of the overall strategy<br />- Appraisd is responsive so you’ll need to write both for desktop and mobile – although most of our users view Appraisd on their desktops.<br /><br />We can we offer you?<br /><br />We’ll pay you a great wage and you’ll work in our very friendly and attractive Kentish Town warehouse office with our small but happy and enthusiastic team. Remote work for 1-2 days per week will be considered - or if you want to go off for a week to code from a cafe in Berlin that's fine too, and why not!<br /><br />We have various perks here and there but to be honest I think what’s most important is that you can see the impact of your work, develop your skills and be inspired by others around you – and all this I can guarantee.<br /><br />To get the ball rolling, please get in touch with your CV plus examples of work you’ve done already. Please also let us know…<br /><br />– what frameworks and libraries you’ve used before or are interested in<br />– any Codepen/Github stuff you’ve done or SO profile<br />– an opinion of our website our app<br />– what is your expected salary and availability.<br /><br />To start as soon as possible at our office in Kentish Town.<br /><br />Absolutely no agencies please, we’ve had a lot of success posting jobs like this one and don’t need any help.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Roly<br />Founder<br />Appraisd<br />www.appraisd.com"

We are an online company.</span><br>        <a href='https://gmb.io/' rel='nofollow'>https://gmb.io/</a>      <br>      <a rel='nofollow'>View all GMB jobs →</a>    </h3>  </div>    </div>  <div>    <div>Hi, we’re GMB, and we teach people how to use their bodies better.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span>The word “fitness” has been perverted to mean doing things you hate to impress people you don’t like with a body that’s too tired and sore to do anything fun. We’re here to change that, and we need your help.</span><br></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>We started out in 2010 with an email subscription form, a YouTube account, and a lot of scrambling to figure things out. Even with over 40,000 clients in 80 countries, pretty much everything about how we’ve built our company and marketed our products has been bootstrapped by a small group of deeply invested people wearing a lot of hats and learning as we went along. Even with a team of over twenty people, that’s our DNA – learning and making it work.</div><div><br></div><div>This year, we’re making big changes to our product and we are looking for a Front-End WP Developer to join GMB, part-time to start. You’ll be part of a team that is helping to imagine and build new products — as well as improve existing ones.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>What will be your responsibilities?</h3></div><ul><li>Working directly with our graphic designer to bring new design to code</li><li>Update and improve existing front-end code</li><li>Potential to work on the next version of our app and be involved in styleguide and UI library creation</li></ul><div><h4>To do this job, you will need:</h4></div><ul><li>Experience bringing WordPress themes to code (HTML/CSS/JS)</li><li>Some sense or experience in UX design</li><li>Familiarity with modern front-end tools (Gulp, Sass, etc.)</li><li>Experience using git and GitHub workflows</li><li>Familiarity with CSS methodology (SMACSS, BEM, etc.)</li><li>Bonus points for some back-end and API familiarity especially with regard to WordPress</li></ul><div><h4>Other Requirements &amp; Competencies</h4></div><ul><li>You’ve been following GMB for a while and understand what sets us apart from other fitness companies.</li><li>Are clear on the value you’ll bring to the team.</li><li>Know how to follow instructions and how to be creative – and how to choose between them.</li><li>Speak and read/write perfect English.</li><li>Have a sense of humor.</li><li>Always work to develop a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset' rel='nofollow'>growth mindset</a>.</li><li>Good at self-managing.</li><li>Have a strong DIY ethic – know what you don’t know and what you can do about it.</li><li>Can make things happen. You are a doer/maker as well as a planner.</li><li>Can manage written communication with a lot of different people.</li></ul><div>Compensation is competitive and commensurate with experience, but you can get a pretty good sense of our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits and such here</a>.</div><div><br></div><div><h3>What’s it like working at GMB?</h3></div><div>GMB is a kick-ass company.</div><div><br></div><div>GMB is about creating autonomy. We’re working to make the world a better place by teaching people to take control of what their bodies can do so they can contribute to their families and communities. We create options for exploration and self-expression.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div><br></div><div>And we work the way we practice. Like our idea of fitness and the way we deliver our programs, very little about the way we work is like what you’d find in a traditional company. Here’s how we exemplify autonomy at work:</div><div><br></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;<span>Work and Live Anywhere</span></div><div><br></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;<span>Set Your Own Schedule.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span></span>&nbsp;<span>Create Your Own Role.</span></div><div><br></div><div>We also take care of our people. Building a great team with full autonomy requires more than just freedom; we thrive in an environment that supports development and growth… and we bet you will too. Some of the things we value and encourage are:&nbsp;<span>continuous learning</span>,&nbsp;<span>travel &amp; facetime</span>, as well as&nbsp;<span>time off</span>. Learn more about all our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits here</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>If you like what you’ve read so far, familiarize yourself with who we are and what we’re&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>about</a>&nbsp;before going any further. You should also listen to this interview with Andy about&nbsp;<a href='https://mixergy.com/interviews/gmb-fitness-with-andy-fossett/' rel='nofollow'>how we grew GMB</a>&nbsp;and what’s important to us.</div><div><br></div><div>Want to learn more about the smart, fun people you’ll be working with?

The ideal person will have solid HTML, CSS and JS skills and be able to craft delightful user experiences in a scalable way.<br><br>This is a position on our design team, which means you will have a big say in how we architect the design system that powers all of our app's UI and UX. With that in mind, we are looking for someone who can do more than just re-create a mockup – We're looking for someone who can think critically and help us create better experiences for our users, while working closely with our full stack developers who are creating the core business logic.<br><br><strong>The kind of work we do</strong><br>BriteCore is essentially a CMS for insurance companies. They use it to manage all aspects of their business, including tracking policies, contacts and handling claims.<br><br>This means our users typically see our app more as a business tool like Microsoft Word or Google Sheets than a website (even though it is completely a web app). They also are using BriteCore for several hours every day, and are concerned with doing things quickly and efficiently. This, along with the complicated nature of insurance, means we deal with some complex workflows, and try to set ourselves apart from our competitors with a smooth UX that helps them navigate these tough processes.<br><br><strong>What you might be doing</strong><br>We're looking for someone who can really help us take our frontend system to the next level, and this includes things like:</p><ul><li>Creating, in collaboration with designers, a modular, scalable design system that can be used by other developers to quickly and consistently build out new features.</li><li>Implementing a robust hotkey system, to allow our users to quickly accomplish tasks in the app.</li><li>Help us implement better user analytics, and eventually allow us to A/B test new features/designs.</li></ul><p><br><strong>What it is like to work here</strong><br>BriteCore is a remote-first company — even employees who live in our home city of Springfield, MO usually work from home! And most of the people you will work with are scattered across the US and the globe. This means that remote team members are just as much part of the company as local employees. We also allow a lot of flexibility in terms of time off. In return, we expect all of our employees to be productive and accountable, which means you'll work alongside a great, dedicated team.<br><br><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Work alongside designers to implement features, with a focus on great UX.&nbsp;</li><li>Have a keen sense for what makes an attractive UI</li><li>Structure and develop code in a component-driven, scalable way</li><li>Have a thorough understanding of HTML/CSS/JS best practices.</li><li>Communicate clearly</li><li>Welcome feedback and collaboration</li><li>Be friendly, confident, and patient with others</li><li>Self-direct</li><li>Stay up on industry best practices and trends</li></ul><p><br><strong>Technologies We Use</strong></p><ul><li>Vue.js (Experience with Vue, or another frontend JS framework is required)</li><li>SCSS</li><li>PostCSS</li><li>HTML5</li><li>Webpack</li><li>Github, various CLI tools</li></ul><p><br><strong>Benefits and Compensation</strong></p><ul><li>$50k-$70k based on experience and proven performance</li><li>Benefit from working alongside and observing a team of world-class engineers and designers</li><li>Comprehensive health insurance coverage including medical, dental, and vision for US-based applicants</li><li>Flexible schedule</li><li>Relaxed work environment</li><li>Remote work</li><li>Flexible learning time — explore your ideas and new technologies on the clock</li></ul>                    </div>                            <h2>                About BriteCore            </h2>            <div><p>At BriteCore, we build gorgeous, scalable, and usable cloud-based insurance software.

You turn on your monitor and join the hangout for your daily Standup. Call done, you hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. There are some GitHub PRs you need to review, so you head there first. The rest of the morning goes by working on that feature for the weekly client demo tomorrow. Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone's day you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></strong></p><p>At nearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

A company you’ve heard of before, or maybe not, but either way you’ve landed on this page because you were at least a little curious, and we like that about you. We spend our time making it easier for SMBs to talk with their customers. Today Help Scout is used by more than 8,000 businesses in 140 countries.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for someone who’s really smart, and humble, and thorough, and meticulous, and self-motivated, and kind, and a little funny, and tenacious, and did I say self-motivated? Well, that’s because we’re a remote company! Being remote is fantastic, it’s empowering, and it’s perfect for people who like to be their own boss and push themselves to be at their very best every day. It’s also perfect for people who hate wearing pants or enjoy going out for ice cream at 4:18pm because it was nice outside and they just felt like it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>That’s where you come in! If you’re a Front-end Engineer with those qualities, chances are you would love to work at Help Scout.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About you</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><ul><li>You love writing beautiful, scalable, semantic HTML and CSS. As a matter of fact, it’s what you are best at.<br></li><li>You have a love for design and are at your best partnering with designers to bring a project to life. You take Sketches and Sketch files, transform them into fully-functioning code, making sure every pixel and interaction is perfect and up to spec.<br></li><li>You love to build things that are intuitive for everyone to use, and you understand that whenever possible, code shouldn’t constrain creativity.<br></li><li>You are comfortable writing basic JavaScript from scratch, not just implementing a jQuery plugin you found online.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Your eye for animation and motion is as strong as your eye for a static design. You have a real knack for implementing these sorts of enhancements as a design comes together.<br></li><li>You’re a systems thinker, passionate about writing code that scales and stands the test of time. Most importantly, it’s code anyone can understand and enhance without asking you for help.<br></li><li>You’re always looking for new ways to stay on top of your craft as the industry evolves.&nbsp;<br></li><li>You are pretty psyched about tools like Seed and Jekyll, a couple of open source projects that power our website. We sure do like them a lot.<br></li><li>The idea of helping to move our business forward on three vectors — Growth, Content, and Brand — is really exciting and empowering to you.<br></li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div><b>About the role</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><ul><li>This role sits on the Design team, not Engineering. Although you love to code, the design/interaction side of things has always been your specialty. We believe code, animation, and interactions are just as central to the design as the pixels are.<br></li><li>You’ll be spending the majority of your time working on our marketing website, creating new pages, re-working old ones, and generally helping us create a brand experience that resonates with people so much that they want to be a customer.&nbsp;<br></li><li>Sure, you’ll be writing a lot of code. But we also need someone who can take a step back, see the bigger picture, and look to make an impact on the business as a whole, driving sales, building a beautiful brand that stands out and creates an emotional connection with people.<br></li><li>On a daily basis you’ll be collaborating with folks from Design and Growth teams, but your tasks will very widely! One day you might be building a new feature page alongside a designer. The next day you might be writing some JavaScript to improve our lightweight A/B testing framework. The next day you might be writing documentation for our style guide or creating PRs to improve Seed. You might even pitch in to create some prototypes for our product every once in a while.<br></li><li>You'll also have freedom to refactor, implement changes, or develop processes that you feel like will benefit everyone’s workflow. The work you do will help many of your teammates be at their best and work efficiently. Pretty exciting, right?<br></li><li>Since you'll be the most technical person working on the marketing site, many folks will lean on you for advice and direction. You’ll help them level up their coding skills, familiarize them with the codebase, and empower them to work more independently.<br></li><li>You'll often be responsible for driving(or co-driving) projects forward, communicating with others about tasks and milestones. Your perfectionist tendencies lead you to be quite organized, and a pleasure to work with.<br></li></ul><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Bonus points</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Our marketing site is powered by a single Jekyll instance, which has a complicated build process. It's a delicate dance between tools like Node.js, Ruby, Gulp and some other packages to optimize our website for flexibility, speed, and scale. Having experience with these sorts of environments would be tremendously helpful.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Benefits</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><ul><li>Competitive Salary - We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well. The formula we use to calculate all salaries is public to employees and is improved upon regularly.<br></li><li>Work anywhere - Work from our office in Boston or anywhere else, provided you have 4 hours of overlap with the team. We’ll even buy your home office furniture or help you pay for a co-working space.<br></li><li>Health and dental insurance - We cover you and your family's health/dental insurance 100%. If you are based in the US, we'll cover you on our Aetna policy.<br></li><li>Long-term/Short-term Disability Insurance &amp; Life Insurance - we cover 100% of the premiums for LT/ST Disability insurance and base Life Insurance. You also have the option to purchase supplementary life insurance through our provider.<br></li><li>International Benefit Stipend - If you’re based outside the US, you’ll receive a monthly stipend that goes towards covering medical insurance, long and short-term disability, and accountant costs.<br></li><li>Flexible vacation - Take time off when you need it, we trust you.<br></li><li>Paid parental leave, including adoption and foster care - 12 weeks for the primary caretaker and 4 week for the secondary caretaker.<br></li><li>401k with 1% match- 1% Retirement Plan matching for both US and International Employees<br></li><li>Personal development stipend - Up to $1,800 per year to improve your craft<br></li><li>Great tools - Each employee receives a Mac laptop and 27'' display (or equivalent). We’ll also purchase any of the software or hardware you need as well as high-end furniture to get your home office started<br></li><li>Complete transparency - Everyone has full access to business metrics and financial information about the company.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>About Us</b></div><div><br></div><div>Help Scout is made by roughly 70 people in 40+ cities around the world, all with a passion for excellence in their craft.</div><div><br></div><div>We come from diverse backgrounds and are united by an enthusiasm for great products and delightful customer experiences.</div><div><br></div><div>Since launching in April of 2011, Help Scout now powers 8,000+ support teams in over 140 countries. Our software is used and trusted by businesses of every shape and size.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Designed to go the distance</b></div><div><br></div><div>Our mission is to foster the world’s customer-centric businesses by providing tools that serve customers in the most human, helpful way. While growth is important, team and values are paramount. We’re always striving to do impactful work we’re proud of in lieu of chasing overnight success.</div><div><br></div><div><b>We’re builders without borders</b></div><div><br></div><div>Our entire team is free to work remotely from wherever they choose. We overcome remote challenges through transparency, trust, and video conferencing. The reward is worth the effort—we’ll take talent, skill, and diverse perspectives over local geography any day.</div><div><br></div><div>Above all, we want Help Scout to be a place where passionate people can do their very best work. You won’t find any ping-pong tables or kegerators here. Instead, you’ll be surrounded by driven, supportive teammates who will push you to be better. We take work/life harmony seriously, too, as we want every career at Help Scout to be a long and satisfying one.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</b></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p><a href='https://jobs.lever.co/helpscout/8be68f5f-fa11-468e-b35d-7247a4921564' rel='nofollow'>https://jobs.lever.co/helpscout/8be68f5f-fa11-468e-b35d-7247a4921564</a></p>  </div>"

You turn on your monitor and join the hangout for your daily Standup. Call done, you hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. There are some GitHub PRs you need to review, so you head there first. The rest of the morning goes by working on that feature for the weekly client demo tomorrow. Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone's day you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></strong></p><p>At nearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

The ideal person will have solid HTML, CSS and JS skills and be able to craft delightful user experiences in a scalable way.<br><br>This is a position on our design team, which means you will have a big say in how we architect the design system that powers all of our app's UI and UX. With that in mind, we are looking for someone who can do more than just re-create a mockup – We're looking for someone who can think critically and help us create better experiences for our users, while working closely with our full stack developers who are creating the core business logic.<br><br><strong>The kind of work we do</strong><br>BriteCore is essentially a CMS for insurance companies. They use it to manage all aspects of their business, including tracking policies, contacts and handling claims.<br><br>This means our users typically see our app more as a business tool like Microsoft Word or Google Sheets than a website (even though it is completely a web app). They also are using BriteCore for several hours every day, and are concerned with doing things quickly and efficiently. This, along with the complicated nature of insurance, means we deal with some complex workflows, and try to set ourselves apart from our competitors with a smooth UX that helps them navigate these tough processes.<br><br><strong>What you might be doing</strong><br>We're looking for someone who can really help us take our frontend system to the next level, and this includes things like:</p><ul><li>Creating, in collaboration with designers, a modular, scalable design system that can be used by other developers to quickly and consistently build out new features.</li><li>Implementing a robust hotkey system, to allow our users to quickly accomplish tasks in the app.</li><li>Help us implement better user analytics, and eventually allow us to A/B test new features/designs.</li></ul><p><br><strong>What it is like to work here</strong><br>BriteCore is a remote-first company — even employees who live in our home city of Springfield, MO usually work from home!

The bulk of my work is with reputable design firms so there is a very high standard WRT front-end implementation.</p><p>Project ownership depends on what we're both comfortable with, either giving you full ownership with my oversight or tag-teaming and you keep track of hours.</p><p>Ideally looking for someone in Toronto for the occasional meetup, but open to folks from other locations. Send me your resume, portfolio, and standard rate and I'll be in touch!</p><p>matt@typewriter.software<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

In a world where we live with devices that last only a few months or a few years maybe, where we buy stuff to throw it away only days or weeks later, the term ‘effort’ gains a new meaning.</p><p>Recently, I was reading <a href='https://www.kinoyoga.com/yogi-assignment-yatnah-effort/' rel='nofollow'>an essay on ‘Yatnah’</a>, ‘Effort’. I spent a lot of time outside in nature in the past weeks and created a small acre to grow some vegetables. I also attended a workshop to learn the craft of grafting fruit trees. When you cut a tree, you realize that our fast-living, short-term lifestyle is very different from how nature works. I grafted a tree that is supposed to grow for decades now, and if you cut a tree that has been there for forty years, it’ll take another forty to grow one that will be similarly tall.</p><p>I’d love that we all try to <strong>create more long-lasting work</strong>, software that works in a decade, and in order to do so, put effort into learning how we can make that happen. So long, I’ll leave you with this quote and a bunch of interesting articles.</p><blockquote>“In our modern world it can be tempting to throw effort away and replace it with a few phrases of positive thinking. But there is just no substitute for practice”.<br><br>— Kino Macgregor</blockquote>      <div>      <div>    <p>Getting the process <em>just</em> right ain't an easy task.

We all love new design tools, and new ones such as Sketch, Figma, Xd, or Invision Studio keep popping up. But despite these tools solving a lot of common problems and making some things easier, productivity is mostly about what works for your problem and not what is newest.

Finally, a better alternative to the much used Google DNS servers, it is available under <code>1.1.1.1</code>. The new DNS is the fastest, and probably one of the most secure ones, too, out there. Cloudflare put a lot of effort into encrypting the service and partnering up with Mozilla to make DNS over HTTPS work to close a big privacy gap that until now leaked all your browsing data to the DNS provider.</li><li>I heard a lot about iOS machine learning already, but despite the interesting fact that they’re able to do this on the device without sending everything to a cloud, I haven’t found out how to make use of this for apps, yet.

An amazing update that makes working with the software much faster than before, and even for me as a command line lover it’s a nice option.</li></ul><a href='https://medium.com/@codeprincess/machine-learning-in-ios-for-the-noob-6c2cdd04b00b' rel='nofollow'></a>Manu Rink shows <a href='https://medium.com/@codeprincess/machine-learning-in-ios-for-the-noob-6c2cdd04b00b' rel='nofollow'>how machine learning in iOS works</a> by building an offline handwritten text recognition.

However, advertisers have found a way to track users with HSTS and using it as a persistent cross-site identifier (known as “super cookie”). <a href='https://webkit.org/blog/8146/protecting-against-hsts-abuse/' rel='nofollow'>The WebKit developers reacted now</a>, and in order to protect the privacy of their users, they weakened the reliability of HSTS by limiting the hostname scope and ignoring an HSTS state for subresource requests to blocked domains.</li><li>PagerDuty just published an <a href='https://sudo.pagerduty.com/for_everyone/' rel='nofollow'>open-source version of their internal security training material</a>, full of interesting and easy to understand explanations about common security issues and strategies. This is especially useful as you can give it to people without technical experience.</li><li>Christoph Rumpel shares how he found <a href='https://christoph-rumpel.com/2018/03/content-security-policy-hash-algorithm-and-turbolinks' rel='nofollow'>a way to use his Content Security Policy with the Laravel Response Caching package</a>.</li><li>While Argon2 is the current best practice algorithm to use for hashing (passwords, for example), there are a couple of things developers need to prepare for. For example, <a href='https://dev.to/justyntemme/how-to-dos-yourself-with-argon2-20a4' rel='nofollow'>it’s easy to DOS yourself using Argon2</a>, so you need to rate limit queries.</li><li>James Fisher shares an interesting way to <a href='https://jameshfisher.com/2018/04/07/the-dots-do-matter-how-to-scam-a-gmail-user.html' rel='nofollow'>scam Gmail users, as demonstrated at the example of Netflix</a>.</li></ul><h4>Web Performance</h4><ul><li>This week, a discussion popped up on whether the technique of <a href='https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/compressive-images.html' rel='nofollow'>serving compressive images</a> is still a good idea. Tim Kadlec took it as a trigger to revisit it. He now concludes that <a href='https://timkadlec.com/remembers/2018-03-22-compressive-images-revisited/' rel='nofollow'>we should not use the compressive image technique anymore</a> because of its big memory footprint and rely on new responsive image technologies such as the <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element or <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> attributes instead.</li><li>Eric Portis shares the under-the-hood principles of the <code>w</code> descriptors and <code>sizes</code> attribute for images. A pretty technical but revealing post that makes you <a href='https://beta.observablehq.com/@eeeps/w-descriptors-and-sizes-under-the-hood' rel='nofollow'>finally understand the magic behind these new responsive image attributes</a>.</li><li>Tim Oxley shares <a href='http://blog.timoxley.com/post/47041269194/avoid-else-return-early' rel='nofollow'>why he prefers to return early and avoid <code>else</code></a> wherever possible. This is something I’ve been doing at the beginning of my career, then lost at some point, but returned to it again recently.

But now CSS has a proper object-based API for working with values in JavaScript: the <a href='https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/cssom' rel='nofollow'>CSS Typed Object Model</a>. It’s only available in the upcoming Chrome 66 yet but definitely a promising feature I’d love to use in my code soon.</li><li>The React.js documentation now has an extra section that explains how to easily and <a href='https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html#programmatically-managing-focus' rel='nofollow'>programmatically manage focus states to ensure your UI is accessible</a>.</li><li>James Milner shares how we can <a href='https://www.loxodrome.io/post/cancelling-requests/' rel='nofollow'>use abortable fetch to cancel requests</a>.</li><li>There are a few articles about Web Push Notifications out there already, but Oleksii Rudenko’s <a href='https://60devs.com/getting-started-with-web-push-notifications.html' rel='nofollow'>getting-started guide</a> is a great primer that explains the principles very well.</li><li>In the past years, we got a lot of new features on the JavaScript platform. And since it’s hard to remember all the new stuff, Raja Rao DV summed up <a href='https://medium.freecodecamp.org/here-are-examples-of-everything-new-in-ecmascript-2016-2017-and-2018-d52fa3b5a70e' rel='nofollow'>“Everything new in ECMAScript 2016, 2017, and 2018”</a>.</li></ul><h4>Work &amp; Life</h4><ul><li>To raise awareness for how common such situations are for all of us, James Bennett shares an embarrassing situation <a href='https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2018/mar/20/mistakes/' rel='nofollow'>where he made a simple mistake that took him a long time to find out</a>.

We’re here to change that, and we need your help.</p><p>We started out in 2010 with an email subscription form, a YouTube account, and a lot of scrambling to figure things out. Even with over 40,000 clients in 80 countries, pretty much everything about how we’ve built our company and marketed our products has been bootstrapped by a small group of deeply invested people wearing a lot of hats and learning as we went along. Even with a team of over twenty people, that’s our DNA – learning and making it work.</p><p>This year, we’re making big changes to our product and <strong>we are looking for a Front-End WP Developer to join GMB, part-time to start</strong>. You’ll be part of a team that is helping to imagine and build new products — as well as improve existing ones.</p><h2>What will be your responsibilities?</h2><ul><li>Working directly with our graphic designer to bring new design to code</li><li>Update and improve existing front-end code</li><li>Potential to work on the next version of our app and be involved in styleguide and UI library creation</li></ul><h3>To do this job, you will need:</h3><ul><li>Experience bringing WordPress themes to code (HTML/CSS/JS)</li><li>Some sense or experience in UX design</li><li>Familiarity with modern front-end tools (Gulp, Sass, etc.)</li><li>Experience using git and GitHub workflows</li><li>Familiarity with CSS methodology (SMACSS, BEM, etc.)</li><li>Bonus points for some back-end and API familiarity especially with regard to WordPress</li></ul><h3>Other Requirements &amp; Competencies</h3><ul><li>You’ve been following GMB for a while and understand what sets us apart from other fitness companies.</li><li>You are clear on the value you’ll bring to the team.</li><li>You know how to follow instructions and how to be creative – and how to choose between them.</li><li>You speak and read/write perfect English.</li><li>You have a sense of humor.</li><li>You always work to develop a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset' rel='nofollow'>growth mindset</a>.</li><li>You are good at self-managing.</li><li>You have a strong DIY ethic – know what you don’t know and what you can do about it.</li><li>You can make things happen. You are a doer/maker as well as a planner.</li><li>You can manage written communication with a lot of different people.</li></ul><p>Compensation is competitive and commensurate with experience, but you can get a pretty good sense of our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits and such here</a>.</p><h2>What’s it like working at GMB?</h2><p>GMB is a kick-ass company.</p><p>GMB is about creating autonomy. We’re working to make the world a better place by teaching people to take control of what their bodies can do so they can contribute to their families and communities. We create options for exploration and self-expression.</p><p>And we work the way we practice. Like our idea of fitness and the way we deliver our programs, very little about the way we work is like what you’d find in a traditional company. Here’s how we exemplify autonomy at work:</p><p>&nbsp;<span>Work and Live Anywhere</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Set Your Own Schedule.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Create Your Own Role.</span></p><p>We also take care of our people. Building a great team with full autonomy requires more than just freedom; we thrive in an environment that supports development and growth… and we bet you will too. Some of the things we value and encourage are:&nbsp;<span>continuous learning</span>,&nbsp;<span>travel &amp; facetime</span>, as well as&nbsp;<span>time off</span>. Learn more about all our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/hiring/' rel='nofollow'>benefits here</a>.</p><p>If you like what you’ve read so far, familiarize yourself with who we are and what we’re&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>about</a>&nbsp;before going any further. You should also listen to this interview with Andy about&nbsp;<a href='https://mixergy.com/interviews/gmb-fitness-with-andy-fossett/' rel='nofollow'>how we grew GMB</a>&nbsp;and what’s important to us.</p><p>Want to learn more about the smart, fun people you’ll be working with? Check out our&nbsp;<a href='https://gmb.io/team/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>.</p><h2>How To Apply</h2><p>If you’re thinking, “I know how to use an APP; I’d be great at this,” you’re probably wrong. Please read everything above&nbsp;<em>carefully</em>&nbsp;and make sure you understand that there are some fairly complex and technical requirements.</p><p>If that all sounds like stuff you can handle, we’d love to hear from you. Please click on the link below, fill in the form at the bottom of the page, and make a case for why you’ll be a great fit for the team.</p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>"

To accomplish this we've built out a flat organizational structure which we call the ConsenSys Mesh: a network of individuals &amp; teams working autonomously and towards the same goal.  Our mission is to use these decentralized solutions to fundamentally reshape the economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us.</p><p>About the role:<br>We are currently seeking a Design System Lead with a passion for the designer and developer experiences in the Ethereum ecosystem. Realizing a decentralized future depends on the mass adoption and use of applications built on Ethereum, so we are focused on making the experience of building an application as easy as possible—with the highest quality results.</p><p>Teams, internally and eventually externally, need a way to quickly prototype decentralized applications (dApps) and validate their ideas. As product designers across the organization learn and experiment, we need a way to aggregate best practices around interactions specific to blockchain. The Design System Lead will drive the vision and grow a team to research, build, and iterate upon a design system to serve internal teams and, in the future, the broader Ethereum community.</p><p>As the Design System Lead is responsible for the visual and technical direction of the Design System, this will require both product and project management skills, in addition to a deep understanding of design and front-end development. The ideal candidate will design a complete systems life-cycle, from establishing a practice and vision that endures to design, build, document, and maintain a library used by many product teams.</p><p>Responsibilities:<br>Lead: Lead the visual and technical direction of the experience design, visual style, and technical tooling, with input from peers from product design and development teams.<br>Build a team: Plan for and grow a design system team of front-end developers and designers.

Rapid application development allows us to adapt to our customers' needs and stay one step ahead of the competition, so we're looking for an applicant with an agile and adaptive mind.<br /><br />Our ideal candidate would be one who has as much energy for adventure sports as they do coding - you can live and work in the heart of the Alps, the UK or where you choose.<br /><br />The role:<br /><br />You will be working on a number of existing applications, and aiding with the creation of new application as and when they are needed. Our applications use middleware stacks to allow efficient re-use of encapsulated code, and the rapid development and deployment of new systems and feature sets. As a startup, we are moving at a rapid pace and the successful candidate will need to be able to get up to speed quickly and work self-sufficiently.<br /><br />In our back-end work we follow PHP-fig standards where they apply. We check our code for 'mess' and standards before sharing with remote repos and other projects. We use the git-flow branching strategy, and code review via pull-request.<br /><br />In our front-end work we build templates in Twig which can be integrated into existing and new PHP server-side projects. Developers need to have a good understanding of how data can be provided from and delivered to the back-end application, through template rendering, form submission and API interaction. They need to be able to use composition and inheritance to implement an effective, efficient templating strategy.<br /><br />Valuable experience of using JS, and JQuery where appropriate, is essential to any of our front-end work. The developer should be able to manipulate the DOM to provide an exceptional user experience, and use application logic to interact with the back end application on-page.<br /><br />Benefits:<br /><br />This role is a full time role at 38 hours per week, Monday to Friday.<br /><br />The Bikmo HQ is based in Chester, but you do not need to be. Everyone in the Bikmo team works remotely to some degree. We also have offices in Innsbruck and Munich which you are welcome to work in.<br /><br />It will be highly beneficial to spend the initial phase of your employment sitting side-by-side with our CTO Jorj, in order to get to grips with our existing systems, our roadmap, and our working expectations. This can either be done at one of our offices, or, potentially, at your work environment if it's more practical for Jorj to spend time there instead.<br /><br />As a growing business, our benefit structure is under review and will include a share options scheme and holiday entitlement boost.<br /><br />Holiday is pro rata at 28 days per year, inclusive of bank holidays. You get an additional day of leave for your birthday and may take 1 day per month for riding adventures / 12 days per year - in return for content for our magazine.<br /><br />Your application:<br /><br />Please include a bit about you/your CV of LinkedIn profile and answers to the following questions with your application;<br /><br />1. Talk about your preferred development environment: computer, software, and office.<br />2. What did you learn this week?<br />3. What is at the top of your riding (cycling, snowboarding, etc.) bucket-list?"

By working closely with them and by sharing with the community, we are building a platform that changes the rules of the industry forever. We’re building it from the ground up, using the most innovative technologies in the world.<br /><br />The end result: A change for the good whilst giving half of our net profits back to the fans.<br /><br />Our Mission<br /><br />Our mission is to disrupt a huge industry full of sleeping giants. You don’t have to be a fan of gambling (or even sport!) to join us, but you do have to be a fan of wanting to use the latest technology to change something that we believe is fundamentally flawed. If you have a passion for all things technical and love the idea of working on groundbreaking and exciting tech projects, we’re right up your street.<br /><br />So who are we?<br />* A multitalented talented, international, cross-functional team spread out right across the globe!<br />* A well funded company, with investment and backing from key industry leaders from both the world of sport and gaming<br />* A truly collaborative environment, working across multiple projects together making great things<br />* Autonomy and trust, take ownership and control of your own work<br />* Working on a highly respected concept – “Too good to be true” said some of football’s leading players and contributors who are now on board and taking the first steps of this exciting journey with us!<br /><br />What are we looking for?<br />We’re looking for talented engineers to help us build great things. We’re cross-functional, managing both B2B and B2C components across multiple exciting projects within the Rush group, so it’s important to us you work well in a collaborative environment.<br /><br />See the opportunity - you’ll be a key team member so we expect you to step up and help shape the team as we grow.<br />Make your voice heard - collaboration and the ability to express ideas is key. Decisions are made based on the best ideas, not who came up with them no matter if it’s you’re first day or you’ve been with us a while.<br />Be a self-starter – we’re a startup and so you should be self-motivated, have energy, drive and be ready to make the difference.<br />Think critically - with a strong ability to solve problems and collaborate on ideas, you’ll help influence our technical direction.<br /><br />A depth of knowledge – you’ve been there and done it. You know your stuff and that’s what makes you a crucial, go-to member of the team.<br /><br />Flexible approach - an open mind and ability to adapt. While sharing your own knowledge and experience, you’re still keen to learn from the experiences of others too.<br /><br />Ok, sounds good. So what would I be doing?<br /><br />Great question!
