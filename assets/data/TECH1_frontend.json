But we're always looking for ways to improve. People rarely work more than 40 hrs/wk and we spend&nbsp;0% of our time fighting fires.</p><p>There's no babysitting. You're in charge of yourself. That means you work where and when you want.</p><p>Culture is really important to us. But building culture in a remote team can be difficult. We do a lot of things to try to remedy that. Chief among them are our annual retreats. Last year our retreat was in Lisbon, Portugal. We had a hackathon, broke out of escape rooms, and ate lots of good food.</p><p>There's always something challenging to work and great people to spend your days with building things at Hubstaff.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible schedule</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote / Work from home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Job security / Long term</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

    "content": "<h3>Humbly Confident Full Stack Developer</h3><div><p><strong><strong>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</strong></strong></p><p>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;, or read some of our&nbsp;, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in!&nbsp;We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;<em>click</em>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</p><p>But&nbsp;first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></strong></p><p>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.</p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s&nbsp;<em>external</em>&nbsp;competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.</p><p><strong><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named&nbsp;) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></strong></p><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></strong></p><p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done, a&nbsp;&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on&nbsp;. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong><strong>Up Your Game</strong></strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re International...</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;<em>and your family.</em>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;<em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;<em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>You will change lives.</em></p><p><strong><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</strong></strong></p><p>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).</p><p>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.</p><p>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).</p><p>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:</p><ul><li>“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”</li><li>“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd&nbsp;party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”</li><li>We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?</li><li>“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”</li></ul><p><strong><strong>You’re our person if you:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.</li><li>Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Integrating with 3rd&nbsp;party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.</li><li>Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.</li><li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.</li><li>Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.</li><li>Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.</li><li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.</li><li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.</li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p></p><ul><li>Apply below (<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>here</a>) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on&nbsp;<strong>June 30th, 2019</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Firm. It’s a real deadline.</li></ul><ul><li>First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:</li><li>You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</li><ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and&nbsp;<strong>why you would be a great fit for the position</strong>. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).</li><li>Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)</li><li>Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.</li><li>Includes answers to the following questions:</li><ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them?</li><li>Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position,&nbsp;what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>Complete this short coding test (<a href='https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb' rel='nofollow'>https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb</a>) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.</li></ul></ul></ul><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

    "content": "<span><h2>Humbly Confident Full Stack Developer</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>You Need a Budget</h3></span> <div>  <div>   <br>About Us and Why We’re Hiring   <br>   <br>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;Google us, or read some of our&nbsp;reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.   <br>   <br>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.   <br>   <br>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our&nbsp;web app&nbsp;and&nbsp;API. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in!&nbsp;We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original&nbsp;Cultural Manifesto&nbsp;has to really&nbsp;click&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!   <br>   <br>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side&nbsp;really&nbsp;well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.   <br>   <br>But&nbsp;first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.   <br>   <br>Who you’d be working with:   <br>   <br>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.   <br>   <br>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s&nbsp;external&nbsp;competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.   <br>   <br>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.   <br>   <br>How You’ll Work at YNAB   <br>   <br>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named&nbsp;Fortune’s #2 Best Small Company to Work For) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:   <br>   <br>Live Where You Want   <br>   <br>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.   <br>   <br>No Crazy Hours   <br>   <br>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.   <br>   <br>Take Vacation (Seriously)   <br>   <br>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;minimum&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.   <br>   <br>The YNAB Retreat   <br>   <br>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done&nbsp;Costa Rica, a&nbsp;gigantic cabin&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on&nbsp;Laguna Beach. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.   <br>   <br>Up Your Game   <br>   <br>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.   <br>   <br>If You’re International...   <br>   <br>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.   <br>   <br>If You’re Stateside…   <br>   <br>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;and your family.&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)   <br>   <br>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;your retirement&nbsp;nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)   <br>   <br>Other Tidbits   <br>   <br>   <br>* Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)   <br>   <br>* The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.   <br>   <br>* We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.   <br>   <br>* We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;standing?) in front of a computer.   <br>   <br>* We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.   <br>   <br>* Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will change lives.   <br>   <br>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer   <br>   <br>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).   <br>   <br>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.   <br>   <br>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).   <br>   <br>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:   <br>   <br>   <br>* “How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”   <br>   <br>* “We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd&nbsp;party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”   <br>   <br>* We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?   <br>   <br>* “We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>You’re our person if you:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.   <br>   <br>* Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.   <br>   <br>* Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.   <br>   <br>* Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)   <br>   <br>* Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.   <br>   <br>* Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.   <br>   <br>* Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Integrating with 3rd&nbsp;party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.   <br>   <br>* Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.   <br>   <br>* Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.   <br>   <br>* Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.   <br>   <br>* Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.   <br>   <br>* Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.   <br>   <br>* Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for&nbsp;all&nbsp;employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.   <br>   <br>How to Apply   <br>   <br>   <br>* Apply below (here) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on&nbsp;June 30th, 2019.&nbsp;Firm. It’s a real deadline.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:   <br>   <br>* You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and&nbsp;why you would be a great fit for the position. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).   <br>   <br>* Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)   <br>   <br>* Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.   <br>   <br>* Includes answers to the following questions:   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them?   <br>   <br>* Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.   <br>   <br>* If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position,&nbsp;what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?   <br>   <br>* Complete this short coding test (https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We look forward to hearing from you!   <br>   <br>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!  </div> </div>",

If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</p><p>But&nbsp;first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></strong></p><p>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.</p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s&nbsp;<em>external</em>&nbsp;competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.</p><p><strong><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience (we’ve even been named&nbsp;<a href='http://fortune.com/best-small-workplaces/' rel='nofollow'>Fortune’s #2 Best Small Company to Work For</a>) and have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></strong></p><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></strong></p><p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;Costa Rica</a>, a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on&nbsp;<a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'>Laguna Beach</a>. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong><strong>Up Your Game</strong></strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re International...</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;<em>and your family.</em>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;<em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;<em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>You will change lives.</em></p><p><strong><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</strong></strong></p><p>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).</p><p>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.</p><p>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).</p><p>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:</p><ul><li>“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”</li><li>“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd&nbsp;party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”</li><li>We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?</li><li>“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”</li></ul><p><strong><strong>You’re our person if you:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.</li><li>Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Integrating with 3rd&nbsp;party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.</li><li>Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.</li><li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.</li><li>Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.</li><li>Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.</li><li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.</li><li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.</li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p><strong><strong>How to Apply</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Apply below (<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>here</a>) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on&nbsp;<strong>June 30th, 2019</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Firm. It’s a real deadline.</li></ul><ul><li>First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:</li><li>You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</li><ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and&nbsp;<strong>why you would be a great fit for the position</strong>. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).</li><li>Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)</li><li>Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.</li><li>Includes answers to the following questions:</li><ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them?</li><li>Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position,&nbsp;what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>Complete this short coding test (<a href='https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb' rel='nofollow'>https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb</a>) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.</li></ul></ul></ul><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Paid-for Health Insurance (your family too!)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Minimum (paid) vacation policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>3% automatic 401k contribution</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Amazing work-life balance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Paid sick days</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Live where you want - Remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Profit-based bonus</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p><p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</p><p>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p><ul><li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li><li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li><li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li><li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li><li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li><li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li><li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li></ul><p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p><p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p><p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p><p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Analytics Fire</h3>            <div><p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p><p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

I’d like to tell you about a position we have on our team.</p><p>This role is entitled Software Engineer III. In this senior engineering role you will build really cool products customers can’t stop talking about. Better yet, you will be working with an amazing team of motivated, smart, yet humble teammates.</p><p>At its core, this role is so much more than building software applications. Instead, this is a role about creating the future, fueling our growth, and building things people love.</p><p></p><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong><p>Our company,&nbsp;TakeLessons, is used by millions of consumers and instructors each month to find and book education services and take online classes. We have two products: first, a matching marketplace where customers can find and book their perfect instructor – both in-person (locally) and online. Second, an online group class product called&nbsp;TakeLessons Live&nbsp;where customers can access live language and music classes from wherever they are, on any device, and get the help they need.</p><p>From the first time a person signs up to become a member or downloads our app, we want to give them an incredible learning experience. Our Software Engineer III is a critical member of the team who ensures we deliver a delightful and wow experience during their journey with TakeLessons.</p><p>It’s a fast-paced agile environment that gives you the opportunity to work on challenging problems alongside talented individuals that value teamwork, user empathy, flexibility, and quality software solutions.</p><p>Your day will consist of mission critical tasks, decisions, and direction that help shape our user experience. You may find yourself working on things like:</p><ul></ul><li>Developing highly maintainable and scalable systems, working on all levels of the software stack with languages including, but not limited to PHP, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc.</li><li>Contributing to each phase in the product development process from ideation to software design, database modeling, implementation, testing, and maintenance.</li><li>Working closely with our PM and UX design team to help define new features using data analytics, customer feedback, and interviews.</li><li>You’ll lead some development projects and will provide assistance to others when needed.</li><li>Find, debug, and address defects in existing software.</li><li>Building and maintaining third party integrations.</li><p></p><strong>Why should you work with us?</strong><p>We’re&nbsp;TakeLessons&nbsp;and our mission is to inspire the world to connect and grow so that we empower people to live more meaningful lives. To do this, we’ve created a top education site for lifelong learning.</p><p>You’ll get to own our web platform and mobile app experiences and find new ways to deliver value to customers. We’re seeing usage continue to ramp, customer feedback scores improving and we’re thinking about how to scale like crazy. There’s so much opportunity to make a difference here!</p><p>The people we work with are open-minded and focused on ways we can improve. If we find a cool new tool or service that will really benefit the company, let’s use it! If you come up with a new idea or a better way to do something, let’s talk about it! We have a fun and smart group that loves to figure out creative and efficient ways to get things done.</p><p>What’s really super cool for me (I think you’ll like it, too) is that we get to help instructors make a better living doing what they love. We all know how hard it is for teachers to make money, but with TakeLessons, they can teach their passion&nbsp;and&nbsp;get paid doing it!

We currently have over 290 clients based throughout the UK and Ireland. These clients are a mixture of Theatres, Arts, Festivals and speciality offerings such as Ice Skating and Christmas attractions. We are a consistently profitable company with a healthy year on year growth. The new features and abilities we are adding to Ticketsolve put us in an excellent place to deliver strong growth in the coming years.   <br>   <br># Introduction   <br>We are currently going through an exciting evolution of our platform. We are moving from a traditional RoR architecture to a modern &quot;single page application&quot;, exposing our application as a set of API's consumed by Ember to provide a rich interactive experience.   <br>   <br>We have migrated our customer-facing ticket selling application to Ember and our ticket scanning application to Ember, with great success. We are currently working on rebuilding the backend of our platform with the immediate focus been on our &quot;Point of Sale&quot;. We are now looking to add to our team to accelerate the creation and rollout of this change across the remainder of our platform. This covers the CRM, reporting/analytics and configurations aspects of our backend.   <br>   <br>Over the last few months, we have grown the front end, Ember team. We are now looking to expand our server team with new people to cover Ruby and Ruby on Rails server development. Ideally, this person will have RoR experience. In terms of experience, we are open to both junior and experienced developers - the main requirement is talent and enthusiasm.   <br>   <br># How we work   <br>We run a lightweight process that focuses on feature-based delivery on a weekly basis. Our coordination and communication are mostly through daily 'catch-up meetings' and use of appropriate tools such as Trello for backlog management, Slack for communication and Git(GitHub) for source control and feature deployment through PRs and Milestones.   <br>   <br>From a coding perspective, we place a strong emphasis on clean, minimal, well-refactored code backed up by a robust suite of automated tests. We make use of peer review for all design and development work.   <br>   <br>In general, we strive for an approach that empowers and trusts individuals to 'do the right thing', and as a team, we try and keep each other true to this.   <br>   <br># Remote working   <br>Our development team works as a remote team with members in Berlin, Malmö, Barcelona, Singapore and Taiwan. Our wider organisation has people based in United Kingdom and Dublin. Dublin is our headquarters and main office space - with core Support team and Sales and Marketing team.   <br>   <br>Remote working has become part of our company DNA. We believe that it offers a lot of advantages to both Ticketsolve and employees. This means that you should be comfortable working as part of a remote team. If this is new to you, don't worry, it was for us at the beginning as well. We now have lots of experience helping people settle in - so keep an open mind and imagine a working day with no daily commute!   <br>   <br>Important to note that timezones are a consideration for us with remote working. Our experience is that European and Asian time zones are preferable, as it allows for collaboration at reasonable times.   <br>   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br># Skills &amp; Requirements   <br>- 2+ years experience developing web applications   <br>- Experience with programming Ruby/Rails required with the role focused on server development   <br>- Understanding of front-end technologies: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, SASS, Ember preferred, but not required   <br>- Experience with Chef and Terraform a bonus   <br>- Strong programming skills with a focus on clean design, well-refactored code and automated testing   <br>- Comfortable working as part of a remote team   <br>   <br># Technologies we use   <br>- Ruby on Rails is our primary server framework evolving towards pure API server   <br>- Ember is our primary front end development framework   <br>- JSONAPI::Resources, http://jsonapi-resources.com/, is how we are building our API's   <br>- MySQL / Redis / Elastic are our primary storage engines   <br>- All our servers are Ubuntu based managed through CHEF   <br>- Deployed on AWS using terraform for managing infrastructure   <br>- GitHub for source code management and process support   <br>- Travis for continuous integration   <br>   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- European and Asian time zones are preferable   <br>  </div> </div>",

People would have a path to a fulfilling future, instead of being buried under debt. Employers would benefit from a workforce trained for today. And education could finally offer students a return on their investment of both money and time.&nbsp;Students enroll in Thinkful courses to gain the valuable technical and professional skills needed to take them from curious learners to employed technologists. As a Course Mentor, you will support students by acting as an advisor, counselor, and support system as they complete the course and land their first industry job.

We are moving from a traditional RoR architecture to a modern &quot;single page application&quot;, exposing our application as a set of API's consumed by Ember to provide a rich interactive experience.</div><div><br></div><div>We have migrated our customer-facing ticket selling application to Ember and our ticket scanning application to Ember, with great success. We are currently working on rebuilding the backend of our platform with the immediate focus been on our &quot;Point of Sale&quot;. We are now looking to add to our team to accelerate the creation and rollout of this change across the remainder of our platform. This covers the CRM, reporting/analytics and configurations aspects of our backend.</div><div><br></div><div>Over the last few months, we have grown the front end, Ember team. We are now looking to expand our server team with new people to cover Ruby and Ruby on Rails server development. Ideally, this person will have RoR experience. In terms of experience, we are open to both junior and experienced developers - the main requirement is talent and enthusiasm.</div><div><br></div><div><b># Skills &amp; Requirements</b></div><div>- 2+ years experience developing web applications</div><div>- Experience with programming Ruby/Rails required with the role focused on server development</div><div>- Understanding of front-end technologies: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, SASS, Ember preferred, but not required&nbsp;</div><div>- Experience with Chef and Terraform a bonus</div><div>- Strong programming skills with a focus on clean design, well-refactored code and automated testing&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>- Comfortable working as part of a remote team&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b># Technologies we use</b></div><div>- Ruby on Rails is our primary server framework evolving towards pure API server</div><div>- Ember is our primary front end development framework</div><div>- JSONAPI::Resources, http://jsonapi-resources.com/, is how we are building our API's</div><div>- MySQL / Redis / Elastic are our primary storage engines</div><div>- All our servers are Ubuntu based managed through CHEF</div><div>- Deployed on AWS using terraform for managing infrastructure</div><div>- GitHub for source code management and process support</div><div>- Travis for continuous integration</div><div><br></div><div><b># How we work</b></div><div>We run a lightweight process that focuses on feature-based delivery on a weekly basis. Our coordination and communication are mostly through daily 'catch-up meetings' and use of appropriate tools such as Trello for backlog management, Slack for communication and Git(GitHub) for source control and feature deployment through PRs and Milestones.</div><div><br></div><div>From a coding perspective, we place a strong emphasis on clean, minimal, well-refactored code backed up by a robust suite of automated tests. We make use of peer review for all design and development work.</div><div><br></div><div>In general, we strive for an approach that empowers and trusts individuals to 'do the right thing', and as a team, we try and keep each other true to this.</div><div><br></div><div><b># Remote working</b></div><div>Our development team works as a remote team with members in Berlin, Malmö, Barcelona, Singapore and Taiwan. Our wider organisation has people based in United Kingdom and Dublin. Dublin is our headquarters and main office space - with core Support team and Sales and Marketing team.</div><div><br></div><div>Remote working has become part of our company DNA. We believe that it offers a lot of advantages to both Ticketsolve and employees. This means that you should be comfortable working as part of a remote team. If this is new to you, don't worry, it was for us at the beginning as well. We now have lots of experience helping people settle in - so keep an open mind and imagine a working day with no daily commute!</div><div><br></div><div>Important to note that timezones are a consideration for us with remote working. Our experience is that European and Asian time zones are preferable, as it allows for collaboration at reasonable times.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b># Recruitment process</b></div><div>We are initially looking for resumes and portfolio examples of your work, e.g. GitHub repositories, blog articles, etc. If you do not have anything suitable, we can provide a problem piece to work together on. Please submit resumes to shanly@ticketsolve.com with the subject &quot;Job Application&quot;. Please note that due to the volume of applications we will not respond to all applications, but instead make contact when there is a potential fit.</div><div><br></div><div>From there, we filter down and do a series of remote interviews. These are usually 'work' focused, i.e. looking at code together, pair programming, for example. Our preference is for candidates to talk to as much of the team as possible so that we, team and candidate, can make the best decision possible. If appropriate and makes sense, we will also look at facilitating face to face meetings as well.</div><div><br></div><div>After this stage, we will be in a position to make a formal offer.</div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more Programming jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Roger.ai </span><br><span>Senior Frontend Engineer (React)</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>America &amp; Europe</span></a></li><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Aha!</span><br><span>senior ruby on rails software engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>North America</span></a></li><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Grafana Labs </span><br><span>Web Developer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>East Coast US or European timezone</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

Generally, consumer frontends are written in React/ES6, and backends in Typescript (Express for REST APIs and native websockets for RTC). We use Redis as a message broker and Postgres as a persistent datastore. Our infrastructure is (mostly) on AWS.   <br>   <br>The most visually-prominent consumer product is the Koji IDE, a web-based editor that connects to a remote development server and enables full-stack development from any device with a browser. The remote development server uses Docker to create a per-project environment that runs both the editor server (file writes, PTY operations, OT-based real-time collaboration, Git operations, etc.) and the processes/servers required for the user to develop their project (backend servers, frontend dev servers, test runners, etc).   <br>   <br>At a high level, the web editor’s frontend uses VSCode’s Monaco as a text editor and a custom parser that renders Koji-compliant JSON config files into intuitive visual controls. Because Koji projects are simply modern, standards-compliant Javascript projects (or projects that ultimately target JS), this hybrid approach gives our users the benefits of easy, visual configuration using no-code patterns for manipulating project-level config (strings, colors, styles, mechanics, settings, etc.) without subjecting them to the usual restrictions of no-code/low-code platforms (complex, unintuitive controls; ballooning trees/graphs once projects go beyond simple basics; no ability to drop down and edit native code; etc.).   <br>   <br>Because Koji projects are staged in the cloud during development, the web editor’s live preview can be opened on any internet-connected device (without the need for ngrok, mobile device proxies, etc.). The editor provides some additional tools for easily testing backend routes and manipulating PTYs.   <br>   <br>Koji projects are backend by Git repositories. By default, new projects use a Git remote hosted by Koji’s Git server, but projects can also use repositories hosted by third-parties as their remotes. The Koji deploy pipeline uses Git hooks to trigger new builds (build steps are defined by a JSON file within the project) and shows build progress, logs, and notifications inside the web editor. Projects can deploy static bundles or dynamic services that are compiled, containerized, and deployed using Google’s Cloud Run.   <br>   <br>Once a project is deployed, it can be accessed by an auto-generated subdomain. From within the editor, users can also register a custom subdomain on one of our root domains (e.g., myproject.withkoji.com), or register a custom domain name and configure DNS to point that domain to our CDN. We take care of HTTPS provisioning, deployment, and renewal automatically with Let’s Encrypt, and all projects are accelerated with our CDN partner, Fastly.   <br>   <br>The CDN that serves deployed projects can also inject plugins at runtime based on path/pattern matching, which lets users easily enable features like Open Graph tags (something that is typically difficult to do on client-side SPAs without SSR or services like Prerender) or integrate things like Google Analytics. The web editor also renders server access logs for deployed projects, giving users an easy way to understand traffic and growth without the need for any third-party analytics/tracking tools.  </div> </div>",

Generally, consumer frontends are written in React/ES6, and backends in Typescript (Express for REST APIs and native websockets for RTC). We use Redis as a message broker and Postgres as a persistent datastore. Our infrastructure is (mostly) on AWS.</p><p>The most visually-prominent consumer product is the Koji IDE, a web-based editor that connects to a remote development server and enables full-stack development from any device with a browser. The remote development server uses Docker to create a per-project environment that runs both the editor server (file writes, PTY operations, OT-based real-time collaboration, Git operations, etc.) and the processes/servers required for the user to develop their project (backend servers, frontend dev servers, test runners, etc).</p><p>At a high level, the web editor’s frontend uses VSCode’s Monaco as a text editor and a custom parser that renders Koji-compliant JSON config files into intuitive visual controls. Because Koji projects are simply modern, standards-compliant Javascript projects (or projects that ultimately target JS), this hybrid approach gives our users the benefits of easy, visual configuration using no-code patterns for manipulating project-level config (strings, colors, styles, mechanics, settings, etc.) without subjecting them to the usual restrictions of no-code/low-code platforms (complex, unintuitive controls; ballooning trees/graphs once projects go beyond simple basics; no ability to drop down and edit native code; etc.).</p><p>Because Koji projects are staged in the cloud during development, the web editor’s live preview can be opened on any internet-connected device (without the need for ngrok, mobile device proxies, etc.). The editor provides some additional tools for easily testing backend routes and manipulating PTYs.</p><p>Koji projects are backend by Git repositories. By default, new projects use a Git remote hosted by Koji’s Git server, but projects can also use repositories hosted by third-parties as their remotes. The Koji deploy pipeline uses Git hooks to trigger new builds (build steps are defined by a JSON file within the project) and shows build progress, logs, and notifications inside the web editor. Projects can deploy static bundles or dynamic services that are compiled, containerized, and deployed using Google’s Cloud Run.</p><p>Once a project is deployed, it can be accessed by an auto-generated subdomain. From within the editor, users can also register a custom subdomain on one of our root domains (e.g., myproject.withkoji.com), or register a custom domain name and configure DNS to point that domain to our CDN. We take care of HTTPS provisioning, deployment, and renewal automatically with Let’s Encrypt, and all projects are accelerated with our CDN partner, Fastly.</p><p>The CDN that serves deployed projects can also inject plugins at runtime based on path/pattern matching, which lets users easily enable features like Open Graph tags (something that is typically difficult to do on client-side SPAs without SSR or services like Prerender) or integrate things like Google Analytics. The web editor also renders server access logs for deployed projects, giving users an easy way to understand traffic and growth without the need for any third-party analytics/tracking tools.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/274458?reset=False&amp;ra=1u2LPuASibTO&amp;oqs=a%3D1u2LPuASibTO' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h3>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p><p>While we’ve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p><p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p><ul><li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li><li>Working on interesting technical problems that haven’t been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li><li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li><li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li><li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li></ul><p>…you should reach out.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Any computer / tech you want</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We’re working to make the world a better place by teaching people to take control of what their bodies can do so they can contribute to their families and communities. We create options for exploration and self-expression.<br><br>And we work the way we practice. It’s different, but the results speak for themselves.<br><br>If any of this is news to you, please <a href='https://gmb.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>familiarize yourself with who we are and what we’re about</a> before going any further. You should also <a href='https://mixergy.com/interviews/gmb-fitness-with-andy-fossett/' rel='nofollow'>listen to this interview with Andy about how we grew GMB</a> and what’s important to us.<br><br>If you’re clear on who we are and what we’re about, let’s get to what it’s like to work with GMB.</p><h3>About the job</h3><p>You’ll be working on the next generation of the GMB platform with a primary focus—at least initially—on front-end. To do so, you’ll be collaborating not only with two other developers but with the wider product team, marketing, and support teams as well.</p><p><br>A typical week may involve working with the following technologies so be sure that you are experienced and comfortable with…</p><ul><li><strong>HTML5, CSS</strong>, SCSS, Webpack and JavaScript</li><li><strong>RESTful API</strong>: solid grasp of API-based UI design.</li><li><strong>React</strong> (or other JS UI library, e.g. Vue or Angular)</li><li><strong>NPM</strong></li></ul><p>Other useful experience…</p><ul><li>HTML5 video API and JS video players</li><li>Flow.js or Typescript</li><li>UI &amp; UX design</li><li>React app speed optimization</li></ul><ul><li><strong>AWS Infrastructure</strong>: Route 53, CloudFront for video streaming and front-end delivery, ElasticLoad Balancer for scalability, and CloudWatch to monitor</li><li><strong>Node.js App</strong> (on AWS): ElasticBeanstalk/EC2 as a compute engine, RDS as a database, ElastiCache for real-time session storage, S3 for file storage and video streaming, and SNS as a mail/notification scheduler</li><li>Git/GitHub, WordPress/PHP, Discourse, SendGrid, DigitalOcean, Sentry, Postman</li></ul><h3>Who are you?</h3><p>You’ve been—ideally—following GMB for a while and understand what sets us apart from other fitness companies. If not, you at least have a sense of where we fit into the wider world of fitness and physical culture, because it’s very important to us that our user experience supports our mission of helping people develop the physical skills and autonomy to perform well in their chosen activities.</p><p><br>That might sound like BS, but we’re and education company, so we have to be deliberate about how each interaction contributes to our clients’ growth. <br><br>You should be clear on the value you’ll bring to the team and always working to develop a <a href='https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset' rel='nofollow'>growth mindset</a>. You have a strong DIY ethic – know what you don’t know and what you can do about it.</p><p><br>Along with a high degree autonomy comes a high degree of accountability and you flourish in that environment. You can self-manage effectively and can balance between doing and planning—you know how and when to choose between following instructions and being creative.</p><p><br>You can manage written communication with a lot of different people—speak, read, and write perfect English. And you have a damn good sense of humor accompanied by a hefty measure of irreverence.</p><h3>Pay &amp; Benefits</h3><p>Building a great team with full autonomy requires more than just freedom; we thrive in an environment that supports development and growth… and we bet you will too.</p><p><br><strong>Continuous Learning</strong></p><p>We regularly send team members to seminars to learn and every member of the team gets a Kindle and free access to any book they want to read about anything.</p><p><br><strong>Technology</strong></p><p>Since we operate online, it’s important for everyone on the team to have access to computers and other relevant technology. Count on GMB to provide any software, computers, or equipment you need.</p><p><br><strong>Travel &amp; Facetime</strong></p><p>Several times a year, we get the parts of the team together to work and play in person. You’ll get a chance to visit new places and hang with some great people, and it’s all on us.</p><p><br><strong>Time Off</strong></p><p>Beyond just making your own schedule, it’s important to take time away from work periodically. So in addition to “at will” days off, we make sure everyone takes a week away at least twice a year.<br><br>We also take care of a lot of other little (and not so little) things, and we’re open to exploring more ways to make life better for our team. In other words, these benefits are only the tip of the iceberg, and things are getting better all the time.</p><h3>How to apply</h3><p>Smoke signal. Kidding.</p><p>Apply through our online form <em>only</em>.</p><p>Please use your cover letter to…</p><ul><li>share some of your recent work and any challenges that you had to overcome</li><li>tell us what inspires you about the fitness&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;tech space</li><li>give us an example of a website or app you think is stellar</li><li>tell us a joke (the more inappropriate the better)</li></ul><p>Please do not submit generalized cover letters—they will be met with fire. Instead, tell us why you want&nbsp;<em>this specific job at GMB</em>.</p><p>We will be accepting applications until&nbsp;<span>July 1st</span>. Expect to hear from us after that date.</p><p></p>  </div>",

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.   <br>   <br>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;build a business&nbsp;not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.   <br>   <br>See how our clients&nbsp;talk&nbsp;about&nbsp;our approach&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;recognition we've received&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;holiday gifts&nbsp;each year. Or, if you're a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;Seaworthy, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!   <br>   <br>A Day In The Life   <br>   <br>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;team&nbsp;week&nbsp;recaps&nbsp;and&nbsp;years in review&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!   <br>   <br>What Does Success Look Like?   <br>   <br>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.   <br>   <br>After this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;Welcome aboard!   <br>   <br>Ongoing Support   <br>   <br>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Individual quarterly goal progress   <br>   <br>* Project status / team issues / weekly retro   <br>   <br>* Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Quarterly and Annual Reviews   <br>   <br>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We're here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.   <br>   <br>Experience and Results At Every Level   <br>   <br>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019.

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.</p><p>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;<em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.</p><p>See how our clients&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we've received</a>&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/holiday-collaboration-with-velodrome-coffee/' rel='nofollow'>holiday gifts</a>&nbsp;each year. Or, if you're a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/seaworthy/' rel='nofollow'>Seaworthy</a>, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!</p><p><strong><strong>A Day In The Life</strong></strong></p><p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p><p><strong><strong>What Does Success Look Like?</strong></strong></p><p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p><p>After this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<strong><em>Welcome aboard!</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing Support</strong></p><p>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:</p><ul><li>Individual quarterly goal progress</li><li>Project status / team issues / weekly retro</li><li>Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire</li></ul><p><strong>Quarterly and Annual Reviews</strong></p><p>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We're here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.</p><p><strong><strong>Experience and Results At Every Level</strong></strong></p><p>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019.

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop.

We have more than enough work to do so you’ll never be bored and there is plenty of room to influence the approach we take in solving these difficult problems. We currently have a team of six brilliant engineers who balance principles and pragmatism, and work hard to refine their craft. We have ambitious goals and want to grow with people that can bring new ideas to the table.

The experiences they publish work consistently across all browsers and devices, and all customer engagement is tracked with extensive analytics. All without writing code.</p><p><strong>About the Product</strong></p><p>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</p><p>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</p><p>We’re not language zealots.

We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15 Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</strong></p><p><strong>As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves:</strong></p><ul><li>writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying),</li><li>having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,</li><li>carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,</li><li>agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,</li><li>collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,</li><li>and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.</li></ul><p><strong>Key things to know</strong></p><ul><li><strong>This is a remote role</strong></li><li>We want you to start ASAP</li><li><strong>This is a full-time position</strong></li><li>Benefits</li><li>Competitive salary</li><li>Stock options</li><li>Premium health insurance</li><li>Commuter benefits</li><li>Generous PTO policy</li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us.

    "content": "<h3>Humbly Confident Full Stack Developer</h3><div><p><strong>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</strong></p><p>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. , or , and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </p><p>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our  and . All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in! We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original  has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! </p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side really well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</p><p>But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </p><p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p><p>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. </p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. </p><p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Live Where You Want</strong>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done , a  in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on . We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong>If You’re International...</strong>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. </p><p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. You will change lives. </p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer</strong> </p><p>You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).</p><p>You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.</p><p>Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).</p><p>You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:</p><ul><li>“How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”</li><li>“We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”</li><li>We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?</li><li>“We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”</li></ul><p><strong>You’re our person if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.</li><li>Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).</li></ul><p><strong>Some things you might be working on at YNAB:</strong></p><ul><li>Integrating with 3rd party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.</li><li>Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.</li><li>Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.</li><li>Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.</li><li>Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.</li><li>Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.</li><li>Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.</li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p> </p><ul><li>Apply <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5' rel='nofollow'>here</a> by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on <strong>June 30th, 2019</strong>. Firm. It’s a real deadline.</li><li>First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:</li><li>You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</li><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and <strong>why you would be a great fit for the position</strong>. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).</li><li>Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)</li><li>Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.</li><li>Includes answers to the following questions:</li><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them? </li><li>Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>Complete this short coding test (https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.</li></ul><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p><p>P.S. If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

In doing so, we add some color &amp; make the world a more interesting place!</p><p><strong>Our Frontend story </strong></p><p>When the site grew exponentially so did the need for properly structured Frontend. A major effort was spent modernizing our stack and properly structuring it so that it is scalable, maintainable and predictable. It has a nice balance in that we can iterate fast but still be confident on features/changes that we release. It is an ongoing process, so we constantly look into new ideas and ways on how to improve our stack every day.</p><p><strong>Here’s Arek, one of our Engineers:</strong></p><p><em>“I always wanted to have a job where it’s not only about coming to work because “I have to”, but also because I enjoy it and find it purposeful. Having so many talented people around and a direct impact on the experience of millions of our users - I can surely say that it’s finally possible! All of that in a fast-paced environment with a top-notch stack: React, TypeScript and the world of microservices.”</em></p><p><strong> So what's the job</strong></p><p>Working in a high traffic environment you will have the opportunity to build new features to grow the business and measure the impact. We are highly data-driven so A/B experimentation is at our core. You will be part of the frontend guild which is distributed across multiple teams consisting of a Product Owner, UX designer, backend and other frontend developers.</p><p>You will also work with the frontend guild on constantly maintaining and improving our infrastructure to keep the stack being scalable, maintainable and predictable. We are open to new and fresh ideas and you will have the opportunity to display them at our guild meetings where we openly discuss them.</p><p><strong>How we roll - Our Stack</strong></p><p>On most of the codebase, you will be working with TypeScript (our primary choice for writing Frontend code), React, Redux. Our code is built with Webpack. The code architecture is based on the Feature pattern and we are testing our code using Jest. For static content, we use Rails with Haml. We style our code using SCSS with the BEM methodology. The stack and architecture that we have right now has been chosen by many frontend developers spending a lot of time in our codebase. We think it works really well for us, but as with everything we are always up for new ideas.</p><p>We still have some parts of the code which are in our outdated stack. We are continuously working on migrating those to the preferred one. You'll move in sync with You will be part of one of the product teams. Given their domain (Search &amp; Discovery, Payments, Onboarding etc.) you will work closely with all of the team members in sharing your expertise by explaining how/if things should be done and how will it affect the user experience.</p><p><strong>A little about you</strong></p><p>It's likely that you know how to explain a problem and a solution, both in detail to a technical crowd and in a simplified way to the not so technical folk. You know how to organize your time to be efficient without being overworked, and are calm and collected when a problem arises in production, and are great at prioritising your work. In addition, you have a proven track record in the following:</p><ul><li>JavaScript and/or TypeScript - we can bring you up to speed with TypeScript</li><li>Experience with React or Vue is preferred Redux or any other state management tool</li><li>Styling while using the BEM methodology or any of the modern approaches with using PostCSS for CSSinJS, CSS modules etc.</li><li>Functional and Object-oriented programming paradigms Unit testing Build automation, webpack/rollup</li></ul><p></p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

    "content": "**About Us and Why We’re Hiring**We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. [Google us](https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab), or [read some of our reviews on the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8), and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our [web app](https://app.youneedabudget.com/users/authentication) and [API](https://api.youneedabudget.com/). All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in! We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original [Cultural Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit) has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side really well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. **Who you’d be working with:**Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. **How You’ll Work at YNAB**We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:**Live Where You Want**We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.**No Crazy Hours**We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.**Take Vacation (Seriously)**We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.**The YNAB Retreat**We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done [Costa Rica](https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343), a [gigantic cabin](https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/) in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on [Laguna Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be). We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.**Up Your Game**We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.**If You’re International...**You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. **If You’re Stateside…**You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)**Other Tidbits**- Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) - The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. - We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.- We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.- We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.- Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.  You will change lives. **Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer** You’re a Full Stack developer with at least 5 years of experience shipping, monitoring, and maintaining SaaS apps at scale (not just websites). You’re an expert in at least one modern server-side framework (Rails, ASP.NET, Express, Django, etc).You’re not necessarily the “Ops” person where you work, but you certainly understand the infrastructure well enough to aid in architecting and maintaining scalable solutions. We host on Heroku, so experience there is a bonus, but experience with AWS or other popular IAAS/PAAS is just fine.Some client-side experience is required as well, meaning you know enough HTML/CSS/some-client-side-framework to get stuff on the screen matching a designer’s spec. We work in small, cross-functional teams where you will likely find yourself responsible for implementation on both the back-end (Rails and Postgres), as well as the front-end (using Ember or Vue and written in TypeScript).You’ll help vet and improve our server-side layer, implement new features, integrate with third party API’s, and shepherd our application. We might have conversations that start like this:- “How can we be certain that our application is going to scale as we grow? How did the other apps you worked on handle similar load conditions?”- “We want to expose these parts of the API to 3rd party developers. Will that API need to differ from our internal API, and if so, how?”- We want to make it possible for users to sort their transactions in a new way, and we are thinking of using drag-and-drop to make that possible. What changes on our client and server will be necessary to accomplish this?- “We need to integrate a new data aggregation partner to connect bank accounts and import transactions. How do we set it up so that we can reuse most of that work if we bring on another partner later?”**You’re our person if you:**- Are an excellent developer that can adapt to new languages quickly.- Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.- Have plenty of war stories to tell about the last time you launched a big SaaS application, or weathered a massive spike in load, or recovered from an outage.- Know your way around SQL and relational databases. If the database layer turns out to be the culprit behind an issue, it’s not a black box to you. (Experience with Postgres is a bonus.)- Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.- Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.- Already use and love YNAB. (Not a requirement - we’ll give you “bonus points” for this one).**Some things you might be working on at YNAB:**- Integrating with 3rd party APIs like Aggregation Providers, Payment Gateways, and Analytics Services.- Profiling our most common API calls using tools like pganalyze or Sumo Logic and acting on the information to reduce response times.- Helping improve our public and private APIs to make them easier for external and internal developers to use.- Working with our external database and security consultants to make sure we haven’t missed anything.- Installing monitoring tools like Rollbar to help us detect client-side and server-side issues.- Writing automated tests for new features or improving our existing test suites.- Submitting and reviewing PRs in GitHub, collaborating in Basecamp, and jumping on a Slack call to get an extra pair of eyes on a gnarly bug.YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.**How to Apply** - Apply [here](https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9o5) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on **June 30th, 2019**. Firm. It’s a real deadline.- First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:- You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:- Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and **why you would be a great fit for the position**.

(But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a><span>, or read some of our </span><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8' rel='nofollow'><span>reviews on the app store</span></a><span>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have some big plans for our entire app ecosystem, including our </span><a href='https://app.youneedabudget.com' rel='nofollow'><span>web app</span></a><span> and </span><a href='https://api.youneedabudget.com/' rel='nofollow'><span>API</span></a><span>. All of those plans will necessitate changes on our back-end that runs on Rails/Postgres and our front-end Ember app that’s written in TypeScript. That’s where you come in! </span><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original&nbsp;</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'><span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span>&nbsp;(</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit' rel='nofollow'>https://bit.ly/2DAv83H</a>) has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</div><div><br></div><div><span>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of “full stack” professional web application development experience, which for us means you know the server-side </span><em>really</em><span> well, and have some client-side experience to go along with it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>But </span><span>first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h2>Who you'd be working with:</h2></div><div><span>Our developer team is 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s </span><em>external</em><span> competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h2>How You'll Work at YNAB</h2></div><div><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Live Where You Want</span></h4></div><div><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p><p>Our Client Team is now on the lookout for a Senior Frontend Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>The Client Domain is all about innovation. Here we shape our products to satisfy the needs of our heterogeneous customer base. To achieve this you will collaborate closely with the Backend Engineers of the Client Services Team to design the most optimal APIs to be used in our client applications.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of this team, you will play a key role in the development of our web and mobile applications for both, end users (i.e. players) and internal users (i.e. back office users). Building these from the ground up offers a great opportunity for you to take important decisions with regards to our architecture and workflows.</p><p>You will be tasked to find the right technology to solve the challenges we face, take responsibility for the implementation, and share your knowledge with your peers.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €50k-70k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li><p>5+ years experience in developing complex web and mobile applications with JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Working experience with at least one statically typed flavour of JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Solid experience with at least one main frontend framework</p></li><li><p>Good knowledge of HTML and CSS standards</p></li><li><p>Proficient user of a modern development toolchain: linters, package managers, bundlers, Git, continuous integration pipelines</p></li><li><p>Familiarity with automated testing frameworks</p></li><li><p>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</p></li><li><p>Interest in taking full ownership of your applications and managing them in a production environment including the troubleshooting of live incidents</p></li><li><p>Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build</p></li><li><p>Highly process driven and eager to learn</p></li><li><p>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</p></li><li><p>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</p></li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/senior-frontend-engineer/c/new?source=Stack%20Overflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p><p>Our Betting Team is now on the lookout for an experienced Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>The Betting Team is tasked with the provisioning of all services relating to the lifecycle of bets in our sports betting platform. This stretches from bet placement to bet settlement, including advanced features such as an event- and player-based risk management, ability to build complex bets such as from outcomes with dependent probabilities, or continuous calculation of early settlement offers (cash out).</p><p>Sub-second latency is welcomed but high throughput has higher priority in the Betting domain. The goal is building a sports betting platform where no bet is rejected due to lack of capacity in the system. Bet settlement is worth a special mention as the platform needs to be able to quickly evaluate hundreds of thousands of bets upon the resulting of an underlying sporting event.</p><p>You will be working on developing these services primarily in Go and have a voice in the architectural decisions surrounding them.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €55k-75k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li><p>BS degree in Computer Science or a similar technical field</p></li><li><p>2+ years of professional software development experience using Go</p></li><li><p>Interest in or previous experience with Elixir will be considered an asset</p></li><li><p>Experience building large-scale distributed systems, communicating asynchronously via message passing using RabbitMQ or Kafka</p></li><li><p>Deep understanding of DDD, CQRS, microservices architecture, and SQL/NoSQL data stores</p></li><li><p>Interest in unit testing and test automation, and continuous integration/deployment</p></li><li><p>Good understanding of DevOps concepts such as containerization, cloud computing, security and networking</p></li><li><p>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</p></li><li><p>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</p></li><li><p>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</p></li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/software-engineer-go-st-julians/c/new?source=Stack%20Overflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

    "content": "**Job Description**Analytics Fire builds custom software for the solar power industry. We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:- Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular- Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js- Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT- Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS- Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc- Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc- Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKitThis is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.**Skills &amp; Requirements**Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.**About Analytics Fire**Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”",

We’re passionate about helping companies transform their static digital content into engaging experiences. From custom interactive microcontent, to immersive event microsites, you can build it with Ceros. Publish and update live content instantly, and embed it into your site instantly. Join us in ending the endless creation of static content and be part of the movement towards meaningful content experiences.</p><p>We are well-funded and venture-backed by prominent investors including Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.</p><p><strong>About the Product</strong></p><p>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</p><p>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</p><p>We’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Docker, Jenkins, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</p><p><strong>About the Team</strong></p><p>As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.</p><p>We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it’s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO’s atrocious spelling.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>Working completely from home, you’ll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing. We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15” Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</p><p>As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves:</p><ul><li>writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying),</li><li>having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,</li><li>carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,</li><li>agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,</li><li>collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,</li><li>and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Things to Know</strong></p><ul><li>This is a remote role</li><li>We want you to start ASAP</li><li>This is a full-time position</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive salary</li><li>Unlimited vacation days</li><li>Stock options</li><li>Premium health insurance</li><li>Excellent gear (15” Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us.

We work in small project-based teams on our various components, and we have dedicated (and good!) project managers who help give us plenty of time and space to focus on programming. </p></h3><h3>Location</h3><h3><p>We're looking for someone in Bristol to join the team working in our Old Market office. Some flexibility of working location is available, but the majority of your time will be based with the team in Bristol.

This means putting data and the power of AI in the hands of people, not just organisations. We strongly believe that the data economy needs rebalancing. Personal data should not just be harvested and re-sold. Digital citizens should have control and be able to form trusted data relationships with brands, which will lead to stronger customer relationships.<br /><br />CitizenMe has an iOS and Android app where people can start to collect data about themselves and get value from it. In November 2017 we launched our self-service client portal, the CitizenMe Exchange, which allows organisations to request users of the CitizenMe app to exchange data for marketing, research, and digital strategy purposes.<br /><br />Job Description<br />The CitizenMe team is looking for a colleague who can lead the development effort across our web applications.

We acknowledge that systemic inequities impact student access to opportunities and that in order to ensure educational equity for all students, we must center on the experiences of those from marginalized communities to guide our work. We work to deepen our understanding of how race, class, power and privilege influence the education system as well as influence our own perspectives. To do so,&nbsp; we provide ongoing learning opportunities through org-wide professional development, affinity groups, working groups, and resource sharing.</p><p>Individuals who join ANet have the opportunity to be part of a dynamic, values driven, and team-oriented organization that is committed to having impact in schools by investing in each other and learning together.&nbsp;We were named for the third year in a row as The NonProfit Times' “Best Nonprofits to Work For” and work tirelessly to foster a working environment where the unique perspectives, backgrounds, and identities of our staff members are valued.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.   <br>   <br>Our Client Services Team is now on the lookout for a Senior Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.   <br>   <br>The Team   <br>   <br>The Client Domain is all about innovation. Here we shape our products to satisfy the needs of our heterogeneous customer base. To achieve this you will collaborate closely with the Frontend Engineers of the Client Team to design and implement bespoke APIs and services that will be used by our different products and brands.   <br>   <br>The Client Services Team is tasked with the development of all backend services required by our client applications, i.e. primarily the &nbsp;API Gateway of our platform but also client-related services such as authentication, internationalisation or content management and other backend services that allow us to provide a unique experience to a specific segment of our users. Being our platform’s gateway to the outside world, scalability and responsiveness is of utmost importance in the Client Domain. It is worth noting that the traffic pattern of our platform will not only be dictated by the sporting calendar but also by the sometimes unpredictable behaviour of our users.   <br>   <br>By joining our team you will be working primarily in Elixir but you will also influence the full lifecycle of our software, starting with architectural and design decisions, all the way to the implementation, testing and monitoring of the resulting services.   <br>   <br>Remote Work   <br>   <br>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.   <br>   <br>Compensation   <br>   <br>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €65k-90k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;perks&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>5+ years experience in developing complex web and mobile applications with JavaScript   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Working experience with at least one statically typed flavour of JavaScript   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Solid experience with at least one main frontend framework   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Good knowledge of HTML and CSS standards   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Proficient user of a modern development toolchain: linters, package managers, bundlers, Git, continuous integration pipelines   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Familiarity with automated testing frameworks   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Interest in taking full ownership of your applications and managing them in a production environment including the troubleshooting of live incidents   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Highly process driven and eager to learn   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Good communication skills in verbal and written English   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  </div> </div>",

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.   <br>   <br>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;build a business&nbsp;not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.   <br>   <br>See how our clients&nbsp;talk&nbsp;about&nbsp;our approach&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;recognition we've received&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;holiday gifts&nbsp;each year. Or, if you're a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;Seaworthy, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!   <br>   <br>A Day In The Life   <br>   <br>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;team&nbsp;week&nbsp;recaps&nbsp;and&nbsp;years in review&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!   <br>   <br>What Does Success Look Like?   <br>   <br>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.   <br>   <br>You'll have dedicated pairing time scheduled with various colleagues to cover different skills, and we'll even participate in several mock client meetings so your first standup or sprint planning meeting doesn't carry with it the weight of your first client interaction. After this training period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;Welcome aboard!   <br>   <br>Ongoing Support   <br>   <br>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Individual quarterly goal progress   <br>   <br>* Project status / team issues / weekly retro   <br>   <br>* Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Quarterly and Annual Reviews   <br>   <br>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p><p>Our Offer Team is now on the lookout for an experienced Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>The Offer Team is responsible for ensuring that the users of our Sportsbook platform are presented with relevant and fairly priced betting opportunities year-round and around the clock. The main deliverable of the team is a superpowered stream of betting opportunities, which is the result of:</p><ul><li><p>Aggregating information from third-party data sources</p></li><li><p>Implementing in-house statistical models to derive exotic betting opportunities from more simple ones</p></li><li><p>Implementing in-house pricing models to assist in offering ideal prices: attractive for end-users while also commercially viable for bookmakers</p></li><li><p>Determining the suitability of different types of betting opportunities in different jurisdictions and for different brands</p></li></ul><p>The nature of the data handled by the team requires us to obey strict SLAs around the propagation times for any kind of update.

They would also be eager to learn, grow, and foster healthy working relationships.&nbsp; If you have experience building production web applications and are as passionate about helping customers as you are about working with new technologies, then we want to talk!</p><p><strong><u>What We Require</u></strong></p><p><strong>Do you love to work directly with customers to solve business problems?</strong></p><p>We believe great software is discovered by understanding the core problems our clients are facing – and that is best achieved through frequent and direct communication with the subject matter experts. We provide leadership to support and guide interactions, but we need you to be comfortable talking with clients, discussing problems, and proposing solutions, which may not always be more software.</p><p><strong>Do you have experience writing production web applications?</strong></p><p>We strive to support our team's growth, learning, and taking on new roles at the edge of our comfort zones. At the same time, our clients expect us to bring a certain level of expertise. If you have never worked on a production web application, it is unlikely you will succeed here, even if you have other types of engineering experience.</p><p><strong>Are you able to work remotely, within +/- 2 hours of US Eastern time zone?</strong></p><p>We all mostly work from home. This requires the ability to self-direct and communicate well in writing. It also offers tremendous freedom and power, which comes with, uh, tremendous responsibility. We currently require our team to be within a 2hr time zone difference of Richmond, VA and physically based in the United States.</p><p><strong><u>Bonus Points</u></strong></p><ul><li>Being within easy driving distance of Richmond or Charlottesville is a huge plus!</li><li>Experience with:</li><ul><li>Open source web development platforms (Rails, Django, Node.js)</li><li>Writing tests and using automated testing frameworks</li><li>Modern HTML/CSS (nothing crazy, we have a design team)</li><li>JavaScript and front-end JavaScript frameworks</li><li>Linux/Infrastructure/DevOps</li><li>AWS/cloud architectures</li><li>Mobile-first development, iOS/Android, React Native, etc.</li></ul></ul><p><strong><u>What We Offer</u></strong></p><ul><li>A Great Team - Our team of engineers and designers is the best part of working here. We only hire people who are fantastic teammates – competent and smart, sure, but also humble, positive, and generous.</li><li>Great Clients - We work with mostly small and medium clients, for whom our projects make a huge impact. We prioritize clients who are pleasant and good to work with, people who share our values of transparency and empathy.</li><li>Work From Home - We are a distributed company. Everyone works from home, though the leadership team all live in central Virginia.</li><li>Negligible Travel - In general, we don't travel routinely for projects. If this is a specific concern, we're happy to discuss.</li><li>Flexible Work Schedule - We require a certain amount of overlap with the rest of the team, but if you have a predictable schedule, we can probably support it, e.g., ending at 3:30 every day or being out every Friday morning.</li><li>Good Work Life Balance (really) - We ask our team to work 40 hours a week*. That's all: a good, productive 40 hours. And then we try our best to leave you alone off the clock. We do this in part because that's how we want to live but also because we want our team to be recharged and ready to do their best when working. *If you need to work fewer than 40 hours, that might be possible too; let’s talk.</li><li>Competitive Compensation - We offer highly competitive salary and benefits, including generous time off, 401k, FSA, medical and dental insurance.</li></ul><p></p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

We recently won a Financial Times Innovative Lawyers Award and we’re only just getting started!</p> <h4><strong>About the role</strong></h4><p>We are looking for a full stack developer to help us build the future of Legal Tech (and to learn some best development practices along the way.)</p><p>We use <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> on the back-end and <strong>ES6 and Vue.js</strong> on the front end. We also use a number of other technologies including <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> for super-fast search, <strong>Redis</strong> for caching, and even a tiny bit of <strong>Python</strong> for pdf generation. The front end is designed using <strong>Haml</strong> and <strong>Sass</strong> with some <strong>Bootstrap 4</strong> thrown in for good measure.</p><p>We use <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fguides.github.com%2Fintroduction%2Fflow%2F' rel='nofollow'>Github flow</a> as our code commit and review process, <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fcodeclimate.com%2F' rel='nofollow'>CodeClimate</a> to keep our code clean, and <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fcircleci.com%2F' rel='nofollow'>CircleCI</a> to make sure our tests pass before deploying to production.</p><p>We put <strong>growth at the centre of the company</strong> and believe it’s part of everybody’s job at Lexoo. We work quickly to design, build and test new concepts to push the needle and ensure we’re providing value to customers.</p><p>You'll be working closely with Chris (CTO and Co-founder), three other developers (two of who work remotely), and our two product managers (who are based in the London office).

    "content": "We are a small business with a difference: we are backed by some of the largest VC and family office funds in the world and we work with some of the biggest companies to unleash the potential of data.<br /><br />We don’t really know what it means to be Scotland’s “most exciting” or “fastest-growing” start-up as we have no way to measure ourselves like that. What we do know is we love coming to work, our customers can’t get enough of what we do and we have the potential to change the way global businesses gain disruptive insight from data.<br /><br />We are a team of like-minded people who enjoy working hard and spending time together, both at work and socially. We are now scaling up our team to meet customer demand and are looking for talented individuals to join us.<br /><br />*The type of person we're looking for:*<br /><br />Experience has taught us that you can achieve exponentially more with less if you have the right people. We like people who dare to be different – who like solving difficult problems and who have the ambition to reach their full potential (whatever that means to them).<br /><br />We don’t really care how many years’ experience you have; it’s what you can do that matters, not how long you have been doing it. We reward our people based on the value they bring to the company and whilst it is difficult to tell, we think we offer the best reward package around. Did we mention the unlimited holidays and free stuff we all get?<br /><br />*The type of things you'll be doing*<br /><br />You will be part of a small team doing exciting things with data and business intelligence.<br /><br />You won’t be bored, nor micro-managed. You will be working with the best tools, practices and technology available. The tech stack is young, so you still have the opportunity to influence the development of a clean and modern ES6, React and Python 3 codebase.<br /><br />We love everything Agile and you will have the scope to craft your role and learn new things. We have a dedicated in-house UX/UI design team that are reinventing the way business interacts with data so you will always have modern and fresh designs to bring to life.<br /><br />From day one, your opinion matters; we value talent and we want you to have a voice in the company. We will be counting on you to bring your ideas and challenge the way things are done. We don’t believe in hierarchical management structures; every team member brings something to the table. You will be working in a great location just off Charlotte Square in central Edinburgh (although we’re happy for you to work from home when you need to).<br /><br />*What we can offer you*<br /><br />We understand that it is not just about money; we believe it is a combination of things that our people value about our rewards:<br /><br />* Uncapped holiday allowance (although we expect you to take at least 30 days!) – we work hard. If we need a break, then we need a break.<br />* Flexible working – as long as the work gets done we don’t mind where it gets done.<br />* Competitive salary – we have checked, and we pay the best!<br />* Free stuff – we want to look after you and make sure work is a fun place to be.<br />* Space to grow – we encourage projects or interests outside work; they are an important part of our creativity and drive to succeed in life, so we do what we can to help encourage these.<br />* Conference budget - want to attend a relevant event or conference? We can cover that.<br />* Training and personal development budget - we’re happy to help you develop your skills and knowledge. If we can’t teach you here, we’ll find the people who can.<br />* Parties – yes, we know how to do that as well.<br /><br />Something not on the list? Great, just let us know! That’s the beauty of joining at this stage: you get to shape the company of the future.<br /><br />*What you can offer us*<br /><br />* Passion for what you do and a willingness to learn new technologies.<br />* Commercial experience building cutting-edge responsive websites using frameworks like React and Angular.<br />* Impressive skills in: JavaScript and SASS CSS skills.<br />* An understanding of architectural and design best practices and how to make flexible and scalable software that never fails.<br />* A genuinely perfectionist attitude to development, tempered by just enough pragmatism.<br />* Experience with REST APIs.<br />* Working knowledge of Git, Mercurial or other distributed version control.<br /><br />*What would really float our boat*<br /><br />* Experience with heavy data-driven applications.<br />* Familiarity with Redux.<br />* Familiarity with styled components.<br />* Being able to demonstrate where you have done something different that you are proud of and demonstrates your creativity.<br /><br />*Diversity*<br /><br />We like to think big. Brainnwave is no place for the small minded. We celebrate individuality, uniqueness and diversity.<br /><br />Everyone's personalities, experiences, backgrounds, perspectives and ideas have a huge impact on our culture and the products we build. We’re proud to be an employer where all of our staff can benefit from equal access to professional development and bring their entire personality to work.",

Scale, reliability, and innovation keep us learning on daily basis. You will join our server-side team to enhance and maintain our server-side Java 8 and Kotlin applications.   <br>   <br>We have distributed systems hosted in AWS, which are presented to our users through an AngularJS frontend.   <br>   <br>Moving forward, the biggest challenge we face is scaling our systems to work with large data-sets and high system load. You’ll help us build systems that can easily scale up and down the number of processing nodes as needed and implement rate-limiting to ensure rogue systems don’t impact our SLAs for other applications.   <br>   <br>Additionally, you’ll improve the performance of our main data store by adding or changing indexes as appropriate, add caching functionality where possible and set up monitoring to catch performance bottlenecks early on.   <br>   <br>Culture and Work Environment   <br>   <br>As a fully remote team, communication is extremely important - there is no chance to drop in on interesting discussions around the water cooler or to see if someone is busy just by glancing at their desk. We have systems to signal busy-ness; regular meetings and stand-ups to disseminate information, frequent one-on-ones to ensure there are no frustrations building up, a code of conduct and a formal complaint process to resolve conflicts early-on.   <br>   <br>As a key member of our server-side team, you’ll specifically be expected to:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Design and build API endpoints for our internal and public APIs   <br>   <br>* Architect efficient task scheduling and processing systems   <br>   <br>* Keep up-to-date on new AWS features and integrate them into our tech stack if appropriate   <br>   <br>* Work closely with the VP of Engineering to adapt and develop our architecture and systems   <br>   <br>* Implement monitoring systems for performance bottlenecks on our main data store   <br>   <br>* Determine through performance profiling where to add caching to our distributed systems and internal interfaces   <br>   <br>* Monitor the growth of our data-sets and assist in creating strategies to address the systems where growth could become an issue   <br>   <br>* Write effective high-quality code with a focus on performance and maintainability   <br>   <br>* Create reliable tests and work closely with our QA team for end-to-end testing   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Requirements:   <br>   <br>   <br>* You thrive in a self-directed and open work environment. There’s no boss breathing down your neck, no deadlines, no fixed work hours and no in-office requirements. It’s&nbsp;really important&nbsp;that you can manage your time well, and you know what you need in order to do your job well (e.g. what work hours to pick so you have enough time to communicate with team members effectively)   <br>   <br>* Deep knowledge of the OOP paradigm, experience with functional programming and other approaches is a plus   <br>   <br>* Experience building complex systems with many moving parts, such as different protocols, varying restrictions on latency or CAP parameters   <br>   <br>* Experience building and maintaining CI/CD systems is a bonus   <br>   <br>* Excellent knowledge of static type systems and compiled languages   <br>   <br>* Deep knowledge of various data stores such as SQL, document stores, key-value stores or queuing systems, as well as their performance characteristics and scalability issues   <br>   <br>* Good understanding of caching and cache invalidation strategies   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Interested?   <br>   <br>Lasso’s vision is to be the technology hub for new home sales in North America by providing a unique combination of remarkable software and expert services. To achieve our vision we need great developers. That’s why we’ve created a great work environment, encouraging self-direction, personal development, and teamwork.   <br>&nbsp;   <br>   <br>Lasso is based in Richmond, BC, Canada.

With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~33 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.   <br>   <br>Our app’s frontend is a single-page JavaScript web app mostly written in React (originally built with Backbone.js). We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Enzyme and Mocha run via Puppeteer. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using BEM methodology and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC.   <br>   <br>We care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi Freehand wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Sketch/Abstract and code.   <br>   <br>Our frontend app is built on top of our REST API &amp; GraphQL endpoints. Our backend tech stack consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. We run our services in Docker on AWS.   <br>   <br>We ❤ open source – using dozens of open source projects with contributions to many of them, and released some of our own like [Microphone Recorder to Mp3](https://github.com/closeio/mic-recorder-to-mp3), [filevalidator.js,](https://github.com/closeio/filevalidator.js) [addresscompiler](https://github.com/closeio/addresscompiler), [backbone.mousetrap](https://github.com/closeio/backbone.mousetrap) and more at [Close Github](https://github.com/closeio).   <br>   <br>**ABOUT YOU**   <br>   <br>We're looking for an experienced full-time Frontend Software Engineer to join our engineering team.

You have significant experience with REST APIs and thoroughly understand HTTP requests. You have experience participating in code reviews and providing overall code quality suggestions to help maintain the structure and quality of the codebase.   <br>   <br>You should have great product sense and be able to think through user experience issues before diving into the code, and you exhibit a love for great UI.   <br>   <br>You’re comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with a small and talented team where you're supported in your efforts to grow professionally.

We are a fully distributed team with people working all around the world. You will have the flexibility and freedom to work in the environment of your choosing, whether that be at home, a cafe or co-working space. We're looking for a senior engineer to help build our API-First core app using JavaScript/AngularJS/React and Scala/Play.   <br>   <br>ABOUT YOU   <br>   <br>You love code. You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).   <br>   <br>You love great UX. You spend most of your time coding, but you also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, you care about more than just the code.   <br>   <br>You love learning new things. You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Scala, CSS, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it.   <br>   <br>You can balance lots of concerns. Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.   <br>   <br>You love helping others. You love sharing knowledge with the rest of your team, building shared tooling for other engineers, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers.   <br>   <br>WHAT YOU’LL DO   <br>   <br>   <br>* Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to planning our migration to React, implementing Redux best practices, and transitioning code to TypeScript.   <br>   <br>* Build reusable React components, migrate AngularJS components to React, manage data on the client with Redux, and test everything with Jasmine.   <br>   <br>* Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or custom tooling.   <br>   <br>* Refactor or improve existing code. We're planning to migrate our frontend to React, but we still have a lot of AngularJS code to clean up. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code.   <br>   <br>* Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.   <br>   <br>* Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality.   <br>   <br>* Review code written by other team members or other teams.   <br>   <br>* Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>WHAT YOU’LL BRING   <br>   <br>   <br>* 5+ years of software development experience   <br>   <br>* Experience with building and maintaining a SaaS product at scale   <br>   <br>* An affinity for creating software that is extensible, performant, and easy to read   <br>   <br>* A degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field   <br>   <br>   <br>  </div> </div>",

There’s lots of research that suggests people often don’t apply because of so-called “requirements” in a job description. If you’re an experienced React engineer with some commercial experience in either Ruby on Rails or Elixir + Phoenix, we’d like to hear from you!*   <br>   <br>**What you’re getting yourself in for**   <br>   <br>Our mission is to build the world’s best part time job. We spend our time thinking about how to give a global workforce complete control of their own work life while automating the hundreds of thousands of man hours which would normally be required to manage people on this scale.   <br>   <br>We do this using React &amp; Typescript on the frontend backed up by GraphQL servers, some written in Ruby and Rails and some in Elixir and Phoenix.   <br>   <br>Businesses ranging from the largest high-street retailers to five star hotels and independent coffee boutiques rely on Catapult as their casual workforce. If you’ve spent time in a large UK city, you’ve probably been served by a Catapult waiter or sales assistant without even realising it!   <br>   <br>We’re well funded by some amazing investors, our product is live in over 100 locations across the UK and we’ve recently launched in Berlin making us the first and only pan-european player in this space.   <br>   <br>Our company values https://writing.joincatapult.com/our-values/ are really important to us and influence every facet of how we work together.   <br>   <br>**About the role**   <br>   <br>We’ve been growing rapidly over the last three years and as we continue our international roll out, we’re looking for ambitious engineers to help us build the future of work. Our engineering principles https://writing.joincatapult.com/engineering-principles/ give a good feel for how we work together and what we value.   <br>   <br>We’re a distributed, remote first engineering organisation with team members in Prague, Warsaw, London, Bristol and Bangkok. We work in autonomous pods, each of which has ownership of one area of our business. We’re open to remote applicants from anywhere within the EU.   <br>   <br>**Benefits**   <br>   <br>As well as being a part of a well funded startup at one of the most exciting phases of it’s growth, you’ll get:   <br>   <br>* Competitive salary + stock options + 25 days paid holiday per year   <br>* A strong approach to professional development and mentorship, everyone has a dedicated L&amp;D budget for books, training and the like   <br>* Several product retreats per year where the whole team goes on a team retreat, looks back on how we can improve and then spends a week or so hacking on new ideas and exploring new technologies   <br>* Regular social events &amp; the opportunity to travel to our other offices   <br>* Company Macbook Pro which you’re free to take home   <br>* A flexible work environment focussed on output not hours   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> **Things we’ve been working on recently**   <br>   <br>No two days are ever the same in a startup, but to give you a flavour of what we’ve been up to recently:   <br>   <br>* Standardising on React, Typescript and GraphQL across our suite of applications   <br>* Using Kubernetes to automatically deploy standalone environments for our feature branches, complete with anonymised production data   <br>* Applying machine learning to the billions of data points we generate each year to completely obsolete the interview process   <br>* Preparing the entire Rails, Phoenix, React and React Native environment for Globalization   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>**About You**   <br>   <br>* Your real passion is for the front end, finding ways to deliver innovative, polished user experiences and you’re experienced supporting this by working in either Ruby &amp; Rails or Elixir &amp; Phoenix backends   <br>* You’re excited about the potential technologies like GraphQL and Typescript have to speed up and improve the process of building complex client side applications   <br>* You really buy into the importance of getting things into the hands of a user quickly and then iterating   <br>* You actively think about when to incur technical debt and when to pay it back   <br>* You like to explore new technologies and have a keen eye for when something new can add real business value   <br>* You’ve probably spent most of your time over the last few years focussed on building React applications   <br>* You’re in favour of, but pragmatic about, automated testing. You like all production grade code to have good test coverage but understand when it may make sense to test MVP’s with a lower degree of test coverage   <br>* Bonus points for experience with Typescript / GraphQL   <br>   <br>#Salary   <br>£50-80k depending on location and experience   <br>   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- EU-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

Transportation technology is a hot market and we’re leading the charge, with raving fans and new customers signing up every day. We're looking for an experienced, driven, product-focused Senior Rails Engineer to help us deliver amazing features to our customers.   <br>   <br>   <br>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING   <br>   <br>Your work will be heavily focused toward high level, high impact areas. You’ll work closely with Product Managers and Designers to plan, design, and implement some of our more complex features. You’ll have a strong voice in the development and planning processes, so prior senior-level experience is key.   <br>   <br>We work in weekly sprints and use Pivotal Tracker to keep things organized. While we keep meetings to a minimum, our remote team is heavily collaborative and takes advantage of modern tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Zoom to stay in touch.   <br>   <br>Our stack includes Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Postgres and Heroku. We’re currently on Rails 5.1 and strive to keep our frameworks and libraries up to date.   <br>   <br>This is a position we consider essential to the company’s success. Be sure to mention coffee in your application so we know you actually read this.   <br>   <br>   <br>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU   <br>   <br>   <br>* Be a part of an incredible team of “A” players who go above and beyond to make Fleetio a successful company.

Crafting a delightful user experience is hard work, but we welcome the challenge and are looking for team members who share our ambition.   <br>   <br>We’re a startup that’s in “scale up” mode, meaning we’re past the days of just a couple of people in a small office, but we’re still very much a fast-paced, highly collaborative company.   <br>   <br>Our top goal as product engineers is adding value to our customers and we love to get changes out quickly. We've optimized our CI/CD to make it painless to run our test suite and get code into our production Heroku environments easily, resulting in an average of 40 deploys per week.   <br>   <br>We place great value on work/life balance and abhor the stereotypical 100 hours/week startup life. We have families and know you do, too.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p><p>Our Client Services Team is now on the lookout for a Senior Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>The Client Domain is all about innovation. Here we shape our products to satisfy the needs of our heterogeneous customer base. To achieve this you will collaborate closely with the Frontend Engineers of the Client Team to design and implement bespoke APIs and services that will be used by our different products and brands.</p><p>The Client Services Team is tasked with the development of all backend services required by our client applications, i.e. primarily the &nbsp;API Gateway of our platform but also client-related services such as authentication, internationalisation or content management and other backend services that allow us to provide a unique experience to a specific segment of our users. Being our platform’s gateway to the outside world, scalability and responsiveness is of utmost importance in the Client Domain. It is worth noting that the traffic pattern of our platform will not only be dictated by the sporting calendar but also by the sometimes unpredictable behaviour of our users.</p><p>By joining our team you will be working primarily in Elixir but you will also influence the full lifecycle of our software, starting with architectural and design decisions, all the way to the implementation, testing and monitoring of the resulting services.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location.

Essentially, we are a plug and play solution for mid-size businesses that require a talented team of developers. Any business in the world can benefit from software, which ensures your exposure to a wide range of industries and requirements as new projects come in. The common thread in all that variety is that our projects relate to MVC frameworks.</p><p><strong>Your income</strong></p><p>This is a full time position paid on an hourly basis ($30 per hour for 7+ years of experience, $25 per hour for less). Said in another way, you have more control over your income.</p><p>Earning money based on hourly pay means that you earn money in the exact same way that the company does: billing for time. Paying a salary would put competing incentives between the developer and the company. Instead, we tie your incentives directly in line with the company. So long as you work within our 25-35 hours per week guidelines, your income is 100% tied to how much you work.</p><p>Do you do an amazing job meeting customer expectations with a minimal number of bugs? That's called job security. Customers always have their favorite developers. Make a name for yourself with quality work.</p><p>Engineer ROI also believes that connecting income to time worked maximizes team quality. The kind of people that want to collect a salary and drag the team down are not attracted to the company. That means you will work with talented colleagues that are motivated to make you, the code and the entire team better.</p><p><strong>Quality of Life</strong> - Your work week totals 25-35 hours with 30 being the ideal amount. You can work at any time of day so long as your work hours are consistent and evenly spaced across 4-6 days per week. One of our teammates works from 11 pm - 5 am in his local time zone because that's when he wants to work. The company cares more about you working when you're at your peak mental state rather than the time of day when you work.</p><p>Meetings are strictly limited to when they are necessary. Because your income is based on your time worked (which includes meetings), the company is incentivized to value and protect your work time.</p><p><strong>An Engineer's Environment</strong> - Test driven development comes first. We do not build features until existing code passes all tests. You are assigned tasks with the repository, at which point you are expected to own the problem and fix it. Because we operate in a &quot;no micromanaging&quot; environment, we need a team player that sincerely cares about the impact his/her engineering decisions will have across the project.</p><p>Version control is paramount. Commits to a project are not meant to be a fancy save button. Commits tell the team, &quot;I have tested this feature and it's production ready.&quot;</p><p>The team practices phased releases to minimize the risk of breaking production. Development turns into a commit, which is then passed to staging. Only if staging passes and operates normally do we merge a commit merge from staging to master and release it into production.</p><p>Nobody wants to get yanked out of bed to fix fires (we should not be like IT people on call!). Slow and steady keeps us looking sharp and polished to clients and keeps emergencies to a minimum. It's better for us and it's better for our customers' businesses.</p><p><strong>Small Teams</strong> - The size of the company is 4 total. Your work is meaningful, appreciated and because of the small team size, you have the ability to significantly influence the architecture and frameworks used within a project.</p><p><strong>Technologies</strong></p><p>Django 2.0 and related apps:</p><ul><li>Django REST Framework</li><li>Celery, RabbitMQ</li></ul><p>Laravel and PHP</p><p>HTML5</p><p>Javascript:</p><ul><li>VUE</li><li>Bootstrap</li><li>React</li><li>Node</li><li>JQuery</li></ul><p>Docker, Git</p><p>PostgreSQL</p><p><strong>Must haves</strong></p><p>You must have 2+ years of direct experience with Django. Django is our MVC of choice and the technology that all developers in the organization share in common. In order to be considered for our senior level pay rate of $30/hr, you need to make your case for why you deserve to be a senior level developer.</p><p>Most Django developers also work in the frontend using Javascript and HTML5. Given the choice between an expert in Django and an expert in Javascript, we would choose Django. That said, our teammates need to come on board with a strong foundation in Javascript.</p><p>2+ years of experience using Git for version control.</p><p><strong>Nice to haves</strong></p><p>webpack, Docker, expertise across multiple Javascript libraries, years of experience working with multiple types of databases (especially PostgreSQL). Laravel and PHP are nice to make keep the team as a wide-ranging MVC shop.</p><p><strong>Day to Day</strong></p><p>We intentionally avoid chatter apps like Slack or Skype. Most questions do not require an immediate reply, making threads within the repository's issue tracker our preferred method of communication. The biggest challenge for any developer is to minimize interruptions to help you spend most of your workday in the zone. Keeping chatter restricted to the issue tracking system keeps conversations organized and minimizes distractions. Genuine emergencies are handled over phone calls or What's App.</p><p>About 80%+ of your time is spent architecting or writing code. The remaining time is spent on team communication - reviewing proposed solutions from teammates, clarification on requirements, etc.</p><p>The types of projects and problems you encounter are everything related to MVC frameworks. Identify business problems, abstract them into models and serve the content through a browser.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/201688?reset=False&amp;ra=15DFM45OD8U8&amp;oqs=a%3D15DFM45OD8U8' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Engineer ROI</h3>            <div><p>If forced to choose between technical expertise and teamwork, we choose teamwork every time. Our projects are too large for a single developer to manage on their own. Instead, the project manager distributes tasks in a way that leads to individuals owning large sections of code.</p><p>Because the team is 100% remote and the hours are flexible, everyone places a heavy emphasis on the following:</p><p>- Test driven development. Our code is a reflection of ourselves and our work ethic. Every member of the team needs to see prove to his colleagues that committed code is production ready.</p><p>- Incremental change. Major changes have a way of turning into major problems. Commits are best broken down into bite-sized steps to minimize the introduction of bugs.</p><p>- Proactive ownership over the code base. If you see a problem, create a new issue to ensure that the team addresses problems before clients even know that they exist. Team members are expected to not only find problems, but to feel motivated to fix them without direction.</p><p>Our current projects are for a network of hormone replacement therapy clinics across the United States and a forex managed account program. Both sites have been built from the ground up, ensuring that we have maximum knowledge and expertise across the entire stack.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Remote</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Set Your Own Hours</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

So expect to hear some unpleasant - but true - things sometimes. Don't hesitate to argue back - with respect - if you disagree.</li><li>Like any startup, It can be a mess some days.

We partner with over 900 schools - both district and charter - in underserved communities around the country, thus impacting more than 330,000 students.&nbsp;Third-party evaluations confirm that when schools have the right basic conditions in place and partner with ANet, they achieve 6-8 months of additional learning over a two-year period compared to schools not partnering with ANet.</p><p>At ANet we are committed to living out our&nbsp;<a href='http://www.achievementnetwork.org/what-drives-us/' rel='nofollow'>core values</a>, both across our organization and with our partner schools. We acknowledge that systemic inequities impact student access to opportunities and that in order to ensure educational equity for all students, we must center on the experiences of those from marginalized communities to guide our work. We work to deepen our understanding of how race, class, power and privilege influence the education system as well as influence our own perspectives. To do so,&nbsp; we provide ongoing learning opportunities through org-wide professional development, affinity groups, working groups, and resource sharing.</p><p>Individuals who join ANet have the opportunity to be part of a dynamic, values driven, and team-oriented organization that is committed to having impact in schools by investing in each other and learning together.&nbsp;We were named for the third year in a row as The NonProfit Times' “Best Nonprofits to Work For” and work tirelessly to foster a working environment where the unique perspectives, backgrounds, and identities of our staff members are valued.

We acknowledge that systemic inequities impact student access to opportunities and that in order to ensure educational equity for all students, we must center on the experiences of those from marginalized communities to guide our work. We work to deepen our understanding of how race, class, power and privilege influence the education system as well as influence our own perspectives. To do so,&nbsp; we provide ongoing learning opportunities through org-wide professional development, affinity groups, working groups, and resource sharing.</p><p>Individuals who join ANet have the opportunity to be part of a dynamic, values driven, and team-oriented organization that is committed to having impact in schools by investing in each other and learning together.&nbsp;We were named for the third year in a row as The NonProfit Times' “Best Nonprofits to Work For” and work tirelessly to foster a working environment where the unique perspectives, backgrounds, and identities of our staff members are valued.

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone’s day, you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p><p>At NearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

We are a fully distributed team with people working all around the world. You will have the flexibility and freedom to work in the environment of your choosing, whether that be at home, a cafe or co-working space. We're looking for a senior engineer to help build our API-First core app using JavaScript/AngularJS/React and Scala/Play.</p><p>ABOUT YOU</p><p>You love code. You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).</p><p>You love great UX. You spend most of your time coding, but you also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, you care about more than just the code.</p><p>You love learning new things. You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Scala, CSS, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it.</p><p>You can balance lots of concerns. Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.</p><p>You love helping others. You love sharing knowledge with the rest of your team, building shared tooling for other engineers, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers.</p><p>WHAT YOU’LL DO</p><ul><li>Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to planning our migration to React, implementing Redux best practices, and transitioning code to TypeScript.</li><li>Build reusable React components, migrate AngularJS components to React, manage data on the client with Redux, and test everything with Jasmine.</li><li>Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or custom tooling.</li><li>Refactor or improve existing code. We're planning to migrate our frontend to React, but we still have a lot of AngularJS code to clean up. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code.</li><li>Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.</li><li>Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality.</li><li>Review code written by other team members or other teams.</li><li>Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.</li></ul><p>WHAT YOU’LL BRING</p><ul><li>5+ years of software development experience</li><li>Experience with building and maintaining a SaaS product at scale</li><li>An affinity for creating software that is extensible, performant, and easy to read</li><li>A degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://angel.co/company/process-street/jobs/558380-remote-senior-frontend-engineer-javascript-angularjs-react' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Process Street</h3>            <div><ul><li>Cameron McKay - CTO -&nbsp;<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdmckay' rel='nofollow'>https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdmckay</a></li><li>Alex Agulyansky - Engineering Team Lead&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexagulyansky/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexagulyansky</a></li></ul>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Interesting Product</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large user base where you can see features in action</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Profitable and stable company</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Experienced Team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Organized processes</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Clear roadmap strategy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>API First</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We care a lot about our culture, having fun while working hard, and our annual retreats.</p><p>We are looking for a talented server-side architect to join our passionate development team. You will help tackle our most challenging problems as well as manage and mentor our team of senior developers.</p><p>This position requires that you have 10 years of experience (since graduation) and more than a few years of experience in each of the following areas: management experience, architecting complex Ruby on Rails apps (integration syncing, database locking, etc.), and building apps with React/Vue/Angular.</p><p>We’re a 100% remote team, that takes care to do good upfront design (specification documents, wireframes, and mockups) before starting to code and have fun working on our projects. We prioritize spending time to write unit tests to ensure we have great code coverage.</p><p>In this position you will work alongside our other architects and be responsible for assisting, and in many cases leading, architectural design, development, and deployment of our code bases. You will define solutions based on user/customer needs and within the constraints of our current implementation. The role includes writing specifications, having project management meetings, and reviewing code frequently.</p><p>A strong grasp of our tech stack and database strategies is required. While we are looking for someone who stays on top of industry trends and is aware of new technologies that could be used in the system architecture we emphasize a focus on battle-tested technologies.</p><p>This is a long-term (years, our hope is forever) full-time (40 hrs/wk) 1099 (hourly) contract role. Some of the benefits of working for us is our company-hosted annual retreat, that you get to choose your own schedule, work where you want (cafe, co-working location, your home, anywhere), don't have to ask for permission when you want to take time off, get to dedicate yourself to one project at a time, and have job security and a career path for years to come (we've run the company using positive cash flow from day one and are carefully growing the team and business).</p><p>You’ll be able to work 100% remotely.</p><p>You’ll be a good fit if you:</p><ul><li>Are self-disciplined and have a great work ethic</li><li>Have good time management skills</li><li>Communicate well</li><li>Love to learn new things</li><li>Are a full-stack engineer (UI/UX, backend, etc.)</li><li>Can work until at least 1pm EST (M - F)</li><li>Have at least 10 years of experience with server-side technologies</li><li>Have managed a team of 5 or more developers</li></ul><p>Requirements:</p><ul><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>React &amp; Redux / Vue.js / Angular</li><li>Javascript</li><li>jQuery</li><li>PostgreSQL (strong SQL expertise)</li><li>Unit tests (rspec, etc.)</li><li>Memory profiling</li><li>Performance profiling</li><li>Git strategies</li><li>SQL (query optimization, locking, etc.)</li><li>Practices TDD</li><li>Advanced debugging skills</li><li>API architecture</li><li>Background workers</li><li>Caching strategies</li><li>Writing design docs / specifications</li><li>Wireframing</li></ul><p>Bonus:</p><ul><li>Service workers architecture</li><li>Heroku</li><li>AWS</li><li>Docker</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/265197?reset=False&amp;ra=1qWcVXjOgrgQ&amp;oqs=a%3D1qWcVXjOgrgQ' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Hubstaff</h3>            <div><p>At Hubstaff we love doing things the &quot;Right way&quot; by talking to customers, writing specs, having copious amounts of unit testing, conducting peer code reviews, trying to break things during QA, and sleeping well at night. But we're always looking for ways to improve. People rarely work more than 40 hrs/wk and we spend&nbsp;0% of our time fighting fires.</p><p>There's no babysitting. You're in charge of yourself. That means you work where and when you want.</p><p>Culture is really important to us. But building culture in a remote team can be difficult. We do a lot of things to try to remedy that. Chief among them are our annual retreats. Last year our retreat was in Lisbon, Portugal. We had a hackathon, broke out of escape rooms, and ate lots of good food.</p><p>There's always something challenging to work and great people to spend your days with building things at Hubstaff.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible schedule</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote / Work from home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Job security / Long term</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

On the brighter side, that application is very stable and we've been able to dedicate more than 80% of our time to the new one.</p><p>Toptal's Talent Activation Team is organized using Agile best practices. We are a small, focused, and self-contained team with a Scrum Master, a dedicated QA Engineer, a Designer, and a Product Manager. Expect to make meaningful contributions from early on, and to have continuous learning opportunities, both technical and interpersonal. &nbsp;As with any other position at Toptal, we offer flexible working hours and location independence.

My name is Emma. Nice to meet you!</p><p>I’m the lead developer for a product called <a href='https://www.instilled.com/' rel='nofollow'>Instilled</a>, and we need your help building the best all-remote development team possible. You’ll be entrusted with the freedom and independence to go out and do your best work, and have the opportunity to make a real, outsized contribution to an entirely new culture and identity. And so, if that sounds appealing to you, read on: We’d like you to join us.</p><p>Our product is a video delivery platform—think of it like an enterprise YouTube—but it has the potential to be something bigger. We believe it can form the core of a next-generation learning product that consolidates all of an organization’s learning content into a single platform, making it easy for learners to find relevant content and for companies to make sense of all the data these learning activities generate. This is a unique opportunity, because&nbsp;Instilled already has a stable and profitable customer base, but this new direction gives us the chance to tap into a large new market.</p><p><br><strong>Requirements</strong><br>We have a lot of flexibility in who we can hire, but that’s not to say we aren’t picky! We’re looking for backend and frontend devs located in the United States or the United Kingdom and with experience levels spanning junior bootcamp grads to senior engineers. Precisely because this is an all-remote team, we take culture very seriously. We’re looking for developers who value what we value, namely:</p><ul><li><strong>Excellent communication skills.</strong> When your team is remote, every interaction counts!</li><li><strong>Self-directedness.</strong> You own your work and take responsibility for getting it done because your team members are counting on you. Sometimes this means going heads down and just coding. Sometimes it means knowing when to ask for help. But, in all cases, you are the engine driving your work to completion.</li><li><strong>Helpfulness.</strong> There is nothing worse in a remote position than feeling stuck. That’s why it’s important to be the kind of person who is willing to help a coworker—to offer insight from when you’ve worked on that same code or to rubber-duck a difficult bug—because we’re all in this together and we’ll all need it in return someday.</li><li><strong>“Reading Comprehension.”</strong> We aren’t building an app from the ground up; there is a product with a storied history here, written by people who knew what they were doing. You need to be able to make sense of other people’s legacy code and change it carefully.</li><li><strong>Flexibility.</strong> Our current tech stack is comprised of Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, Angular, and others, but things change. Prior experience with these is not required—we know that skilled developers come from all backgrounds—but you must be more than able to adapt to whatever technology the task demands.</li><li><strong>Willingness to speak up.</strong> We have a lot of things to figure out—from considering far-reaching architectural decisions, to configuring our linter for tabs or spaces, to figuring out an optimal meeting schedule, to creating an even more welcoming space for our team. We want people who aren’t afraid to speak up and push to make things better.</li></ul><p><strong>How to apply</strong><br>If this sounds like you, include a cover letter in your application letting us know why you'd be a great fit for the team and what interests you about this job specifically. Tell us about the kind of developer you are, what motivates you, how you approach your work, and the kinds of problems you've solved—don't just list the technologies you've worked with. Better yet, tell us about a situation or project where&nbsp;you demonstrated one of the qualities listed above. If you have publicly available code that you're proud of, include a link to that, too.</p><p>If you want, you may (but don't have to) include a résumé. But the letter is the most important part—make it count!&nbsp;(A résumé alone doesn’t let us get to know you well enough to determine whether we'd work well together.)</p><p>We’re looking forward to hearing from you soon!</p><p>Emma</p>                </div>            <div>    <h3>Reactions to this job</h3>    <div>        <div>                                                        <span>16</span>                                                                        <span>0</span>                                                                        <span>5</span>                                                                        <span>0</span>                                                                        <span>0</span>                                                                        <span>0</span>                        </div>    </div>        <div>            <div>                <div>                    <div></div>                </div>                <div>                    <strong>New!</strong> How do you feel about this job listing?                </div>                <div>                                    </div>            </div>        </div>        <div></div></div><div>Company: gomo video | No office location<br></div>                    <h3>Remote details</h3>                    <div>                        <div>                                                            <div>                                    <span>Preferred Timezone:</span>                                    <span>(GMT-04:00) Atlantic Time - Halifax +/- 4 hours</span>                                </div>                                                                                                            </div>                    </div>                <h3>Technologies</h3><div></div><div>java</div><div>spring</div><div>postgresql</div><div>angular</div><div>        <a href='https://ltg.workable.com/jobs/955528/candidates/new' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Pension Contributions</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>ShareSave Scheme</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Discretionary Bonus Scheme</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Travel Loans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Access to Perkbox</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Healthcare Cash Plan</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

You have an excellent opportunity to jump on-board and&nbsp;join us on this exciting journey. Here is the portrait of a&nbsp;person we’re looking for.</em></p><p>You agree that JavaScript&nbsp;has&nbsp;won the war, at least for now. It’s your favorite tool, and you mastered it while making apps and web servers for years. Your favorite front-end framework is <a href='http://react.js/' rel='nofollow'>React.js</a>. You can use it in different variations depending on a task and a project size. You are an expert in <a href='http://node.js/' rel='nofollow'>node.js</a>. You know it’s architecture, and you don’t hesitate to use a profiler to improve the performance of a service. You’re following best development practices. Your code is nice and clean, and you can be on the same page with your teammates about this. You passed through times of manual deployments and now enjoy the era of Docker containers. However, you prefer to be serverless. Although you can spin up any services and self-manage them, you're more happy&nbsp;with using managed cloud solutions. You love Firebase. You can tell us at least a couple of stories how did it help you to solve a business problem in hours instead of days and weeks. You’re not trying to dump QA responsibility on someone else. You agree that testing is a developer’s responsibility. You&nbsp;are proud of your typical above 95% test coverage. You can organize CI/CD flow and push a constant stream of features and patches to a staging environment, then to the production.&nbsp; We are all constantly learning, but that’s not your first reason for joining us.&nbsp;You come here, first and foremost,&nbsp;to add another solid mark in your track record of successful projects. You&nbsp;listen to business needs and can evaluate priorities.&nbsp;You don’t want to be micromanaged.&nbsp;You are feature and delivery oriented. You&nbsp;are&nbsp;keen to make a great product.

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p><p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</p><p>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p><ul><li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li><li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li><li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li><li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li><li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li><li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li><li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li></ul><p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p><p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p><p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p><p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Analytics Fire</h3>            <div><p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p><p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

Our platform is used in more than 60 countries worldwide and has the scale and adoption which will allow you to make an impact globally.</p><p>We give you a lot of flexibility and freedom and there is no micro-management or strict hierarchies. At&nbsp;DHIS 2 we believe you will do your best work if you fully understand the context which the system operates in. As a result you are&nbsp;encouraged to engage directly with our projects, take part in the design process and get feedback from users in the field. If you like travelling there will be opportunities to go to other continents and be part of requirement meetings and workshops.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>5 weeks of holiday</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>The best tools - workstations, tablets, phones</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Generous parental leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great retirement savings contributions</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Modern offices with central location</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Transportation technology is a hot market and we’re leading the charge, with raving fans and new customers signing up every day. We're looking for an experienced, driven, product-focused Senior Rails Engineer to help us deliver amazing features to our customers.</p><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING</strong></p><p>Your work will be heavily focused toward high level, high impact areas. You’ll work closely with Product Managers and Designers to plan, design, and implement some of our more complex features. You’ll have a strong voice in the development and planning processes, so prior senior-level experience is key.</p><p>We work in weekly sprints and use Pivotal Tracker to keep things organized. While we keep meetings to a minimum, our remote team is heavily collaborative and takes advantage of modern tools such as Slack, Google Drive, and Zoom to stay in touch.</p><p>Our stack includes Ruby/Rails, AngularJS, Bootstrap, Postgres and Heroku. We’re currently on Rails 5.1 and strive to keep our frameworks and libraries up to date.</p><p>This is a position we consider essential to the company’s success. Be sure to mention coffee in your application so we know you actually read this.</p><p><strong>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU</strong></p><ul><li>Be a part of an incredible team of “A” players who go above and beyond to make Fleetio a successful company. We’re a customer-centric team with a great product, excellent support, and countless happy customers.</li><li>Work from our HQ in Birmingham, AL or remotely. 50% of our Engineering Team works remotely and we strive to promote a strong remote working culture.</li><li>Build software used by people all around the world. So many different types of companies and organizations operate a fleet each day, and Fleetio is a good fit for most of them (it’s a huge market).</li></ul><p><strong>OUR TEAM</strong></p><p>We're hardcore believers in easy-to-use software. Crafting a delightful user experience is hard work, but we welcome the challenge and are looking for team members who share our ambition.</p><p>We’re a startup that’s in “scale up” mode, meaning we’re past the days of just a couple of people in a small office, but we’re still very much a fast-paced, highly collaborative company.</p><p>Our top goal as product engineers is adding value to our customers and we love to get changes out quickly. We've optimized our CI/CD to make it painless to run our test suite and get code into our production Heroku environments easily, resulting in an average of 40 deploys per week.</p><p>We place great value on work/life balance and abhor the stereotypical 100 hours/week startup life. We have families and know you do, too.

    "content": "<h2> Senior Front-end Web Developer for E-Commerce Agency </h2><div><div>Hi there! Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Xavier Armand and I am the co-founder of The Vaan Group (www.vaangroup.com): a fully remote UX design and engineering agency with headquarters in NYC. We’re looking to hire a senior front-end web developer to work on e-commerce projects.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We build commerce engines. We're not a 360 agency. We're not a marketing agency. We're a design and engineering studio. That’s our difference. Our e-commerce stores are designed and built to give our clients a technical edge over their competition. To do this, we synthesize business requirements, UX requirements, marketing requirements, technology requirements and creative requirements into a single digital shopping experience built for our clients and their consumers – a commerce engine. Our technology becomes the foundation upon which business' scale their operations, escalate their marketing efforts and grow their sales. The value of our work is defined by how big of a moat our clients’ technology creates between them, their competition, and Amazon.</div><div><br></div><div>Our clients range from large e-commerce enterprises (&gt;$100M per year) to successful mid-stage ($1M - $100M per year) direct to consumer (DTC) e-commerce brands. We very often work with the following platforms: Shopify Plus, DatoCMS, ReCharge Payments, and Algolia</div><div><br></div><div>We’re a realistic group, not looking for rockstar ninja wizards or whatever people say these days. Our team resides (or is working from) around the USA, Poland, Spain, Brazil, and Norway. We are looking for someone with experience building custom front-end experiences. By experience I mean we're looking for someone who's led the development of commercially available custom websites or apps (big bonus for e-commerce).&nbsp; Agencies are problem solvers by nature - we often march forward with 70% of a brief and our clients expect us to complete the puzzle. A perfect candidate has well-formed opinions, great discipline, naturally established work habits, and takes delight in their work.</div><div><br></div><div>A great quote about what we're looking for from people who have been managing remote teams longer than us:</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;Everyone has to be an A-player. Remote team members are used to four to six hours of focused, uninterrupted work every day. You have to be able to get through problems on your own and be productive without asking for help. There’s no substitute for skill and experience in those cases.&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>We have specific work to be done so can hire quickly. Shopify experience optional but a plus!</div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more Programming jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><span>New <i></i></span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>RebelMouse</span><br><span>Senior Frontend Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>Global</span></a></li><li><span>New <i></i></span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Clevertech</span><br><span>Javascript Full Stack Developer (US - Remote)</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>North America and Europe</span></a></li><li><span>New <i></i></span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Clevertech</span><br><span>Cloud Solution Architect</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>North America and Canada</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

Having these skills is great, but we know the best engineers can pick them up quickly when needed.</p><p></p><strong>What We Value</strong><p>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, challenging the status quo, nothing is “not my job”, having empathy, being direct, and being honest.</p><p>As engineers we believe in picking the right tool for the job, balancing technical excellence with pragmatism, having strong opinions weakly held, and attacking ideas not people.</p><p></p><strong>What We Offer</strong><ul></ul><li>Autonomy, impact, and ownership.

We are a fully distributed team with people working all around the world. You will have the flexibility and freedom to work in the environment of your choosing, whether that be at home, a cafe or co-working space. We're looking for a senior engineer to help build our API-First core app using JavaScript/AngularJS/React and Scala/Play.</p><p>ABOUT YOU</p><p>You love code. You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).</p><p>You love great UX. You spend most of your time coding, but you also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, you care about more than just the code.</p><p>You love learning new things. You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Scala, CSS, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it.</p><p>You can balance lots of concerns. Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.</p><p>You love helping others. You love sharing knowledge with the rest of your team, building shared tooling for other engineers, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers.</p><p>WHAT YOU’LL DO</p><ul><li>Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to planning our migration to React, implementing Redux best practices, and transitioning code to TypeScript.</li><li>Build reusable React components, migrate AngularJS components to React, manage data on the client with Redux, and test everything with Jasmine.</li><li>Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or custom tooling.</li><li>Refactor or improve existing code. We're planning to migrate our frontend to React, but we still have a lot of AngularJS code to clean up. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code.</li><li>Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.</li><li>Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality.</li><li>Review code written by other team members or other teams.</li><li>Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.</li></ul><p>WHAT YOU’LL BRING</p><ul><li>5+ years of software development experience</li><li>Experience with building and maintaining a SaaS product at scale</li><li>An affinity for creating software that is extensible, performant, and easy to read</li><li>A degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field</li></ul><p></p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we’re leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we’ve grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~33 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.</p><a href='https://close.com/' rel='nofollow'>Close</a><p>Our app’s frontend is a single-page JavaScript web app mostly written in React (originally built with Backbone.js). We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Enzyme and Mocha run via Puppeteer. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using BEM methodology and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC.</p><p>We care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi Freehand wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Sketch/Abstract and code.</p><p>Our frontend app is built on top of our REST API &amp; GraphQL endpoints. Our backend&nbsp;&nbsp;consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. We run our services in Docker on AWS.</p><a href='https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close' rel='nofollow'>tech stack</a><p>We ❤ open source – using dozens of open source projects with contributions to many of them, and released some of our own like&nbsp;,&nbsp;,&nbsp;,&nbsp;and more at&nbsp;.</p><a href='https://github.com/closeio/mic-recorder-to-mp3' rel='nofollow'>Microphone Recorder to Mp3</a><a href='https://github.com/closeio/filevalidator.js' rel='nofollow'>filevalidator.js</a><a href='https://github.com/closeio/addresscompiler' rel='nofollow'>addresscompiler</a><a href='https://github.com/closeio/backbone.mousetrap' rel='nofollow'>backbone.mousetrap </a><a href='https://github.com/closeio' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/closeio</a><p></p><strong>About You</strong><p>We’re looking for an experienced full-time Frontend Software Engineer to join our engineering team.

Our app was initially written in Angular 1.x, but our approach moves it close to how modern apps use React - no two-way data binding, no global state, data is passed down and events bubble up (via event handlers.)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>State is managed by a Reflux-like approach with RxJS streams. A state stream consumes various action-streams, and produces a state object that’s passed to the top-level angular directive.</p><p>We’re looking for someone who really loves writing front-end software and solving the various technical challenges that arise - optimizing time-to-first-meaningful-paint, optimizing bundle size and page load time, low input latency, etc.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re excited about progressive web apps, efficient resource caching with service workers or experimenting with the newest Javascript-targeting transpiling languages, please don’t hesitate to reach out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>As a fully remote team, communication is extremely important - there is no chance to drop in on interesting discussions around the water cooler, or to see if someone is busy just by glancing at their desk. We have systems to signal busy-ness; regular meetings and stand-ups to disseminate information, frequent one-on-ones to ensure there are no frustrations building up, a code of conduct and a formal complaint process to resolve conflicts early-on.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>As a key member of our&nbsp;front-end&nbsp;team, you’ll:</p><ul><li><p>Implement requirements provided by the UX developer</p></li><li><p>Tackle difficult coding problems like caching, concurrency and state management</p></li><li><p>Write effective high-quality code with a focus on performance and maintainability</p></li><li><p>Improve our architecture</p></li><li><p>Maintain and optimize our front-end build processes</p></li><li><p>Create reliable tests and work closely with our QA team for end-to-end testing</p></li></ul><p>Requirements:</p><ul><li><p>You thrive in a self-directed and open work environment. There’s no boss breathing down your neck, no deadlines, no fixed work hours and no in-office requirements. It’s&nbsp;really important&nbsp;that you can manage your time well, and you know what you need in order to do your job well (e.g. what work hours to pick so you have enough time to communicate with team members effectively)</p></li><li><p>Lots of experience building and maintaining single-page apps</p></li><li><p>Familiarity with multiple modern Javascript and CSS frameworks</p></li><li><p>Experience with modern front-end build processes and current trends like new languages transpiling to Javascript or compiling to WASM</p></li><li><p>Familiarity with functional programming and bonus points for reactive programming experience</p></li><li><p>Experience with&nbsp;automated testing of client-side Javascript (both integration and unit tests)</p></li><li><p>Good understanding of front-end performance optimizations</p></li></ul><p>Interested?</p><p>Lasso’s vision is to be the technology hub for new home sales in North America by providing a unique combination of remarkable software and expert services.

Our vision is to use decentralised technology to enable any doctors to be instantly onboarded and free to work anywhere across the NHS.<br /><br />Messly is the professional network for UK doctors, with 19,000 doctors registered. Doctors use Messly to connect with colleagues, share information and find work near to them.<br /><br />Our staffing platform, Messly Locum enables NHS Trusts to find and connect with doctors from the Messly community to fill temporary shifts in their hospitals, and allows doctors to move between Trust ‘staff banks’ to fill shifts as needed, and managing the shift booking and administrative processes.<br /><br />During the process of building and selling Messly Locum, we discovered a number of critical failures in the pre-employment checks which verify the identity of new doctors when they are registered with a Trust. This verification process commonly takes up to three months for each doctor at each Trust due to inefficiencies in the current process, the reliance on paper forms and the lack of technology solutions to solve these inefficiencies.<br /><br />We have secured InnovateUK funding to develop real-time, low-cost, high-trust digital identity verification for doctors using distributed ledger technology.<br /><br />We have already built a straw man prototype in Hyperledger Fabric/Indy, with some tokenisation elements included and now we are building out a dedicated team to focus on MesslyID, which will sit as part of the wider Messly team.",

Our app was initially written in Angular 1.x, but our approach moves it close to how modern apps use React - no two-way data binding, no global state, data is passed down and events bubble up (via event handlers.)&nbsp;   <br>&nbsp;   <br>   <br>State is managed by a Reflux-like approach with RxJS streams. A state stream consumes various action-streams, and produces a state object that’s passed to the top-level angular directive.   <br>   <br>We’re looking for someone who really loves writing front-end software and solving the various technical challenges that arise - optimizing time-to-first-meaningful-paint, optimizing bundle size and page load time, low input latency, etc.&nbsp;   <br>&nbsp;   <br>   <br>If you’re excited about progressive web apps, efficient resource caching with service workers or experimenting with the newest Javascript-targeting transpiling languages, please don’t hesitate to reach out.&nbsp;   <br>&nbsp;   <br>   <br>As a fully remote team, communication is extremely important - there is no chance to drop in on interesting discussions around the water cooler, or to see if someone is busy just by glancing at their desk. We have systems to signal busy-ness; regular meetings and stand-ups to disseminate information, frequent one-on-ones to ensure there are no frustrations building up, a code of conduct and a formal complaint process to resolve conflicts early-on.&nbsp;   <br>&nbsp;   <br>   <br>As a key member of our&nbsp;front-end&nbsp;team, you’ll:   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Implement requirements provided by the UX developer   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Tackle difficult coding problems like caching, concurrency and state management   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Write effective high-quality code with a focus on performance and maintainability   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Improve our architecture   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Maintain and optimize our front-end build processes   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Create reliable tests and work closely with our QA team for end-to-end testing   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Requirements:   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>You thrive in a self-directed and open work environment. There’s no boss breathing down your neck, no deadlines, no fixed work hours and no in-office requirements. It’s&nbsp;really important&nbsp;that you can manage your time well, and you know what you need in order to do your job well (e.g. what work hours to pick so you have enough time to communicate with team members effectively)   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Lots of experience building and maintaining single-page apps   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Familiarity with multiple modern Javascript and CSS frameworks   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Experience with modern front-end build processes and current trends like new languages transpiling to Javascript or compiling to WASM   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Familiarity with functional programming and bonus points for reactive programming experience   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Experience with&nbsp;automated testing of client-side Javascript (both integration and unit tests)   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Good understanding of front-end performance optimizations   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Interested?   <br>   <br>Lasso’s vision is to be the technology hub for new home sales in North America by providing a unique combination of remarkable software and expert services. To achieve our vision we need great developers. That’s why we’ve created a great work environment, encouraging self-direction, personal development, and teamwork.   <br>&nbsp;   <br>   <br>Lasso is based in Richmond, BC, Canada.

Our Senior Technology Lead will help us use the programming languages we work in every day as they&nbsp;should&nbsp;be used, not as they&nbsp;can&nbsp;be used. Yes, to ship features (we’re not a language research lab and we’re not afraid of a slightly inelegant hack that gets the job done without polluting the codebase) but to be able to look back and see that we used the right abstractions, that our architecture served our business needs, that we didn’t brute force what we could have finessed. To achieve this end we need someone to manage our technical review process and shepherd our code quality within one of our four-person development teams. And, be jointly responsible for the enterprise architecture strategy of the whole technology team.</div><div><br></div><div>At some companies we observe a familiar and depressing pattern: the most technically excellent developers hit a ceiling beyond which they can’t progress unless they start taking on direct “reports”, and becoming “managers”. Given no other options they launch themselves down this path. As they progress they spend less and less time doing the thing that they love (crafting excellent code) while they learn a completely different craft — management — and spend more and more time dealing with people and their problems. At Bellroy we love the people who want to make that transition, but we don’t think that it should be the only way to progress your career, and we make sure that we have a technical stream that allows people to keep getting better at programming. This is a role in that technical stream.</div><div><br></div><div>The majority of our current codebases are in pure Ruby or Ruby on Rails, so you must have at least a working understanding of these technologies. We use React and Elm in the front-end, and we’re starting to move more toward the latter. We're striving for a headless e-commerce model and re-assessing our technical stack. You will have opportunities to learn and master new programming languages and frameworks (we’re excited about Haskell, Go and Rust, among others).</div><div><br></div><div>A quick note: We’re currently advertising a number of roles, so if this one doesn’t quite tick all of your boxes, check out our&nbsp;<a href='https://bellroy.com/careers/senior-team-lead-technology' rel='nofollow'>Senior Team Lead</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://bellroy.com/careers/back-end-developer' rel='nofollow'>Back-end Developer</a>&nbsp;roles. If your ideal job is some combination of the advertised roles, apply anyway. As part of your application, tell us what you’re really looking for.</div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h3><strong>YOU COULD BE THE ONE, IF…</strong></h3></div><ul><li>Have a solid technical background in Ruby on Rails, but recognise that it has limitations</li><li>Consistently deliver high quality code with strong, well-researched design principles</li><li>Want a key role in technology selection and architecture, and don’t see people management as the right way to progress in your career</li><li>Care more about tabs vs spaces than Scrum vs Kanban</li><li>Get excited about great books and the ideas you can steal from them – technical and non-technical books alike</li><li>Think a workplace with dogs, coffee, breakout spaces and casual dresscode sounds like a great place to be</li><li>Want to work for a company that cares about doing good things for the world</li></ul><div><br></div><div><h3><strong>LOCATION AND HOURS</strong></h3></div><div>This can be a full-time role located in our Fitzroy office, or a full-time remote position from anywhere in the world. That’s up to you.</div><div><br></div><div>Start Day:&nbsp;We're ready when you are!</div><div><br></div></div>",

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$95K (mid-level), $95K-115K (Senior).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

It appears to be more thorough, personal, caring, and honest by far than any other I've seen. In my experience there are qualities present in a company's management that tend to permeate through all levels and find expression in many subtle ways. If I am reading into what I am seeing correctly then this would be an exceptional place to work. I'm not sure how to say it other than that. It was just kind of a feeling after looking over the page, that this is where I want to be.</p></blockquote><p>JF, 10/2018</p><blockquote><p>I'm extremely impressed with how much effort your organization puts into describing work opportunities! By far, this is the most helpful job posting I have ever seen. I intend to respond in a point-by-point fashion, as that seems to be the most efficient way to proceed. I hope to repay honesty with honesty.</p></blockquote><p>JH 8/2018:</p><blockquote><p>Like I mentioned before, I really like the whole interview process that you guys have.&nbsp; That in combination with how you guys responded to emails, etc. gave me a very positive impression of your company and I am still interested in working with you guys someday.</p></blockquote><p>LB, 8/2018</p><blockquote><p>The feedback I received from [your first skills assessment] was amazing!&nbsp; That was fantastic! I was really impressed with it.</p></blockquote><p>KM, 9/2018</p><blockquote><p>I just wanted to reach out and give you some really positive feedback. If I could go back in time and finish up those final interviews with you, I would do it in a heartbeat. I can already see a huge difference in personality between you and those who lead the company I joined -- and I think it speaks volumes. Keep being a great person!</p><p>I hope you found a great candidate in the end!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

This makes our user-facing teams, and the software layer that connects them with users, mission-critical: users need fast, accurate, contextualized answers to their questions, 24/7, over phone, chat, and email.   <br>   <br>The Support Products engineering team builds and improves Stripe’s support experience including paid support offerings, from end to end: how users get help within our products, how they get in touch with us when they have questions, and how our teams use internal tools to answer those questions. We’re accountable for the quality and reliability of this support stack and we use data and firsthand user research to continuously improve it. We’re a small, distributed team of capable, friendly, user-oriented engineers and we partner closely with Stripe’s world-class design, product, infrastructure, and operational teams. Providing great support to users of all sizes is culturally important to everyone at Stripe.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> **You will:**   <br>* Build, operate, and improve support products for all of Stripe’s users from one-person startups to Premium Support users and large enterprises.   <br>* Work side-by-side with user-facing teams to understand their needs, develop short-term and long-term solutions, and deploy those solutions across our global 24/7 support operation.   <br>* Own problems from end to end, managing complexity and engaging directly with stakeholders to think through everything from business impact, to reliability and operability, to the pixel-perfection of individual support interactions.   <br>* Uphold Stripe’s high standards for engineering and product quality and mentor newer team members to do the same.   <br>   <br>**You might work on:**   <br>* Building engaging, responsive user interfaces that make it truly enjoyable to get help from Stripe. For example, we used React to build a chat UI from the ground up so that it would feel truly at home in the Stripe Dashboard.   <br>* Scaling the contact platform that connects Stripe users with the teams that are best equipped to help them. This might involve implementing new API endpoints for use across multiple products, iterating on data pipelines to maximize visibility into our support operations, or adding to our billing pipeline so that we can offer paid support plans in new regions.   <br>* Improving the internal tools that empower our user-facing teams to build new case-solving workflows, publish dynamic, localized content to our user-facing support site, and answer every support request with the right context for any user.   <br>   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>**You may be fit for this role if you:**   <br>* Enjoy being a generalist, working on frontend, backend, infrastructure, data pipelines, or billing pipelines as needed to solve problems and delight our users. (You don’t need to be an expert in all of these but it helps to be interested in learning about them.)   <br>* Contribute high-quality code to create trustworthy and engaging user interfaces and resilient and operable backend systems. We build on top of storage and queueing systems, UI component libraries, and other foundations maintained by Stripe’s infrastructure teams and work mostly with Ruby, JavaScript (React), AWS, Terraform, Puppet, SQL, HTML, and CSS. (None of us are experts in all of these either.)   <br>* Seek out feedback from your users and empathetically advocate for them throughout the product development process.   <br>* Take pride in shepherding projects from ideation to completion, where completion often involves partnering with operational teams to carefully roll out changes that affect their workflows.   <br>* Thrive in a collaborative environment involving different functions, stakeholders, and subject matter experts.  </div> </div>",

    "content": "<span><h2>Software Developer&nbsp;</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>gomo video</h3></span> <div>  <div>   <br>Hi! My name is Emma. Nice to meet you!   <br>   <br>I’m the lead developer for a product called gomo Video, and we need your help building the best all-remote development team possible. You’ll be entrusted with the freedom and independence to go out and do your best work, and have the opportunity to make a real, outsized contribution to an entirely new culture and identity. And so, if that sounds appealing to you, read on: We’d like you to join us.   <br>   <br>Our product is a video delivery platform—think of it like an enterprise YouTube—but it has the potential to be something bigger. We believe it can form the core of a next-generation learning product that consolidates all of an organization’s learning content into a single platform, making it easy for learners to find relevant content and for companies to make sense of all the data these learning activities generate. This is a unique opportunity, because gomo Video already has a stable and profitable customer base, but this new direction gives us the chance to tap into a large new market.   <br>   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>We have a lot of flexibility in who we can hire, but that’s not to say we aren’t picky! We’re looking for backend and frontend devs located in the United States or the United Kingdom and with experience levels spanning junior bootcamp grads to senior engineers. Precisely because this is an all-remote team, we take culture very seriously. We’re looking for developers who value what we value, namely:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Excellent communication skills. When your team is remote, every interaction counts!   <br>   <br>* Self-directedness. You own your work and take responsibility for getting it done because your team members are counting on you. Sometimes this means going heads down and just coding. Sometimes it means knowing when to ask for help. But, in all cases, you are the engine driving your work to completion.   <br>   <br>* Helpfulness. There is nothing worse in a remote position than feeling stuck. That’s why it’s important to be the kind of person who is willing to help a coworker—to offer insight from when you’ve worked on that same code or to rubber-duck a difficult bug—because we’re all in this together and we’ll all need it in return someday.   <br>   <br>* “Reading Comprehension.” We aren’t building an app from the ground up; there is a product with a storied history here, written by people who knew what they were doing. You need to be able to make sense of other people’s legacy code and change it carefully.   <br>   <br>* Flexibility. Our current tech stack is comprised of Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, Angular, and others, but things change. Prior experience with these is not required—we know that skilled developers come from all backgrounds—but you must be more than able to adapt to whatever technology the task demands.   <br>   <br>* Willingness to speak up. We have a lot of things to figure out—from considering far-reaching architectural decisions, to configuring our linter for tabs or spaces, to figuring out an optimal meeting schedule, to creating an even more welcoming space for our team. We want people who aren’t afraid to speak up and push to make things better.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>How to apply   <br>If this sounds like you, let us know in your application why you'd be a great fit for the team and what interests you about this job specifically. Tell us about the kind of developer you are, what motivates you, how you approach your work, and the kinds of problems you've solved—don't just list the technologies you've worked with. If you have publicly available code that you're proud of, include a link to that, too. If you want, you may (but don't have to) include a résumé. But the letter is most important because a résumé alone doesn’t let us get to know you well enough to determine whether we'd work well together.   <br>   <br>We’re looking forward to hearing from you soon!   <br>   <br>Emma  </div> </div>",

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone’s day, you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.   <br>   <br>What will you be doing?   <br>   <br>At NearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop.

    "content": "<span><h2>Software Developer&nbsp;</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>gomo video</h3></span> <div>  <div>   <br>Hi! My name is Emma. Nice to meet you!   <br>   <br>I’m the lead developer for a product called gomo Video, and we need your help building the best all-remote development team possible. You’ll be entrusted with the freedom and independence to go out and do your best work, and have the opportunity to make a real, outsized contribution to an entirely new culture and identity. And so, if that sounds appealing to you, read on: We’d like you to join us.   <br>   <br>Our product is a video delivery platform—think of it like an enterprise YouTube—but it has the potential to be something bigger. We believe it can form the core of a next-generation learning product that consolidates all of an organization’s learning content into a single platform, making it easy for learners to find relevant content and for companies to make sense of all the data these learning activities generate. This is a unique opportunity, because gomo Video already has a stable and profitable customer base, but this new direction gives us the chance to tap into a large new market.   <br>   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>We have a lot of flexibility in who we can hire, but that’s not to say we aren’t picky! We’re looking for backend and frontend devs located in the United States or the United Kingdom and with experience levels spanning junior bootcamp grads to senior engineers. Precisely because this is an all-remote team, we take culture very seriously. We’re looking for developers who value what we value, namely:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Excellent communication skills. When your team is remote, every interaction counts!   <br>   <br>* Self-directedness. You own your work and take responsibility for getting it done because your team members are counting on you. Sometimes this means going heads down and just coding. Sometimes it means knowing when to ask for help. But, in all cases, you are the engine driving your work to completion.   <br>   <br>* Helpfulness. There is nothing worse in a remote position than feeling stuck. That’s why it’s important to be the kind of person who is willing to help a coworker—to offer insight from when you’ve worked on that same code or to rubber-duck a difficult bug—because we’re all in this together and we’ll all need it in return someday.   <br>   <br>* “Reading Comprehension.” We aren’t building an app from the ground up; there is a product with a storied history here, written by people who knew what they were doing. You need to be able to make sense of other people’s legacy code and change it carefully.   <br>   <br>* Flexibility. Our current tech stack is comprised of Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, Angular, and others, but things change. Prior experience with these is not required—we know that skilled developers come from all backgrounds—but you must be more than able to adapt to whatever technology the task demands.   <br>   <br>* Willingness to speak up. We have a lot of things to figure out—from considering far-reaching architectural decisions, to configuring our linter for tabs or spaces, to figuring out an optimal meeting schedule, to creating an even more welcoming space for our team. We want people who aren’t afraid to speak up and push to make things better.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>How to apply   <br>If this sounds like you, let us know in your application why you'd be a great fit for the team and what interests you about this job specifically. Tell us about the kind of developer you are, what motivates you, how you approach your work, and the kinds of problems you've solved—don't just list the technologies you've worked with. If you have publicly available code that you're proud of, include a link to that, too. If you want, you may (but don't have to) include a résumé. But the letter is most important because a résumé alone doesn’t let us get to know you well enough to determine whether we'd work well together.   <br>   <br>We’re looking forward to hearing from you soon!   <br>   <br>Emma  </div> </div>",

First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop.

Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, you care about more than&nbsp;&nbsp;the code.</p><strong>You love great UX.</strong><em>just</em><p>&nbsp;You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Python, CSS, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don’t already know it, you’re ready to learn it.</p><strong>You love learning new things.</strong><p>&nbsp;Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can’t control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.</p><strong>You can balance lots of concerns.</strong><p>You love sharing knowledge with the rest of your team, building shared tooling for other engineers, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers.</p><strong>You love helping others.&nbsp;</strong><p></p><strong>Things You Might Do</strong><p>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you’ll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you’ll probably do:</p><ul></ul><li>Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to GraphQL, server-side React rendering, and Flow typing.</li><li>Build reusable React components with modular CSS, manage data on the client with Redux and GraphQL, and test everything with Jest.</li><li>Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPagetest, or custom tooling.</li><li>Refactor or improve existing code. We’ve migrated most of our frontend to React, but we still have some Backbone code to clean up. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code.</li><li>Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.</li><li>Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality.</li><li>Review code written by other team members or other teams.</li><li>Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.</li><li>Work with complex and varied data structures (APIs can be a little, uh, eccentric).</li><li>Help out with our Python backend or Node-based developer platform.</li><li>Share what you know and learn either one-on-one or with lightning talks to the group.</li><li>Give back to the community via open source and blog posts.</li><li>Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change as we experiment with doing more custom partnership work</li><li>As a part of Zapier’s&nbsp;all-hands philosophy, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.</li><p>You’ll also have the opportunity to specialize in a variety of areas of the Zapier codebase, including core product or platform development. Focusing on a specialization will not limit your area for growth at Zapier as each engineer brings a unique perspective and can contribute differently in all areas. We encourage participation and will frequently have engineers contribute across teams to assist in projects.</p><p></p><strong>About Zapier</strong><p>For the past six years, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job. We do that by helping everyone connect the web applications they already use and love.</p><p>We believe that there are jobs a computer is best at doing and that there are jobs a human is best at doing.
