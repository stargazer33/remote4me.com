They are self-motivated, proactive, and have a strong team spirit. If you're tired of the traditional freelancing platforms, you'll be happy to hear that we’re so much more. X-Team is a community of like-minded individuals, carefully chosen to ensure that they can become part of the community of the most motivated people in the world who come together to unleash their potential. What we've created is truly special and not merely a faceless platform. X-Team is where developers go to feel truly at home together while becoming more motivated than they've ever been.<br><strong><br>How long does your vetting/interview process take?</strong></p><p>It varies depending on our immediate needs and how quickly you respond to our questions and requests. On average, it takes 1-3 weeks.</p><p>More importantly though, after a decade of interviewing developers, we've learned how important it is to respect people's time. We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p><p><strong>Will I get a job immediately after applying?</strong></p><p>If your skills, experience, and values align with a current opening we have, your chances of getting hired immediately are high. If we discover you're qualified, but all opportunities have been taken, we'll continue to work with you to help you get a role in X-Team.

We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p>We recently joined forces with a new team, Elastic Code Search and we are now looking to bring on board an experienced Software Engineer to join our globally distributed team.</p><p><strong><strong>What</strong>&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Elastic Code Search?</strong></strong></p><p>Elastic Code Search is a IDE-like semantic code search solution built on top of the Elastic Stack. It helps development teams to search, navigate and collaborate on large code bases more efficiently. Known previously as insight.io, the product has been used and loved by tens of thousands of developers and received 5 star review on chrome store. YOU will be a founding member of Elastic Code Search team and a shaper of the Elastic Code Search product.</p><p><strong><strong>About The Role</strong></strong></p><p>The Software Engineer for Program Analysis will lead our effort to build standardized and open sourced language service that provides code intelligence for both static and dynamic languages. This is the core component of Elastic Code Search, powering core features such as jump to definition, find references and semantic aware search. You’ll also help pushing code intelligence to new frontiers such as integration with logging, APM, etc.</p><p><strong><strong>About you</strong></strong></p><ul><li>5+ year of professional software engineering experience</li><li>Previous work or open source experience on projects like IDE, compiler or static analysis software</li><li>Solid knowledge of compiler and static analysis</li><li>A Computer Science degree or comparable experience</li><li>Passionate about developer productivity</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Nice to have</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Experience with TypeScript</li><li>Deep understanding of build system</li><li>Experience with large-scale data store such as Elasticsearch</li><li>Related research experience</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Additional Information</strong></strong></p><p>We're looking to hire team members invested in realizing the goal of making real-time data exploration easy and available to anyone.

Things like perseverance, passion, laser-like focus, a positive mindset, and the list goes on and on.</p><p>Avanoo exists to help employees at Fortune&nbsp;1,000 companies embody these attributes, through 3-minute-a-day video programs and deep analytics that help us understand what their people need the most and predict what sort of content can drive the most impact.</p><p>If the skills we learn in school are the applications we use to get through life, the attributes we help people embody at Avanoo are like the operating system.</p><p><strong>We're doing quite well</strong></p><p>We were VC-funded in 2015.&nbsp;Since then, we've been growing revenue by&nbsp;2-3x&nbsp;every single year.&nbsp;So far, we're on track for a 4x growth this year.</p><p>We've proven over and over again that we can help enterprises drive real impact to their bottom line just&nbsp;through the magic concoction we've put together.

We value your skills more than how long you’ve worked on an application, or whether or not you have a Computer Science degree. We don’t care how you’ve acquired those skills, or how long it took you—as a Senior Software Engineer, you should be able to demonstrate a high degree of expertise.</p><p><strong>Bonus qualifications<br></strong></p><p>As we’re working with a lot of newer technology, we don’t expect you to be fully-versed with our entire tech stack, but you should have some experience in a few of these technologies, exposure to several, and a willingness to learn new skills as necessary:</p><ul><li>Experience designing, developing, documenting, securing, and/or consuming a GraphQL API using Relay or Apollo</li><li>Experience developing inclusive, accessible applications, including experience with accessibility (a11y), internationalization (i18n), and localization (l10n)</li><li>Using MongoDB at Scale</li><li>Experience developing event-driven applications using software such as Kafka</li><li>Functional programming experience</li><li>Programming in a JVM language such as Clojure, or Scala</li></ul><ul><li>Experience developing commerce or logistics software</li><li>Experience developing and deploying containerized applications using Docker and/or Kubernetes</li><li>Experience developing with Elasticsearch or other search engine technology</li><li>Previous contributions to open source projects</li><li>Experience with Kafka</li><li>Experience using Clojure</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Characteristics</strong></strong></p><p>As a distributed team building open source software, we understand that being a great software engineer is much more than having a deep technical skillset.

Candidates who don’t submit the necessary information will not be considered.<br><br>If we decide to move forward with your application, we’ll schedule a 30-45 minute screening video call via Zoom to learn more about your interests, talk about the role, and determine if Reaction Commerce is a mutual fit</p><p>We’ll then have a series of technical interviews. The first interview will be a technical conversation where we’ll discuss previous experience and work to uncover how your skill set might fill a need at Reaction Commerce.</p><p>Following the technical interview we’ll have one or more interviews focused on collaboratively solving problems with members of the engineering team. These interviews will involve writing code in a remote pair-programming type of scenario.</p><p>Finally, if appropriate based on location, we’ll conduct an onsite interview so that you’ll have the opportunity to meet key stakeholders on the team. If we can’t do this in person, we’ll arrange it as a video call.</p><p>At the offer stage, you will learn more about compensation, equity range, and benefits. While the entire process can take 4-6 weeks total depending on schedule availability, we’re committed to communicating progress frequently so you won’t be left wondering about the status of your application. We look forward to meeting you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/197466?reset=False&amp;ra=14dSWOlaMuDm&amp;oqs=a%3D14dSWOlaMuDm' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>            <h3>About Reaction Commerce</h3>            <div><p>At Reaction Commerce, we believe that the best results comes from shared ideas.

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of the development team building our content management system(CMS) that powers our mobile and web applications. &nbsp;You will get to come to work everyday knowing you are helping educate millions of people all around the world.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned JavaScript developer and have a solid knowledge of modern JS frameworks.</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Vue.js, Postgres, Heroku and Rails.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and PTO.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p><p>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a web app, node package or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p><p><strong>Life at HLT</strong></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Remote working</li><li>Flexible hours</li><li>Large amounts of autonomy</li><li>Great pay, insurance, benefits</li></ul><p><strong>So Why HLT?</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in</p><ul><li>Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks</li><li>Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education</li><li>A fast paced and fun work environment</li><li>A career with a higher purpose</li></ul><p>Then we we would love to talk to you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/196220?reset=False&amp;ra=13NYEKqt7OyA&amp;oqs=a%3D13NYEKqt7OyA' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large amounts of autonomy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great pay, insurance, benfits</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We work hard but maintain a casual work environment with a strong culture as a tech startup.

We're growing steadily and to meet new demands, we’re developing new products that busy city staffers (and our own business) do and will rely on to make their cities better for their citizens. Candidates must have a passion for getting things done and be highly motivated. Candidates must thrive in an entrepreneurial environment and be eager to learn and contribute to the team setting. Ideally, we are seeking a Central-NJ based candidate.</p><p>This position is for a full-time, Software Engineer, who will work semi-autonomously and as a part of a small, but growing, team to design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain web-based, back-office software which runs our business, as well as significant portions of our customers' as well as on-the-street (usually literally) mobile software.</p><p>Our biggest challenges are, by design, behind the scenes, and experienced by our clients (the cities) and our own mobile workforce. We're not so much worried about achieving &quot;web scale&quot; as we are about making people's jobs and lives easier. And if we can add at least dash of whimsy in there, too, all the better!</p><p>PayLock helps cities with those &quot;necessary evil&quot; parts of city governance. We try to make those things less evil, both for the people doing them and the people having them done to them.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Candidates must have: great communication abilities (after all, we're a&nbsp;service company, and you'll inevitably be talking to customers), great problem solving skills, an insatiable curiosity and ability to learn, and an innate commitment to getting things done—or, more precisely, an innate need to not let things go undone. And a sense of humor doesn't hurt, either.</p><p>For starters, you'll need a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Design. Developers on our team also work on and develop database schemas, so you should have experience (and proficiency) with that as well. Since most of what we're doing is web-based, you've gotta know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and knowing how the Internet works work can't hurt you. If you understand that much, you probably know a lot about many other things and are constantly adding to your repertoire. In fact, you might not even be able to stop yourself. That's a characteristic we really, really dig: fast, eager, creative learners.</p><p>The kinds of things you might find yourself working on are:</p><ol><li>Building and/or extending a RESTful web api for an AngularJS web application</li><li>Designing and building business management tools (to help our business and our clients')--things like dashboards, alerts, and other &quot;knowledge radiators&quot;</li><li>Building and/or rebuilding a data movement pipeline (we do lots of data integrations with our clients and other 3rd parties)</li><li>Mobile apps for our in-the-field and on-the-road workforce</li><li>Tools for us, the developers, to make our own lives easier</li></ol><p>It's also important that you can keep two visions alive: the near-term and the long-term. We find ourselves juggling the needs of the business (often the near-term voice) and the needs of ourselves and the systems and applications we own on the business' behalf. You have to be strong enough to deliver on the near-term objectives while putting in that extra 10% to 20% of effort to accomplish our long-term (i.e. 3-year) objectives. You have to be ok with taking the hard road sometimes, and trust that it'll be worth it (we think it is).</p><p>Repeat after me: Refactoring is my friend. I will leave everything I work on better than I found it.</p><p>As a growing company, there are plenty of opportunities to pitch in, learn, and develop professionally, and help us&nbsp;reach new levels of greatness, and we're looking for folks who like the sound of that. Drop us a line if you're that person.</p><p># years experience required: years of experience!</p><p>WHEN APPLYING, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE INCLUDE A PARAGRAPH OR TWO ABOUT WHAT MAKES YOU TICK OR WHAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT--RESUMES AREN'T ENOUGH TO GO ON.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/16080?reset=False&amp;ra=5olFkXF3SeI&amp;oqs=a%3D5olFkXF3SeI' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About PayLock</h3>            <div><p>We are profitable AND well-funded 10+ year-old &quot;post-startup&quot; company focused on improving the current options available to municipalities, universities, and the parking enforcement community to quickly, easily, and humanely manage their ever-increasing challenges in parking enforcement--like collecting overdue parking tickets and managing limited parking real-estate while reducing costs. We offer them technologies and services which allow them to do their jobs quickly, easily, and much less painfully than ever before. And we are introducing cutting-edge tools, services and technologies that are literally changing the way people think about parking—from City Hall, which is passing legislation to allow it, to the officers on the street, who are enforcing those laws.

You ensure optimal user convenience of our website for our customers. You create a blazing fast and solid code that is well-structured and documented.</p><p><strong>Goals of our Firebase Developer</strong></p><p>Within your first weeks, you understand our repositories and the concept of our code base. You know the structure and grasp the what's, where's and why's of our code. You know the code and understand the underlying parts and foundations. You know our focus points. You will <strong>build your first tested and user-ready part of our webshop or cloud function</strong> from scratch by using internal and external API's. You receive approval from the users or collegues and feel hungry for more.</p><p>Within the first months you will be able to elaborate a complete subproject, consisting of new and existing cloud functionalities, <strong>from idea to operational product</strong>. Throughout the process, you communicate efficiently with all stakeholders to ensure that the result meets the demands and goals of the project. You make suggestions to improve working conditions and tools so that everybody can work in a more efficient and enjoyable way.</p><p>On the longer term, you will learn to <strong>manage the entire code base</strong>. You give shape to the building tools&nbsp;and manage large parts of the frontend - and possible also backend - webapps. You can easily respond to the needs and demands of the team.</p><p><strong>Skills and competencies</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Goal-driven</strong> - You are result-driven, focused, realistic and resourceful.</li><li><strong>Responsible</strong> - Most of the time you will work on your own. You have enough self-discipline to always go the extra mile for Pit&amp;Pit. You don't need anybody who directs or motivates you.</li><li><strong>Persistent</strong> - You are motivated and have a heart for Pit&amp;Pit. You are a go-getter. The possibilities in IT are endless: if you can explain it, you can program it. You love challenges.</li><li><strong>Energetic</strong> - You work hard, fast-paced, are vital and always want to go forward.</li><li><strong>Good judgement</strong> - You have your own opinion based on common sense and relevant criteria. You communicate your judgment in a clear manner and are willing to re-evaluate it if necessary.</li><li><strong>Vision</strong> - You are able to think ahead, you are aware of current market trends and new developments.</li><li><strong>Pragmatic</strong> - You do not like to work according to rigorous standard rules because 'that's the way everybody does it'. However, you work very orderly and structured. You dare to think out of the box: &quot;everybody said it wasn't possible, until someone came who did not know that&quot; (which was you).</li><li><strong>Innovative</strong> - Every day new, interesting projects and new opportunities pop up. An interest in new techniques is required in order to maintain the code of Pit&amp;Pit efficient and up to date. New insights and chances energize the whole team. For this reason you have to be very efficient at putting the most suitable innovations in development into practice so that efficiency and stability are continuously improved.</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experienced javascript developer, with demonstrable knowledge of svelte (or next.js)</li><li>Experience with the consumption&nbsp;of microservices / API's</li><li>Proactive</li><li>Independent, responsible and accountable</li><li>Energetic</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/167433?reset=False&amp;ra=U9pEBGPPbC8&amp;oqs=a%3DU9pEBGPPbC8' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Pit&amp;Pit</h3>            <div><p>We believe that everybody should be able to enjoy a healthy life.

The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are transparent, reliable and considerate. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.</p><p>Beyond this, our requirements are:</p><ul><li>You have experience leading a team of developers (remote is ideal!)</li><li>You have both front-end <em>and</em> back-end experience</li><li>You have experience with React - unless you have significant Javascript experience with other libraries so that you’ll be able to pick it up quickly</li><li>You have experience creating and iterating on products from end-to-end: we think there are certain things that freelance and agency work doesn’t teach you such as working end-to-end (full feature) on an entire system.</li><li>You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a> with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d <a href='https://cl.ly/3s0O4314002E' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>. Also, meet <a href='https://cl.ly/082v1Q2D0B2a' rel='nofollow'>Brice</a>, another engineer at Aula and former CTO! See an example of <a href='https://cl.ly/130A1h0V230k' rel='nofollow'>one of our remote offices here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. We’ve explained it in more detail in <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>this blog post</a>, but here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Microservices backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to develop skills in building both consumer tech interfaces as well core infrastructure back-ends</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack developer that can build features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile) and challenge our thinking on architecture. Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Pushing our thinking on core architecture choices</li><li>Be part of leading a high-performing team: inspiring team members, set priorities and own results</li><li>Building backend microservices</li><li>Working directly with Adrian, CPO and designer, to build, maintain and improve slick user interfaces across devices.</li><li>Switching between different apps and devices (web, desktop, iOS, Android).</li><li>Improving and maintaining our distributed architecture.</li></ul><p><strong>Interview process <br></strong>Interview processes&nbsp;don’t need to be scary and stressful for us to be able to pick out those of you that would fit in the best at Aula.</p><p>The first three stages all take place asynchronously in a dedicated Slack channel filled with other curious and smart candidates - it’s turned out to be <a href='https://cl.ly/1P1P2i0k1320' rel='nofollow'>quite a community</a>. You’ll chat with Oliver about your experience and your thoughts on particular topics, build&nbsp;a simple app,&nbsp;and meet the team on video conference. If both parties feel comfortable, we’ll then give you an offer to join us. The whole process takes place over the course of around 10 days, in your own time.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role. Please start your application with the words ‘I breathe semicolons’ to show that you took your time to read all of this </p><p>Look forward to hearing from you,</p><p>The Aula team </p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://aulaeducation.recruitee.com/o/fullstack-javascript-developer-reactnodejs' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Aula</h3>            <div><p>Aula is a communication platform for education. Think ‘Slack for education’: consumer tech on the front-end yet complex infrastructure on the back-end. We’ve built Aula because we believe digital learning infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning. <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>Read about our tech stack here.</a></p><p>For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and&nbsp;<a href='https://codepen.io/' rel='nofollow'>codepen</a>) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement.

There are some GitHub PRs you need to review, so you head there first. The rest of the morning goes by working on that feature for the weekly client demo tomorrow. Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop.

Kraken is trusted by hundreds of thousands of traders, institutions, and authorities across the world, from Toyko’s court-appointed trustee to Germany’s BaFin regulated Fidor Bank.

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p><p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</p><p>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p><ul><li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li><li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li><li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li><li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li><li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li><li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li><li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li></ul><p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p><p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p><p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p><p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Analytics Fire</h3>            <div><p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p><p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. Diversity drives our vibe.

Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p><strong><strong>About</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Role</strong></strong></p><p>This is a hands-on role.

Two weeks or less if we can align schedules.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>No commute!

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$100K (mid-level), $100K-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We contribute to an HRA to offset the cost of health insurance or healthcare expenses.</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

Accordingly, the reputation of Level 12 and the character of our employees is of utmost importance. You <strong>do not</strong> need to share our leadership's religious convictions, but you will need to share our commitment to the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: honest, trustworthy, reliable, ethical.

You also work efficiently, seeking to make the best use of your time.</li><li><strong>Dedicated</strong>: you really desire to contribute to and improve our company; you are not just earning a paycheck.

You use all resources at your disposal in an efficient manner to troubleshoot. You know when to ask someone for help and when more effort is needed on your part.</li><li><strong>Technical Prowess</strong>: you just “get” programming, computers, technology. The thought of solving a problem in an entirely new programming language, one you have never even heard of before, excites you.</li><li><strong>Technical Diversity</strong>: while we all have our preferences when it comes to programming languages or operating systems, you should be willing to work with anything, in any language, if that’s what it takes to get the job done. If you are easily lead into a “______ rocks, everything else sucks” mentality, this isn’t the job for you.</li><li><strong>Flexible</strong>: we are small, things change. You should be able to “roll with the punches.”</li><li><strong>Professional</strong>: at the end of the day, you like what you do, you take your job seriously, you do it extremely well, and you <strong>pay attention to the details</strong>!</li></ul><p><strong>Senior Developer<br></strong></p><p>The candidate for the Senior Developer position will usually have 6-10 years relevant experience and meet the following requirements:</p><ol><li>Technical Skills<ul><li>Are able to write modular, well-tested, and maintainable code</li><li>Know a software development domain really well and radiate that knowledge to our team and beyond</li><li>Are able to work on multiple projects as needed</li></ul></li><li>Leadership<ul><li>Leads the design for customer projects with feedback from other engineers</li><li>Proposes new ideas for improving the development team, customer projects, and/or our tech stack</li><li>Adheres to and promotes our <a href='https://level12.io/blog/development-mission-statement/' rel='nofollow'>development culture and mission</a></li><li>For Team Leads (see below): invests in other team members to see that they are growing as individuals and to facilitate productivity within our team.</li></ul></li><li>Code quality<ul><li>Leaves code in substantially better shape than before</li><li>Fixes bugs/regressions quickly</li><li>Monitors overall code quality/build failures</li><li>Creates tests religiously and makes sure the rest of the team is doing the same</li><li>Proactively identifies and reduces technical debt</li><li>Proactively defines and solves important architectural issues</li></ul></li><li>Communication<ul><li>Provides thorough and timely code feedback for peers</li><li>Able to communicate clearly on technical topics</li><li>Keeps issues up-to-date with progress</li><li>Helps guide other merge requests to completion</li><li>Helps with recruiting</li><li>Is able to manage conversations directly with customer contacts when needed.</li></ul></li><li>Performance &amp; Scalability<ul><li>Excellent at writing production-ready code with little assistance</li><li>Able to write complex code that can scale with a significant number of users</li><li>Avoids premature optimization</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Mid-Level Developers<br></strong></p><p>The candidate for the Mid-Level Developer position will usually have 3-6 years relevant experience and meet some but not all of the requirements listed above for senior developers.</p><p><strong>Leadership<br></strong></p><p>In addition to the leadership expectations noted above, some of our senior developers will also be involved in leading other developers and interacting with customers.

You’ll be an integral part of our engineering team focused on building and scaling a world-class product.</p><p>We do things a little differently here at Knack, and that’s just how we like it:</p><p>* Flat: we don’t have project managers or dictates from a CTO. Each engineer is lead on multiple projects and is expected to make major decisions.<br>* Autonomous: our engineers own their projects, collectively determine technical implementation, and have the freedom to define how they can maximize their impact.<br>* Engaged: our engineers think of their job as more than just 1s and 0s. Only by engaging with our product, our customers, and our team can they be fully equipped to do their best work.<br>* Remote: to make this work our engineers are great communicators and are highly involved with hangouts/chat/discussions around both engineering topics and larger company issues.</p><p>This isn’t for everyone, but for the right fit this will be the definitive experience of your career. Our goal will be to ensure you are driven and supported to continuously grow and do your best work.</p><p>This is a senior position, so we’re looking for a strong track record of shipping code and building products at scale. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>About the Job</p><p>Our senior engineers are ultimately responsible for delivering an outstanding product. This includes:<br>* Implementing and architecting new features.<br>* Optimizing our systems for performance, including speed, reliability, redundancy, and geographic distribution.<br>* Fixing bugs and issues.<br>* Working with our success team to address customer issues and concerns.<br>* Building tools and processes to improve our operations and help us detect and respond to issues.</p><p>How you’ll do this:</p><p>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our current engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*Our stack*</p><p>AWS - we’ve drunk the kool-aid and use AWS across the board.<br>Node.js - APIs<br>MongoDB, Redis, MariaDB - data persistence<br>Vue.js, Backbone - our front-end is largely raw JavaScript/jQuery/Backbone, currently migrating to Vue.js.<br>Github, Jenkins, Webpack - deployment<br>Ghost Inspector, Sentry, LogRocket - testing</p><p>*About You*</p><p>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.</p><p>*About Knack*</p><p>Knack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data.</p><p>Knack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we’ve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*</p><p>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. </p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p></div>",

It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our small engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*About You*<br>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You’re an outstanding communicator. You can document a problem, and clearly and succinctly outline a solution. You’re not afraid to distill things into plain English for teammates and customers.</p><p>You have experience working in fast-paced environments, prioritizing and balancing multiple projects, and working with cross-functional teams.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.</p><p>*About Knack*<br>Knack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data.</p><p>Knack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we’ve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>So why are we different?</p><p>We’re bootstrapped: we’ve had to build something our customers actually pay for. This changes how you do things.</p><p>We’re 100% remote: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.</p><p>We’re small: and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars-- we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.</p><p>We enjoy the journey: we’re in this for the long haul. We’re not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We’re building something we’re proud of and want to keep improving on.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*<br>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It’s not about separation, it’s about optimization.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You’ll get forced days off for birthdays and knackiversaries.</p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p><p>Please note that we are only considering applicants legally eligible to work in the US.</p></div>",

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.<br>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. Thats a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.<br><br> <br>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, FT, Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Australian Herald to name a few. Hundreds of thousands of families have downloaded the RoosterMoney app since our launch in January 2016.

You have a passion for UX and UI, best practice development and building a product that delights users on a daily basis, taking pride in shipping quality code that is easy to test, maintain and build on. You care deeply about building applications with well thought out architecture.<br><br><br> Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node APIs where required.<br><br><br>We are a small team so its important that the successful candidate isnt just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.<br><br><br>Apply if you want to:<br> * Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.<br> * Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.<br> * Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.<br> * Develop robust deployment and testing processes <br> * Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.<br> <br><br><br>Benefits<br><br>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> <br> * Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.<br> * 25 days holiday<br> * Pension Scheme<br> * Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.<br> * We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office. We run a Remote working structure as a team (we currently have team members in London, Bristol and Stoke in the UK and Barcelona, Spain) so time zone variance (and travel distance) has to be sensible. <br> <br><br><br><br>We can't offer visa sponsorship at this time. <p>See more jobs at <span>Roostermoney</span></p></div></div>",

    "content": "_About SpeechKit_    <br /><br />SpeechKit is a fast-growing audio-as-a-service product for news publishers. We are building a complete toolkit to assist in the production, distribution and monetisation of audio content that will help digital news publishers reach new audiences and engage existing subscribers.<br /><br />Our business is reaching an inflection point and we are quickly onboarding new publishers by the day. This business is quickly evolving into an exciting new provider of a brand new format of news.<br /><br />We are a lean team in a phase of consolidation. This is an opportunity to join an early stage business in a high growth market providing the first of its kind service.<br /><br />_The Role_<br /><br />We are looking for a mid-level engineer with experience in leading a team in building B2B Saas products. Whilst the role is for the lead engineer in our team, we are looking for a candidate that not only has experience across our stack but also shows a willingness and enthusiasm to lead our product development through this exciting phase. <br /><br />The role will involve, but not be limited to, the following; <br /><br />* Helping define the product roadmap alongside CEO and COO.<br />* Ownership and responsibility for technical product development.<br />* Hands-on technical development across the stack.<br />* Leadership and management of the technical team.<br /><br />We currently rely heavily on contractual work for the majority of our development. It will be your job to transition from this model and lay the foundations for a team capable of sustaining our growth through the following years.<br /><br />_Core technology stack experience:_<br /><br />* Ruby on Rails 5.<br />* Python (RSS/URL text extraction).<br />* PHP (WordPress plugin development).<br />* Javascript, HTML, CSS.<br />* PostgreSQL.<br />* ELK (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana).<br />* AWS, DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, Heroku.<br /><br />_What would make you stand out;_<br /><br />* Experience and interest in machine learning and speech synthesis.<br />* Google NLP API expertise.<br />* Audio encoding know-how (ffmpeg and HLS).<br />* Background in statistics.<br />* Voice/sound design experience.<br />* Experience with media players and advertising standards e.g., VAAST and DAAST.<br />* Experience with smart speaker technology e.g., Alexa and Google Home.<br />* Mobile SDK development.<br />* React Native.<br /><br />_More about SpeechKit_<br /><br />We are a young team who have been chasing a vision for on-the-go audio news for the best part of a decade. The two founders have 10 years experience running startups between them and Speechkit is an evolution of two previous startups that has moulded a business we believe to have hit a sweet spot in an emerging market. <br /><br />We launched an MVP product in March this year and have experienced 30% growth month-on-month since that launch. We are now entering a phase of consolidation of the product, marketing and business process to ensure steady growth into the next phase of the business. <br /><br />We are well funded and ready to scale the team and business to mirror our growth prospects. Currently, we are working semi-remote and will be taking office space in mid-September. This role will be location flexible, meaning you will, for the most part, be able to manage your time working from the location of your choice or have a desk at the office. <br /><br />_Salary and Perks_<br /><br />This is an opportunity to join a dynamic and exciting business at its inception. We are looking to at a base salary for this role of £65,000 and will make judgements on an increase if expertise expands into relevant fields. Share options will also be negotiated after 3 months of the role. Holiday will start at 25 days, with flexible working location conditions. We will endeavour to meet any other suggestions you have for the role and its rewards.",

Now we’re building an ambitious language distribution platform and set of tools so that coders can focus on coding and spend less time worrying about dependency hell, third party vulnerabilities, and inconsistent developer environments.  We’re doing this for every language and platform on the planet (and beyond). We need your help to do it! Best of all you’ll be working on a product that you’ll use yourself daily.</p><p>This position is located in our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC.  However, this position is also open to full-time telecommuters anywhere in North America. </p><p>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING</p><p>Your job is to help us build the tools that take the pain out of developing code in teams. Our lofty goal is to replace the venerable README file with a single command. You’ll work on SaaS applications and command line clients and more. While a primary amount of your job will be described as back-end work you must be comfortable messing around with the front-end as well.</p><p>When not working on code, you’ll be meeting with your team to figure out priorities, features, technical issues, etc. You’re someone with good technical knowledge who also has an interest in the end-product you’ll be building.</p><p>Our day to day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development with Pivotal Tracker as our project management tool. We’re always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so.</p><p>We’re a polyglot company and embrace using the best language for the given task at hand. You’ll regularly find Golang, Elm, Javascript, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, DCOS, CircleCI, and other modern tools. Quality is as important as speed. We’re building for the long run, so you’ll need to be proficient in writing tests and documentation too.</p><p>Our back ends and command line tools for interacting with our Platform are written in Go. Experience with Go is mandatory. The front end is written in Elm. Knowledge of Elm, while prefered, is not a prerequisite. We’ve found engineers with experience in React/Redux take to the language quite naturally.</p><p>The team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Highfive for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and the Google Suite.</p><p>We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code.</p><p>WORKING AT ACTIVESTATE</p><p>ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We’re all about working together to find the best solutions, and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all of us.</p><p>Our company is a team of 35+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles including software development and QA. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we’re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events.</p><p>Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly don’t lack for ambition! But even though we’re ambitious we don’t expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches.</p><p>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU</p><p>Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up.The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people.The chance to work on a project that will change the work lives of developers around the world.Competitive salary, bonus, and stock option plan.Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program.</p><p>REQUIREMENTS</p><p>Plenty of experience with Go.Experience with relational database (mysql, postgres, ..).Adequate knowledge of JavaScript and front end development.Good working knowledge of Docker.Experience building both web based and desktop based software.Experience with all 3 major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).The ability to write clean, well-tested code with clear documentation.Decent knowledge of cloud infrastructure.Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical. You’ll need to work closely with your developer teammates, as well as be able to have coherent conversations with people from QA, sales, marketing, and other parts of the company.A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company.The ability to help others on the team become better at their jobs through mentoring, thoughtful code reviews, and generally being a team player.</p><p>ASSETS</p><p>If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter:</p><p>Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI.Javascript tooling such as Webpack and frameworks such as React and Redux.Elm code, especially large Single Page Apps.Microservices and message queues.Docker, Mesos, DCOS, Kubernetes.Functional programming languages.Experience Creating parsers, compilers or code intelligence systemsDeep understanding Process management on Window or Unix environmentsWork with reactive, event based systemsLow level architecture (sockets, primitive data types like in C) and the ability to interface and interact with low level libraries (e.g. debuggers).</p><p>We are committed to creating a welcoming environment for everyone at ActiveState and we welcome applicants from all walks of life.</p><p>Even if you don’t feel you meet every exact requirement, we still would love to hear from you and why you think you would be an awesome addition to our team and we encourage you to apply.</p>        </div>        <h4>To Apply</h4>        <p>Please submit your contact info, resume, and a cover letter to <span><span>apply-9105</span> [at] <span>functionaljobs [dot] com</span></span>.

We build several platforms for web and mobile, for several organisations ranging from start-ups to well known brands.</p><h4>About the role</h4><p>You might be wanting to step up from a more junior role, or just fancy a change. You might be working in a larger company and… well, be a little bored? Here you won’t be bored; it’s a fast paced and varied environment, where you’ll be trying new technologies and applying them to solve the interesting challenges our clients present.</p><p>You’ll know your craft inside out, but we’ll support your never ending quest to autonomously learn new skills. We like trying new things out in our studio projects. We’re a small company so you’ll have a real say in how we operate. It’s time for you to step up!</p><p>Oh… and we ALL make the tea…</p><h4>Technically ticking the boxes</h4><p><b>You’ll need to be nailing these:</b></p><ul><li>Javascript including ES6 &amp; Node. We use React.js &amp; React Native, and you’ll need to hit the ground running with this. But if your experience is in Angular or VUE.js then that’s good with us – it’s equally valid!</li><li>HTML5 and CSS</li><li>Pre-compilers like SASS, LESS, and bundlers like Grunt, Gulp &amp; Webpack</li><li>GIT</li></ul><p><b>These will massively help your application</b>:</p><ul><li>Working knowledge of other server side &amp; database technologies, such as JAVA (Spring MVC / Spring Boot). We’ve traditionally been a PHP/JAVA/MySQL house – but you can have experience in others.</li><li>Experience in using API based backend services such as Google Firebase, or NoSQL architecture like MongoDB.</li><li>Photoshop/Illustrator/Sketch – we don’t expect you to be an experienced UI designer but you’ll need to appreciate the importance of good design and UI.</li><li>CMS Builds. As a company we offer so much more but we do still do our fair share of WordPress/Contentful builds &amp; similar. A ‘need to know’ around a CMS of your choice is useful.</li></ul><h4>Benefits</h4><p>We understand that different people like different things so we don’t have an official ‘rewards package’… if you want something… ask!</p><p>That said, we offer:<br></p><ul><li>25 days holiday (plus the normal 8 days bank holiday)</li><li>Flexible working hours (we’re a task based organisation)</li></ul><ul></ul><p><b>So - if you think you can step up to the plate and become Spork's new prong, then get in touch! Send through your CVs, portfolios, repository details or whatever you have to jobs@wearespork.net.</b></p>",

We are at a stage where our interest lies in finding founding team members. We will happily expose you to strategy, planning and the entire foundation of the business if and when required.</p><p>The right person is not afraid to shake things up or speak up when needed. They will stand their ground when they know they are right, and learn from it when they are wrong. </p><p>Technical skills are important, but making sure everyone in the team gets along is even more. We work in a distributed environment, so working alone, using technology for discussions and managing your own time are added challenges you will have to deal with.</p><p>Now, we also realise that these kind of people don’t just turn up out of the blue. So we are always on the lookout and are planning to grow based on people, not hire based on growth. In return, you must be committed, and anything measured in months will be considered insufficient.</p><p>Finally; if your only goal in life is to make a difference and genuinely help wineries, you really should get in touch.

    "content": "<h3>  React Developer</h3>  <p><b>Location: London or Melbourne</b></p><p><b>Why you should join us</b></p><p>We’ve built up a team of outstanding and passionate people, and we work hard to keep them. Of course there’s plenty of flexibility and lots of opportunities to grow, but we also have share options, private health insurance, and unlimited leave (with a minimum of 5.6 weeks per year - just so everyone actually takes time off). Our CEO is (really) devoted to making Rotageek the best place to work, and so while we work really, really hard, we definitely play hard, too. And we have nice snacks, good beer, amazing team events and a roof terrace.</p><p><b>Your role</b></p><p>We're looking&nbsp;for an experienced JavaScript developer who is proficient with React.js. You’ll be responsible for developing new user-facing features and implementing them following well-known React.js workflows (such as Redux). You will ensure that these components and the overall application are robust, reusable and easy to maintain coordinating with the rest of the team working on different layers of the infrastructure. A commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design, and product quality is important.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rotageek</b></p><p>A few years ago, Rotageek was a small side project; our CEO, an A&amp;E doctor, wanted to improve scheduling in his hospital department. Today, we’re a software company leading the way in reinventing how employees are scheduled. </p><p>We’re helping some of the largest UK organisations move from paper and excel based rotas to intelligent and interactive schedules. In doing so, we’re helping employees gain more ownership over their hours - improving their work-life balance - whilst making sure that businesses improve how they run their operations. We use intelligent technology to make sure the right staff are in the right place at the right time, whilst making the process of creating, communicating and modifying a rota as easy as possible.</p> <p><b>What we expect from our developers</b><br></p><ul><li>You have outstanding software development skills. You write clean, maintainable and technically sound code.</li><li>As part of the development team, you’re responsible for the scalability, security and performance of the platform. This responsibility underlines all of your work and it plays on repeat in your head whilst you code away.</li><li>You really want to build something new. You’re confident in suggesting new and brave ideas, technologies and ways of working.</li><li>You’re super eager, want to learn new technologies and get knee-deep in all areas of the code: front-end, back-end, mobile apps.</li><li>You’re happy to communicate clearly with both techy people as well as the wider business. Meaning you can explain things and not sound like you’re talking about quantum gravity.</li><li>You’re cool with documenting complex processes where needed. We try really hard to keep this to a minimum, but when it must be done it must be done and that’s that.</li></ul><p><b>As the ideal candidate, you have...</b></p><ul><li>A strong proficiency in JavaScript, including DOM manipulation and the JavaScript object model</li><li>A thorough understanding of React.js and its core principles</li><li>Experience with popular React.js workflows (such as Redux)</li><li>Experience with TypeScript</li><li>Familiarity with RESTful APIs</li><li>Familiarity with modern front-end build pipelines and tools</li><li>Experience with tools like Babel, Webpack, NPM, etc.</li><li>Ability to understand business requirements and translate them into technical requirements</li><li>Familiarity with code versioning tools in Git (Bitbucket)</li><li>Experience with mobile app development using React Native (advantageous but not essential)</li></ul><p><b>Apply!</b><br></p><p>If you think this sounds like something you'd enjoy and excel at, we would love to hear from you!&nbsp;</p><p>To apply, please send us your CV and a short paragraph explaining why you think you’d make a great React Developer to claire@rotageek.com.</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p> <p>(We’re not looking to work with recruiters for this job posting so please only contact us if you’re a candidate wishing to apply - thank you!)</p>",

We are made of many small teams that are broadly distributed across the US, featuring tightly collaborative groups of developers, designers, and product managers constantly encouraging each other to deliver work that instills pride and fulfillment.<br><br>Our developers are organized into a network of small teams with embedded product managers, designers, and front-end specialists focused on specific functional areas. &nbsp;We believe deeply in automated testing, code review, and iterative improvement.

Engineers exchange code reviews with other team members, provide mentorship to junior engineers, and assist QA and Ops in troubleshooting product issues.<br><br>Our primary backend platform is based on Python and Django and is supported by PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, and Solr. We also utilize Ruby on Rails in some key applications. Many of our applications and services are dockerized and deployed into Kubernetes clusters by Jenkins.

We desire developers who treat automated tests as essential, and believe that code reviews are a crucial path of learning and of sharing knowledge.

Your work will empower over 8,000 businesses around the world to provide great customer service, and will support other senior engineers on your team.</div><div><h3>Tools we use:</h3></div><ul><li>PHP 7.x</li><li>Lumen, Laravel, Symfony Console, and a custom PHP framework</li><li>Modular and functional CSS with&nbsp;<a href='https://developer.helpscout.com/seed/' rel='nofollow'>Help Scout Seed</a></li><li>React, Redux, Backbone.js, Marionette.js</li><li>Webpack, Babel, and ES6</li><li>Component-based design systems with&nbsp;<a href='https://github.com/helpscout/blue' rel='nofollow'>Help Scout Blue</a></li><li>RabbitMQ</li><li>Redis</li><li>Pusher</li><li>Java(APIs)</li><li>MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB</li></ul><div><h3>About the role</h3></div><ul><li>The engineering team currently has thirty-seven talented engineers. On a typical day you may help a customer with an issue, work on a new feature, create a third party integration or enhance back-end tools. On any given project, you will be communicating with internal APIs, integrating with 3rd party services, optimizing processes using Redis, RabbitMQ and various AWS services, and wrapping it all up in support of a Backbone/Marionette or React front end.</li><li>Our engineering teams work in two-week iterations, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/agile-remote-teams/' rel='nofollow'>remote, agile development</a>. When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with test cases and tag your team for review(often over a video and screen-sharing session).</li><li>We have invested heavily in local Docker development and cloud-based continuous integration and delivery so you can get setup fast and your development branch can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our top-notch in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li><li>Everything is secondary to the&nbsp;<i>customer experience</i>. We expect you to have a keen sense of how your code will impact the experience in terms of performance, security and usability.</li><li>You'll be working with product people that challenge you to get better every day. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy work that moves the needle for businesses around the world.</li></ul><div><h3>About you</h3></div><ul><li>You are very experienced with modern PHP development practices and open source frameworks. You’ve worked on these sorts of projects at scale and feel confident solving complex problems. You view “best practices” as a starting point for critical thinking, rather than a dogma to follow.</li><li>You have created Backbone (or a similar framework) single page applications before and can write JavaScript from scratch to implement a feature. Marionette and/or React experience is a bonus, but not required. We can help you pick it up.</li><li>Your code is not only reliable and performant for customers, but can be read, maintained and understood easily by other engineers on your team. The&nbsp;<a href='https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/' rel='nofollow'>Zen of Python</a>&nbsp;resonates with you for any language.</li><li>You believe in writing unit and integration tests and have at least tried TDD. You like owning the quality of the code you write — QA doesn’t mean throwing it over the wall for someone else to test. You understand that some things are too costly to automate and must be manually tested to get it right.</li><li>You take pride in your work and ownership of the solutions you build. When a team member or customer is in need, you feel a sense of urgency to understand their pain and thoughtfully help.</li><li>You are curious and constantly learning. Believing that “a rising tide lifts all ships,” you make everyone around you better sharing what you have learned and looking for ways to improve both yourself and the team.</li><li>You enjoy the finish work and detail required to deliver a rich product with exceptional UX. From UI interactions to handling important edge cases, you take satisfaction in delivering a solid experience that delights the users, adds value to the business, and lasts over time.</li><li>You are a humble professional who wants to be challenged by the work and not the workload. You are willing to ask for help when necessary and unafraid to say, “I don’t know.” At the same time, you have the confidence to take on complex and challenging problems.</li><li>You are proactive about solving problems and improving things. You take the initiative to build tools and processes that will help everyone. When working in the codebase, you leave things better than you found them.</li><li>You are an excellent communicator who can write and speak with empathy for our customers and team. You can easily communicate complex ideas to both technical and non-technical audiences. Clear communication is super important in a remote culture like ours.</li><li>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea. You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.</li><li>You can work anywhere in the world as long as you have 4+ hours of overlap time with Boston, MA (9AM - 6PM ET).</li></ul><div><h3>Benefits</h3></div><ul><li><span>Competitive Salary</span>&nbsp;- We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well.

    "content": "<p>We’re looking for a smart and ambitious Front End Developer who wants to crush code and leave a legacy within the National Health Service. Sound intriguing? Read on....</p><h4><b>ABOUT MESSLY</b></h4><p>Our vision is to revolutionise medical training and recruitment within the NHS. We believe that the digital infrastructure supporting the training and recruitment of NHS doctors isn’t fit for purpose. If you know anything about the NHS, you won’t need convincing. The NHS is on it’s knees lurching from one workforce crisis to the next.</p><h4><b>WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?</b></h4><p>Messly's vision is to be the online home for all UK doctors - a single digital platform providing doctors with unified training resources and data, peer-peer connectivity and recruitment services across the whole of the NHS. By bringing all the doctors to one place, we can provide the NHS with world-class digital infrastructure to directly engage with the medical workforce for temporary and permanent work, skipping the agencies and enabling game-changing financial savings.</p><p>Yes this sounds lofty and ambitious. But let’s be clear, this isn’t a passion project to keep our minds whirring after a dull night shift. Here’s why we are fully committed and extremely confident that we can make this happen:</p><h4>1. OUR TRACTION AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY</h4><p>We’re already delivering - over the last 18 months we’ve built a medical network of over 10,000 doctors and medical students. That’s 15% of the junior medical workforce. We’ve got 6 NHS Trusts using our recruitment services and are generating revenue. Our business model is proven and scalable and we have clear roadmap of how we’re going to win over the hearts and minds of doctors.</p><h4>2. OUR TEAM</h4><p>We strongly believe a solid team is critical for success. So we’ve gone out and built a crack team of clinicians, developers, designers, commercial experts and marketeers. Our founders are close-friends with significant medical and commercial experience. Our tech team are rockstar coders with incredible design flair. Our ops are run by an ex-Amazon whiz. Supporting our troops are an advisory board made up of some of the most well-connected entrepreneurs and healthcare experts, who are helping to embed Messly within the healthcare ecosystem. We’ve been backed by all leading healthcare innovation hubs including DigitalHealth.London, NHS Clinical Entrepreneurs Programme and InnovateUK.</p><h4>3. OUR FUNDING</h4><p>We’ve raised over £1,000,000 to focus on building the best digital tools and services for our doctors and NHS. Quite simply we can more patient and long-term than anyone else in the market to realise our bold vision.</p><h4>THE ROLE</h4><p>We're looking to hire a smart, curious, and enthusiastic front end developer who wants to make a name for themselves by building something something extraordinarily beautiful and functional. There'll be a lot of greenfield coding opportunities and you'll have the opportunity to retain full ownership of your code.</p><p>We're a young company, so you'll need to get your hands dirty and no two weeks will be the same. You will, of course, need to define your own work proactively and take ownership of the outputs. The ability to cope with uncertainty and rapid change is crucial.</p><p>We have a very flat hierarchy - you'll be working directly with our founders and CTO.</p><h4>ABOUT YOU</h4><p>You're smart, ambitious, like a challenge and are looking to move into a very rapidly growing startup order to fast-track your career. You're frustrated by slow-moving, process-heavy situations and excited by moving fast to solve challenging problems and delight customers. You'd like the opportunity to work in a varied role with responsibility and the scope for rapid personal development and change.</p><h4>REQUIREMENTS:</h4><p>1 or more years experience of JS front end development.</p><p>Experience developing with React.JS.</p><p>Knowledge of CSS and HTML.</p><p>UX/UI experience - including responsive/mobile design.</p><p>Portfolio of existing work to discuss.</p><h4>DESIRABLE TRAITS:</h4><p>Familiarity with functional programming.</p><h4>BENEFITS</h4><p>Highly competitive salary (based on experience) as well as other incentives where appropriate.</p><p>Very flexible working</p><p>Travel / development expenses.</p><p>Not one but two part-time office dogs.</p><p>Free (and frankly pretty good) barista coffee.</p><p>The role is full-time. Our offices are based in South West London, but we're open to flexible working as suits you and the role you'd like to create. Full-time remote working is an option - including for individuals who are based outside of the UK.</p>",

We help thousands of stores surprise and delight their customers with automated emails that drive sales. We’re looking for a smart, detail-oriented person to join our team as our first front-end engineer.<br><br>**The Role**<br><br>You’ll work closely with your teammates on the engineering team (Justin, Lucas, Hannes, Dani, and Jonathan) to create intuitive &amp; engaging interfaces based on direction from the product team (Beka). While Jilt is built as a traditional Ruby/Rails app, we use Angular (v1) to power our visual email editor and Vue.js for some areas with a lot of dynamic content. You’ll work on both areas and help engineer an incredible user experience.<br><br>While the majority of your time will be spent focused on the app front-end, we have some features that are powered by JavaScript running on our customer’s stores. This means you’ll be able to flex your defensive programming skills and ensure our code works in harmony with a wide variety of browsers and other 3rd party scripts.<br><br>As our first dedicated front-end engineer, the team will often look to you for advice and direction. You’ll help shape our best practices, decide on frameworks and tooling, and refactor older or underperforming parts of the codebase. You’ll also be responsible for moving your projects forward, communicating your progress and milestones with others, and clearly documenting your work.<br><br>**Here are some things you may do on a given day:**<br><br>- Write some new JavaScript (with unit tests ) to improve part of the onboarding flow<br>- Track down a tricky bug in the email editor and develop a hotfix<br>- Research and write a pitch to migrate our CSS to a new framework<br>- Transform the design for a new part of the UI into HTML / CSS<br><br>**On the first day you will:**<br><br>- Meet your team and get familiar with how we work<br>- Setup your local environment and tooling<br>- Commit a small tweak to the codebase and ship it to production<br><br>**In the first week you will:**<br><br>- Develop, QA, review, and ship a small feature improvement<br>- Participate in code review for a teammate’s code<br>- Help a team member with fixing a bug<br><br>**In the first month you will:**<br><br>- Work closely with the product team to ship a large feature<br>- Participate in your first support rotation week and help our support team with escalated issues<br>- Publish a retrospective on your first large project to share successes &amp; planned improvements for the next project<br><br>**You**<br><br>You love writing JavaScript that’s clear, self-documenting, and standards-compliant, whether by itself, alongside jQuery, or as part of a JS framework like Vue, Angular, or React. You believe in combining JS with beautiful &amp; semantic HTML / CSS and are comfortable with supersets like CoffeeScript and templating languages like Slim. You’re also comfortable with Ruby / Rails and can move seamlessly between working on the back-end code that produces the data you need for front-end interactions.<br><br>You love beautiful design and working with others to transform concepts into real-world interfaces that are a joy to use. You love keeping up-to-date with the latest best practices and tools, and are constantly tweaking and improving the way you work.<br><br>You’re excited to solve engineering challenges in the most pragmatic way possible, and most importantly, you keep the end user in mind and love getting feedback from customers to help improve our products.<br><br>Finally, you can’t wait to join a small team that loves their work as much as you do, affords the opportunity to work on challenging &amp; interesting projects, continuously learn and improve, and constantly ship your work. You’re an excellent writer and can communicate effectively whether drafting up a bug report, chatting in Slack, or editing a wiki page. You know that code is about communication and explaining your thought process clearly goes hand-in-hand.<br><br>Our team is fully remote and stays in touch primarily via Slack and weekly check-ins over Zoom. That said, we believe spending time together is important — availability for 1-2 company-paid [team trips](https://jilt.com/blog/remote-team-retreat-2018/) per year is necessary.<br><br>This is a full-time, salaried position, but hours are flexible. We know your work will speak for itself with commits, issues closed, and wiki edits.<br><br>**Here are some benefits we're happy to offer to our team members:**<br><br>- Competitive salary<br>- Annual incentive for meeting team and company goals<br>- 27 days of paid time-off, in addition to 2 company holidays (SkyVerge Day in March, Founders Day in June )<br>- Medical, Dental, and Vision insurance for US and Canadian residents and their families (reimbursements for comparable care for non-US/Canadian residents)<br>- 401k/RRSP Retirement plan with 4% company match for US/Canadian residents (contributions to comparable plans for non-US/Canadian residents)<br>- 8 weeks paid parental leave for new mothers and fathers<br>- Work flexible hours from anywhere that has a reliable internet connection<br>- Tools (hardware/software) to help you be productive<br>- Allowance for professional growth (books, courses, conferences)<br>- Home office or co-working allowance<br>- A Kindle to help you keep learning<br><br>*We support workplace diversity and do not discriminate on any protected class.

Please take the time to read this and thoughtfully consider if we would be a good fit for one another. This is a full-time position. You must be located in Florida and be able to interact in person with our team in Clearwater, FL. No contractors or agencies. Seriously. </span></p><p></p><p><span>Why We Started Guardian Trust</span></p><p><span>Guardian Trust was created for the sole purpose of helping people with disabilities financially qualify for public assistance programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). </span></p><p><span>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is hefty, and we accomplish it by leveraging technology and hiring the best.</span></p><p><span>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</span></p><p><span>The development shop we’ve partnered with over the last few years, Very, is a remote-first company, and we’ve fully embraced this concept alongside them. About 30% of the Very dev team works out of HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. &nbsp;Currently, the Guardian Trust staff works full-time in Clearwater, FL. However, we see the benefit of remote work and welcome engineers who would like to work mostly remote. We ask that from time to time you come to the office to work directly with our staff using our trust management software. Especially in the beginning, we feel it’s essential to fully understand our workflows and advise on system improvement. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>What You’ll Be Working On</span></p><p><span>Guardian in collaboration with Very, has built custom web-based CRM software to manage back-office workflows and the day-to-day operations of Trust management. You will have the opportunity to shape and grow the user experience to facilitate intuitive and efficient use. The web application integrates with a robust accounting system as well as a check-writing service. There is a strong focus on availability in the face of degraded performance from integrations. As such, you will be able to leverage the strengths of Elixir to continue providing a high-quality experience as part of the Guardian team.</span></p><ul><li><span>Elixir (Phoenix)</span></li><li><span>JavaScript (React)</span></li><li><span>Redis</span></li><li><span>Postgres</span></li><li><span>AWS</span></li><li><span>Heroku</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This Role: Senior Software Engineer</span></p><p><span>Your job will be to not only add on to our platform, but also to listen to the team using it and make continuous recommendations for improvement. While the Guardian Trust team doesn’t have a degree in programming, they truly understand leveraging smart software and taking care of their customers. </span></p><p><span>We’ve got lofty goals for growth— striving to help as many people with disabilities as possible. As a Senior Software Engineer at Guardian Trust, we expect you to not only bring a high level of programming expertise, but also a high-level of product ownership. We value collaboration, as well as exceptional communication with the ability to distill complex ideas in layman’s terms. We also value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineer to be as good a practitioner as they are a leader and teacher. </span></p><p><span>When you start working at Guardian, you’ll pair with our development partner, Very, to learn the ropes of the product and code-base, third-party integrations, deployment, business decisions, etc. Very will continue to be part of the code review process to ensure Guardian is well taken care of—and you’re set up for success.</span></p><p><span>How We Operate</span></p><p><span>We emphasize that outstanding people providing excellent service are the key to our success. We expect our employees to be careful and conscientious in their performance of duties, thoughtful and considerate of other people and courteous and helpful when dealing with other employees. We encourage our employees to improve proficiency in their respective jobs and to participate in continuing education opportunities that are relevant to their position.</span></p><p><span>Our standard workweek is Monday - Friday, and our office is open between the hours of 8:30 am and 5:00&nbsp;pm. </span></p><p><span>How You’ll Be Compensated</span></p><p><span>We believe in fair compensation, depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $120,000 annually upon joining the company. We have an excellent health plan available to our employees, and we cover 100% of the cost of the premium for our employee and their families. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a maximum of a 3% match based upon the percentage you contribute. </span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>How To Apply</span></p><p><span>This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in Florida. Thanks!</span></p><p><span>To apply, please send us a note to <a href='mailto:jobs-gt@verypossible.com' rel='nofollow'>jobs-gt@verypossible.com</a> with {{Guardian Trust Engineer}} in the subject line. Please include the following:</span></p><ol><li><span>What’s most important to you from a company culture and operating environment?</span></li><li><span>What are the biggest things that de-motivate you and make you unhappy when it comes to being an independent engineer within a company?</span></li><li><span>Your resume</span></li><li><span>Code samples with comments explaining what you did and how you architected the code.</span></li></ol><p></p>  </div>",

We are a growing team of 6 passionate people with plans to expand rapidly by the end of 2018.<br><br>With multiple new product launches on the horizon and several more planned before the end of the year, you will be joining the company at a time of explosive growth. Your presence will have a very real impact on the company’s value.<br><br>We are looking for a Frontend Web Developer to join our tech team’s efforts to supercharge our PHP web application. You will be working directly with Pierre-Camille, our founder, who developed the original product from scratch, as well as with all members of the tech, marketing, and success teams.<br><br>Our company is fully distributed and remote. We believe and fully embrace that your best environment is wherever you - personally - feel the most productive and comfortable for day-to-day work. Nevertheless, we organise frequent meetups and retreats for the team to physically meet throughout the year. The last two trips were to Lisbon/Cascais and Paris!<br><br><br><br>⭐️ **What you will do: **⭐️<br><br>• You will be our web app’s interior designer.<br><br>• You will be responsible both for our public site’s and the web app’s frontend code, through layout, elegant presentation, visual functionality, and compatibility across a wide range of browser versions and form factors.<br><br>• You will be in charge of completely overhauling our legacy, spaghetti frontend javascript into a unified, beautifully-structured, and testable web app.<br><br>• You will take charge of your own work and proactively suggest improvements.<br><br>• In a remote environment you will be responsible for your own time and results – there will be no babysitting.<br><br><br><br>✅ **What you will need to succeed:** ✅<br><br>• UX Geek: you know how to strike the right balance between swanky animation and Zen-like simplicity to drive great user experiences.<br><br>• Independent: you are self-motivated, take initiative, and are a strong communicator. You are results-driven and willing to learn and improve yourself.<br><br>• Technical Ninja: proficient at vanilla Javascript and PHP, Vue.js 2.x or Angular 4/5/6, Twig/Blade/Handlebars templating, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3 (all the good stuff), semantic/schema markup, LESS/SCSS, Webpack and/or Gulp, and Git, backed by 5+ years of frontend development experience.<br><br>• Interface Artisan: you can clearly describe data structure requirements as well as points of entry for your frontend code, enabling other developers to integrate their frontend and backend code painlessly.<br><br>• Caring Developer: you recognise that your code and work impact not only the customers but also the rest of the team. You conduct yourself with professionalism and respect not only in meetings but also in how you structure your code and in the documentation that you write.<br><br>• Superb English fluency: we are an international team and clear communication is vital. It goes without saying (but we’ll say it anyway) that you absolutely must have the ability to participate in frequent video meetings.<br><br>• The product team is based in Europe, so at the moment we are looking for developers who are based within the same general time zones (UTC±3). <br><br><br><br> **Brownie points:** <br><br>• You have experience with unit and automated functionality testing of frontend code using tools like Jasmine, Karma, Chai, Selenium, PhantomJS, and/or Sinon.<br><br>• Interactive Git rebasing doesn’t sound like voodoo to you.<br><br>• You’ve used in Git commit messages.<br><br>• You’re pretty darn good at interface design and color palettes.<br><br>• Typescript experience.<br><br>(Let us know how many  you deserve.)<br><br><br><br> **What we offer:** <br><br>• Competitive salary, including the possibility of stock options.<br><br>• Ample paid leave, in addition to maternity and paternity leave.<br><br>• A great support structure: we are here for you.<br><br>• Flexible contract. You will work independently where you are most productive and happiest, with flexible weekday hours.<br><br>• All the resources and tools that you need to succeed <br><br>• Join a fast-growing startup and be part of the force that shapes the company in the years to come!<br><h2>Requirements</h2>We are solving global short-term rental automation.

Our platform enables customers to acquire real-time industry-standard quotes for repairs (a first in Europe), services and diagnostics, and quickly book a vetted mechanic online. Our mission is to bring trust and transparency to car repair.<br /><br />Founded in 2012, the company has grown quickly to offer nationwide coverage and is backed by such institutional investors as 500 Startups and Forward Partners, and angel investors including the former CEO of JustEat and Chairman of Treatwell.<br /><br />Vehicle repair is a huge market, ripe for technology disruption.

Working alongside our CTO & Head of Engineering, you will deliver new features and continually improve our existing code.<br /><br />Technology underpins our entire business.

Our main app is built with Ruby (on Rails) and is hosted on Heroku and AWS. We use both PostgreSQL and SQL Server relational databases and also MongoDB and Elasticsearch NoSQL databases.<br /><br />Our mobile Mechanic App is built on JQuery mobile and we are planning to rearchitect this system onto a more modern framework (e.g. React) soon.<br /><br />Our development pipeline utilises Jira, Git, GitHub, Docker, Webpack, Grunt and CircleCI.<br /><br />*---- Requirements ----*<br /><br />Your potential is much more important to us than a list of characteristics. Nevertheless, here is a list of characteristics that we hope already apply to you, or that you’re very keen to develop:<br />* You consider yourself fairly expert in at least one OO programming language (not necessarily Ruby).<br />* You have built a production web application using an MVC (or equivalent) framework (e.g. Ruby on Rails).<br />* The terms OOP, SOLID and TDD make you feel warm inside.<br />* You can write complicated SQL statements directly in the console without a query designer.<br />* Unix, Linux, Heroku, GitHub and NoSQL are not just made-up words to you.<br />* You can describe JavaScript as a functional, prototypal language and know what that means.<br />* You have strong Git-fu and can perform interactive rebases from the command line.<br />* You’re not afraid to get stuck into DevOps and have a go at, say, implementing Docker in a CI pipeline.<br />* You write your best code when pair-programming with another developer regardless of their experience.<br />* You wouldn't write a line of production code without writing a failing test first, because that’s how it’s done, right?<br />* You read about programming and technology because it’s a passion, not just a profession.<br />* You see legacy code as an exciting opportunity to innovate and make things better.<br /><br />*---- Benefits ----*<br /><br />* Working with leading open-source technologies in an agile team.<br />* A culture that embraces flexibility, and rewards growth and innovation.<br />* The opportunity to directly contribute to the success of the business every day.<br />* A competitive package including company pension and share options.<br />* MacBook Pro as standard.<br />* 10% innovation time.<br />* Manage your own training budget.<br />* Tea, coffee, fruit, snacks and Friday beers provided!<br />* Bringing trust and transparency to an industry which is widely recognised for high levels customer dissatisfaction.",

Since then, our growth has been steady and organic, and we've built a great business with several £million in annual revenue and very healthy profits.<br /><br />A few years ago we launched Flow XO, a business messaging and chatbots product. Flow XO is already a leader in its market with users all over the world.<br /><br />**Our plan for growth**<br /><br />We're now working on a 3 year plan to accelerate our growth and bring the FLG and Flow XO products closer together.<br /><br />The foundations are there - strong history, good revenues, excellent profits, amazing people in both the team and customers.<br /><br />Our plans include a new focus on sales and marketing, and a revamped approach to product, which will see FLG and Flow XO become an expanded product family and see new products brought into the mix.<br /><br />**The role**<br /><br />As the single lead developer and coach in the team, it will be your job to work alongside the product manager to turn product plans into well architected software products.<br /><br />About half the time you'll be managing, coaching and organising the team. The rest of the time, you'll be working on code alongside the rest of the team.<br /><br />You'll be working on both the front-end (React/Redux and Angular) and also the back-end (Node, MongoDB & Redis) plus anything else we bring into the picture for our new products. The work is challenging, as we're building complex products with interesting problems around UX, scaling, and architecture.<br /><br />Although there's obviously some complexity in the codebase, we've worked hard to reduce technical debt, achieve excellent test coverage, and follow conventions where possible. So you'll be joining projects where most of the working day is spent thinking about the future rather than catching up with the past.<br /><br />Our product roadmap means there is likely to be whole new products being actively worked on every 3-6 months, at least for the next few years.<br /><br />**Is this you?**<br /><br />* You have a few years' experience of building full-stack JavaScript web apps<br />* You currently have team leadership responsibilities and want to develop that further. We need you to lead technical discussion to collaborate with the team and nurture innovation whilst always having an eye on the commercial strategy. We also need you to act as our scrum master (or delegate the responsibility elsewhere)<br />* You want to coach and develop other members of the team around you<br />* You're engaging, approachable and pragmatic<br />* You're a great communicator<br />* Always be considering 'what if', so you can write code and design logic that is robust and secure<br /><br />If this is you, please come and join our team. Our customers need you.<br /><br />**The rewards**<br /><br />This is a rare opportunity to transform something great into something incredible.<br /><br />A chance to plot the businesses growth and point proudly to when you joined the business, just before the curve takes that sharp upwards turn.<br /><br />As well as a rewarding challenge, we also offer:<br /><br />* A very competitive salary<br />* Flexible working hours<br />* Part-time remote working available<br />* Our product team is based in Manchester City Centre in a cool office. We don't care about your gender, race, sexuality, age, whether you have disabilities we need to accommodate, etc. - we're simply looking for someone that can deliver.<br /><br />**Next steps**<br /><br />The first step is to send us your current CV and write us an intro.<br /><br />The intro is important, you need to explain (succinctly) how you fit into the picture.<br /><br />We're looking forward to hearing from you. Don't delay.",

    "content": "*SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE*<br /><br />OLIO is the world’s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and our mission is to solve the problem of food waste in the home & local community. We do this by connecting anyone with spare food – which can be households or local businesses – with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away £800 of food each year - collectively adding up to £15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile & web apps. Over the past 2 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. <br /><br />We now have over 465,000 users who have together shared well over half a million portions of food – with food being successfully shared in 32 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our volunteer programme, with over 19,000 people reaching out to spread the word about OLIO in their local community and rescue unsold food.<br /><br />OLIO is now looking to grow our core team as we embark upon the next exciting phase in our journey.<br /><br />*JOIN OUR TEAM!*<br /><br />In order to accelerate OLIO to its next level in growth and impact, we are recruiting for a Data Analyst & Dashboard Developer, who will report into Viv Taylor, Product Manager.<br /><br />In this role you will be responsible for:<br /><br />* Data Analysis: Analysing key business questions in our burgeoning data via an SQL interface (both through<br />GUI and command line tools)<br />* Data Visualization: Development of a “data dashboard” for the company to help us interrogate our data<br />visually and in a user friendly manner<br />* Data Innovation: Liaison with our broader OLIO team to ensure that the right questions are being asked of<br />our growing datasets, in the right order.<br />* Data Exploration: Evaluation of the effects of specific initiatives/experiments at OLIO, generating and<br />presenting reports of their efficacy<br />* Setup of regular reports that provide insight into ongoing company/departmental performance.<br />* Assisting with online ad creative endeavours, their implementation and analysing their impact<br /><br />Once you have proven yourself you will have great freedom and autonomy, coupled with an enormous opportunity for personal development.

There’s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products you’ve already bought. It’s irritating for the end user and counterproductive for the company attempting to sell their products or services. Using our tooling marketers can refine their targeting such that the ads are only shown to people who have shown genuine interest.<br /><br />WORKING AT DRIFTROCK<br /><br />Driftrock’s tooling provides our users with a way to receive, transform, track and optimise leads from social channels. Currently these tools look and feel very separate so we’re in the process of bringing them together, with the view to having Driftrock be more of a platform than a set of tools. Other problems we’re solving, and are looking to solve in the near future, include:<br />. How to securely and safely handle personally identifying information;<br />. How to enrich incoming data with information that will help our users decide on the best next steps for their leads;<br />. What reports to provide to our users such that they can see if their efforts are resulting in quality leads and what they can do to improve.<br /><br />The technology is a mixture of Ruby, Elixir and React applications hosted on Kubernetes and Google Cloud. We make use of Redis and Postgres for data storage and RabbitMQ for event processing.<br /><br />You will be expected to:<br />. Build RESTful APIs, event-based systems and front-end applications;<br />. Work with well-known public APIs like Facebook and LinkedIn;<br />. Design and improve user experience;<br />. Support production systems;<br />. Manage cloud infrastructure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE TEAM<br /><br />We’re a small team of 15 people at Driftrock but we’re growing. Our product development team is 7 people with 6 developers and 1 CTO, this means that anyone we bring in can have a huge impact on the culture and practices of the team. <br /><br />We believe in continuous improvement and we are constantly refining and improving how we work and communicate. One of the ways we do this is by performing fortnightly retrospectives, which are often run by different team members. <br /><br />Currently we make use of daily standups and weekly prioritisation meetings to ensure we're pulling in the same direction and maintaining our focus of delivering value to our end users early and often.<br /><br />ABOUT YOU<br /><br />. You should be keen to learn and improve technical, product and personal skills;<br />. You want to be involved in crafting products whilst building on the culture and process of the product team;<br />. You are happy working in a small team, collaborating closely with other engineers as well as our product and sales teams;<br />. You can provide new and diverse viewpoints for our technical and product discussions;<br />. You are interested in agile practices such as continuous delivery, TDD, pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives;<br />. You are keen to ensure there is a high standard of quality and security in the software we produce as a team;<br />. You have had some exposure to Ruby, Elixir or Javascript (we do not expect you to have experience in all of those languages); <br />. You have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br /><br />The interview process has some flexibility but is primarily made up of the following stages:<br /><br />. An initial phone conversation with an engineer;<br />. A take home technical test/coding challenge;<br />. Followed by an on-site pairing interview, where we'll build on your code challenge solution. We then do an informal problem solving task and we finish up with an informal chat with the rest of the team;<br /><br />We try our hardest to reduce the amount of stress involved in the process, we’re not trying to catch you out with trick questions and if at any point (even on the take home test) you have any questions for us we encourage you to ask them.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />. You will work with passionate and smart people, in an environment where we firmly believe in sharing knowledge;<br />. You will be an integral part of a growing and innovative tech startup;<br />. You can be enrolled to the Company’s pension scheme;<br />. The company atmosphere is social and friendly; <br />. You will be part of fun monthly team events.<br /><br /><br />We will not be considering any recruitment agencies for this role.<br /><br />&quot;By applying for this job you hereby give us permission to store your data on our secure applicant tracking system and to contact you with regards to Driftrock Ltd and our job opportunities. We will store your data for a year before deleting all individually identifiable information.

    "content": "Location: Old Street, London N1<br /><br />Start Date: ASAP<br /><br />Salary: depending on experience and skill level<br /><br />WHO ARE DRIFTROCK?<br /><br />Driftrock was started with the aim of making advertising through social channels better. There’s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products you’ve already bought. It’s irritating for the end user and counterproductive for the company attempting to sell their products or services. Using our tooling marketers can refine their targeting such that the ads are only shown to people who have shown genuine interest.<br /><br />WORKING AT DRIFTROCK<br /><br />Driftrock’s tooling provides our users with a way to receive, transform, track and optimise leads from social channels. Currently these tools look and feel very separate so we’re in the process of bringing them together, with the view to having Driftrock be more of a platform than a set of tools. Other problems we’re solving, and are looking to solve in the near future, include:<br /><br />* How to securely and safely handle personally identifying information; <br />* How to enrich incoming data with information that will help our users decide on the best next steps for their leads; <br />* What reports to provide to our users such that they can see if their efforts are resulting in quality leads and what they can do to improve.<br /><br />The technology is a mixture of Ruby, Elixir and React applications hosted on Kubernetes and Google Cloud. We make use of Redis and Postgres for data storage and RabbitMQ for event processing.<br /><br />You will be expected to:<br /><br />* Build RESTful APIs, event-based systems and front-end applications; <br />* Work with well-known public APIs like Facebook and LinkedIn; <br />* Design and improve user experience; <br />* Support production systems; <br />* Manage cloud infrastructure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE TEAM<br /><br />We’re a small team of 15 people at Driftrock but we’re growing. Our product development team is 7 people with 6 developers and 1 CTO, this means that anyone we bring in can have a huge impact on the culture and practices of the team.<br /><br />We believe in continuous improvement and we are constantly refining and improving how we work and communicate. One of the ways we do this is by performing fortnightly retrospectives, which are often run by different team members.<br /><br />Currently we make use of daily standups and weekly prioritisation meetings to ensure we're pulling in the same direction and maintaining our focus of delivering value to our end users early and often.<br /><br />ABOUT YOU<br /><br />* You should be keen to learn and improve technical, product and personal skills; <br />* You want to be involved in crafting products whilst building on the culture and process of the product team; <br />* You are happy working in a small team, collaborating closely with other engineers as well as our product and sales teams; <br />* You can provide new and diverse viewpoints for our technical and product discussions; <br />* You are interested in agile practices such as continuous delivery, TDD, pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives; <br />* You are keen to ensure there is a high standard of quality and security in the software we produce as a team; <br />* You are interested in mentoring and coach other team members; <br />* You have had some exposure to Ruby, Elixir or Javascript (we do not expect you to have experience in all of those languages); <br />* You have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br /><br />The interview process has some flexibility but is primarily made up of the following stages:<br /><br />* An initial phone conversation with an engineer; <br />* A take home technical test/coding challenge; <br />* Followed by an on-site pairing interview, where we'll build on your code challenge solution. We then do an informal problem solving task and we finish up with an informal chat with the rest of the team. <br /><br />We try our hardest to reduce the amount of stress involved in the process, we’re not trying to catch you out with trick questions and if at any point (even on the take home test) you have any questions for us we encourage you to ask them.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />* You will work with passionate and smart people, in an environment where we firmly believe in sharing knowledge; <br />* You will be an integral part of a growing and innovative tech startup; <br />* You can be enrolled to the Company’s pension scheme; <br />* The company atmosphere is social and friendly; <br />* You will be part of fun monthly team events.<br /><br />We will not be considering any recruitment agencies for this role.<br /><br />&quot;By applying for this job you hereby give us permission to store your data on our secure applicant tracking system and to contact you with regards to Driftrock Ltd and our job opportunities. We will store your data for a year before deleting all individually identifiable information.
