Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing with the same message to everyone. The result is an ever-increasing wave of generic spam that makes it hard for consumers to build deeper, data-driven relationships with their favorite brands. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.</p><p>Thanx is fundamentally changing that.

But that represents no more than 3% of our codebase. The power of Thanx is in the data-driven marketing intelligence that powers merchant-to-consumer interactions — we don’t show that stuff off publicly, but here’s what it looks like:</p><ul><li><strong>Team</strong>: early engineers at AWS, Cloudera, Climate, Zenefits, Okta. Experience from successful product companies like Disney, Google, and Facebook. A small but elite team that is ready to grow.</li><li><strong>Growth</strong>: 10x YOY data growth; $200M+ delivered to merchants; 200% team growth; modern, rapidly-evolving platform -— adopted Golang, Elasticsearch, NLP, React, React Native, GraphQL, and added 5+ new microservices, all in the last 12 months.</li><li><strong>Culture</strong>: data-driven decision-making, risk-taking, no hierarchy, collaboration &amp; shared responsibility, testing and continuous improvement. As a remote-friendly team, we have flexible work hours. We take time off as needed. We work and play hard — be warned when it comes to Mario Kart, we are super competitive!</li></ul><p><strong>Opportunity</strong></p><ul><li>You could be our 8th engineer (or 9th-16th too — yeah, we’re really scaling now)</li><li>We build the team as a team — once you join, you have equal say in how we evolve.</li><li>Connect millions of offline merchants with billions of customers worldwide</li><li>It’s still early. Growth opportunities include leading teams, being involved in product ideation, design, architecting systems, helping shape engineering, and company culture. And top-notch equity.</li></ul><p><strong>Technologies We Use</strong></p><ul><li>Ruby on Rails, React, React Native, Swift, Objective-C, Java, Kotlin, Golang, Elasticsearch, MySQL, Postgres, AWS, Heroku, Terraform, Docker</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://grnh.se/3250b8e51' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>",

Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings.

We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p>We recently joined forces with a new team, Elastic Code Search and we are now looking to bring on board an experienced Software Engineer to join our globally distributed team.</p><p><strong><strong>What</strong>&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Elastic Code Search?</strong></strong></p><p>Elastic Code Search is a IDE-like semantic code search solution built on top of the Elastic Stack. It helps development teams to search, navigate and collaborate on large code bases more efficiently. Known previously as insight.io, the product has been used and loved by tens of thousands of developers and received 5 star review on chrome store. YOU will be a founding member of Elastic Code Search team and a shaper of the Elastic Code Search product.</p><p><strong><strong>About The Role</strong></strong></p><p>The Software Engineer for Program Analysis will lead our effort to build standardized and open sourced language service that provides code intelligence for both static and dynamic languages. This is the core component of Elastic Code Search, powering core features such as jump to definition, find references and semantic aware search.

Kraken is trusted by hundreds of thousands of traders, institutions, and authorities across the world, from Toyko’s court-appointed trustee to Germany’s BaFin regulated Fidor Bank. In January 2016, Kraken announced that it was acquiring prominent bitcoin exchanges Coinsetter and Cavirtex to expand into American and Canadian markets. <br><br>Kraken is backed by investors including SBI Investment, Money Partners Group, Hummingbird Ventures, Blockchain Capital, and Digital Currency Group, among others. &nbsp; <br><br>&quot;We wake up every single day determined to change the world by delivering a great exchange.

We value your skills more than how long you’ve worked on an application, or whether or not you have a Computer Science degree. We don’t care how you’ve acquired those skills, or how long it took you—as a Senior Software Engineer, you should be able to demonstrate a high degree of expertise.</p><p><strong>Bonus qualifications<br></strong></p><p>As we’re working with a lot of newer technology, we don’t expect you to be fully-versed with our entire tech stack, but you should have some experience in a few of these technologies, exposure to several, and a willingness to learn new skills as necessary:</p><ul><li>Experience designing, developing, documenting, securing, and/or consuming a GraphQL API using Relay or Apollo</li><li>Experience developing inclusive, accessible applications, including experience with accessibility (a11y), internationalization (i18n), and localization (l10n)</li><li>Using MongoDB at Scale</li><li>Experience developing event-driven applications using software such as Kafka</li><li>Functional programming experience</li><li>Programming in a JVM language such as Clojure, or Scala</li></ul><ul><li>Experience developing commerce or logistics software</li><li>Experience developing and deploying containerized applications using Docker and/or Kubernetes</li><li>Experience developing with Elasticsearch or other search engine technology</li><li>Previous contributions to open source projects</li><li>Experience with Kafka</li><li>Experience using Clojure</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Characteristics</strong></strong></p><p>As a distributed team building open source software, we understand that being a great software engineer is much more than having a deep technical skillset.

Candidates who don’t submit the necessary information will not be considered.<br><br>If we decide to move forward with your application, we’ll schedule a 30-45 minute screening video call via Zoom to learn more about your interests, talk about the role, and determine if Reaction Commerce is a mutual fit</p><p>We’ll then have a series of technical interviews. The first interview will be a technical conversation where we’ll discuss previous experience and work to uncover how your skill set might fill a need at Reaction Commerce.</p><p>Following the technical interview we’ll have one or more interviews focused on collaboratively solving problems with members of the engineering team. These interviews will involve writing code in a remote pair-programming type of scenario.</p><p>Finally, if appropriate based on location, we’ll conduct an onsite interview so that you’ll have the opportunity to meet key stakeholders on the team. If we can’t do this in person, we’ll arrange it as a video call.</p><p>At the offer stage, you will learn more about compensation, equity range, and benefits. While the entire process can take 4-6 weeks total depending on schedule availability, we’re committed to communicating progress frequently so you won’t be left wondering about the status of your application. We look forward to meeting you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/197466?reset=False&amp;ra=14dSWOlaMuDm&amp;oqs=a%3D14dSWOlaMuDm' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>            <h3>About Reaction Commerce</h3>            <div><p>At Reaction Commerce, we believe that the best results comes from shared ideas.

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of the development team building our content management system(CMS) that powers our mobile and web applications. &nbsp;You will get to come to work everyday knowing you are helping educate millions of people all around the world.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned JavaScript developer and have a solid knowledge of modern JS frameworks.</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Vue.js, Postgres, Heroku and Rails.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and PTO.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p><p>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a web app, node package or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p><p><strong>Life at HLT</strong></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Remote working</li><li>Flexible hours</li><li>Large amounts of autonomy</li><li>Great pay, insurance, benefits</li></ul><p><strong>So Why HLT?</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in</p><ul><li>Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks</li><li>Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education</li><li>A fast paced and fun work environment</li><li>A career with a higher purpose</li></ul><p>Then we we would love to talk to you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/196220?reset=False&amp;ra=13NYEKqt7OyA&amp;oqs=a%3D13NYEKqt7OyA' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large amounts of autonomy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great pay, insurance, benfits</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

You ensure optimal user convenience of our website for our customers. You create a blazing fast and solid code that is well-structured and documented.</p><p><strong>Goals of our Firebase Developer</strong></p><p>Within your first weeks, you understand our repositories and the concept of our code base. You know the structure and grasp the what's, where's and why's of our code. You know the code and understand the underlying parts and foundations. You know our focus points. You will <strong>build your first tested and user-ready part of our webshop or cloud function</strong> from scratch by using internal and external API's. You receive approval from the users or collegues and feel hungry for more.</p><p>Within the first months you will be able to elaborate a complete subproject, consisting of new and existing cloud functionalities, <strong>from idea to operational product</strong>. Throughout the process, you communicate efficiently with all stakeholders to ensure that the result meets the demands and goals of the project. You make suggestions to improve working conditions and tools so that everybody can work in a more efficient and enjoyable way.</p><p>On the longer term, you will learn to <strong>manage the entire code base</strong>. You give shape to the building tools&nbsp;and manage large parts of the frontend - and possible also backend - webapps. You can easily respond to the needs and demands of the team.</p><p><strong>Skills and competencies</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Goal-driven</strong> - You are result-driven, focused, realistic and resourceful.</li><li><strong>Responsible</strong> - Most of the time you will work on your own. You have enough self-discipline to always go the extra mile for Pit&amp;Pit. You don't need anybody who directs or motivates you.</li><li><strong>Persistent</strong> - You are motivated and have a heart for Pit&amp;Pit. You are a go-getter. The possibilities in IT are endless: if you can explain it, you can program it. You love challenges.</li><li><strong>Energetic</strong> - You work hard, fast-paced, are vital and always want to go forward.</li><li><strong>Good judgement</strong> - You have your own opinion based on common sense and relevant criteria. You communicate your judgment in a clear manner and are willing to re-evaluate it if necessary.</li><li><strong>Vision</strong> - You are able to think ahead, you are aware of current market trends and new developments.</li><li><strong>Pragmatic</strong> - You do not like to work according to rigorous standard rules because 'that's the way everybody does it'. However, you work very orderly and structured. You dare to think out of the box: &quot;everybody said it wasn't possible, until someone came who did not know that&quot; (which was you).</li><li><strong>Innovative</strong> - Every day new, interesting projects and new opportunities pop up. An interest in new techniques is required in order to maintain the code of Pit&amp;Pit efficient and up to date. New insights and chances energize the whole team. For this reason you have to be very efficient at putting the most suitable innovations in development into practice so that efficiency and stability are continuously improved.</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experienced javascript developer, with demonstrable knowledge of svelte (or next.js)</li><li>Experience with the consumption&nbsp;of microservices / API's</li><li>Proactive</li><li>Independent, responsible and accountable</li><li>Energetic</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/167433?reset=False&amp;ra=U9pEBGPPbC8&amp;oqs=a%3DU9pEBGPPbC8' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Pit&amp;Pit</h3>            <div><p>We believe that everybody should be able to enjoy a healthy life.

They are self-motivated, proactive, and have a strong team spirit. If you're tired of the traditional freelancing platforms, you'll be happy to hear that we’re so much more. X-Team is a community of like-minded individuals, carefully chosen to ensure that they can become part of the community of the most motivated people in the world who come together to unleash their potential. What we've created is truly special and not merely a faceless platform. X-Team is where developers go to feel truly at home together while becoming more motivated than they've ever been.<br><strong><br>How long does your vetting/interview process take?</strong></p><p>It varies depending on our immediate needs and how quickly you respond to our questions and requests. On average, it takes 1-3 weeks.</p><p>More importantly though, after a decade of interviewing developers, we've learned how important it is to respect people's time. We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p><p><strong>Will I get a job immediately after applying?</strong></p><p>If your skills, experience, and values align with a current opening we have, your chances of getting hired immediately are high. If we discover you're qualified, but all opportunities have been taken, we'll continue to work with you to help you get a role in X-Team. The key is having the most relevant, in-demand skills when you apply.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Get the chance to work with big brands</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Live and work in one of our roaming hacker houses around the world</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from anywhere as part of a community of digital nomads</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Join our vibrant community</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We provide up to $2,500 in funding for your growth &amp; wellbeing</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Gym reimbursement</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

X-Team is a community of like-minded individuals, carefully chosen to ensure that they can become part of the community of the most motivated people in the world who come together to unleash their potential. What we've created is truly special and not merely a faceless platform. X-Team is where developers go to feel truly at home together while becoming more motivated than they've ever been.<br><strong><br>How long does your vetting/interview process take?</strong></p><p>It varies depending on our immediate needs and how quickly you respond to our questions and requests. On average, it takes 1-3 weeks.</p><p>More importantly though, after a decade of interviewing developers, we've learned how important it is to respect people's time. We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p><p><strong>Will I get a job immediately after applying?</strong></p><p>If your skills, experience, and values align with a current opening we have, your chances of getting hired immediately are high. If we discover you're qualified, but all opportunities have been taken, we'll continue to work with you to help you get a role in X-Team.

Kraken is trusted by hundreds of thousands of traders, institutions, and authorities across the world, from Toyko’s court-appointed trustee to Germany’s BaFin regulated Fidor Bank.

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p><p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</p><p>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p><ul><li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li><li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li><li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li><li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li><li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li><li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li><li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li></ul><p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p><p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p><p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p><p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Analytics Fire</h3>            <div><p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p><p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

Our client works on a range of complex applications for clients in various sectors and they are all greenfield projects so the workload is varied. Projects can take anything from a few weeks to a few months depending on scale and you may be working with different colleagues each time including the CEO themselves who is technical.</p><p>My client specialises in clean code, clean architecture and secure by design C# systems which are often purchased by financial services companies. As some of the concepts are quite abstract it is essential that you have at least a 2:1 in a relevant BSc or BEng subject but preferably a MSc. You should be passionate about problem solving and focused on delivering quality products rather than just working quickly. You will not be using any later versions of Angular so only Angular js experience will be considered relevant.</p><p>My client has a constant stream of upcoming work so it's highly likely this contract will extend. You will get some one to one coaching from the CEO who is extremely well respected in their field and this will definitely add value to your experience. Apply now for more information and telephone interview.</p><p></p></div></div><div></div></div></div>",

They must live to code and not be happy until they’ve seen a project through from insemination to birth to that first day at kindergarten.</p><p></p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong> The dude (or dudette) for the role should have a minimum of two years in the world of web development, with a portfolio that’s likely to blow our socks off.</p><p>Because we live in the virtual world, it does not matter where you reside, as long as you are available during business hours. Still reading?</p><p><strong>Can you tick these boxes?</strong></p><p>● You are a Wordpress Whiz and have extensive knowledge/experience with front-end work.</p><p>● You’re a dab hand in JavaScript/jQuery (If you can write plugins as well then that’s a bonus, but you must be able to write and implement small-to-medium scripts at least)</p><p>● You’re an old pro in writing raw HTML and CSS (especially HTML5 and CSS3)</p><p>● You are experienced working with PHP tasks</p><p>● You’re used to developing in a LAMP environment</p><p>● You’re on-the-button with current Web standards, optimization techniques and best practices</p><p>● You’re full of knowledge regarding Twitter Bootstrap and Foundation</p><p>● You’re a web developer with two or more years of professional industry experience</p><p><strong>And it goes without saying</strong> You can both talk the talk and walk the walk. You have 20:20 vision when it comes to fine details. You consider missing a deadline one of the seven deadly sins. If you’ve gotten this far, you could be just what we’re looking for. Send us your portfolio and we’ll talk.</p><p></p>  </div>",

    "content": "At PassFort, we share a powerful vision to enable businesses & individuals to establish trust online. We’re connecting the human concept of trust with the transformative technology of the internet.<br /><br />We currently do this by giving businesses the tools they need to automate and digitalise the onboarding, verification and management of their customer relationships – that means customers can be onboarded in real-time, from the comfort of their own home.<br /><br />Nowhere are these tools more necessary than in regulated markets – where compliance with regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC), have for too long been a sinkhole for product, engineering & compliance resource and customer goodwill.<br /><br />And this is just the beginning – our long term aim is to bring together all aspects of your identity into a digital passport that can be used securely and interchangeably online. We’re transforming how trust is established online, in the same way that Salesforce transformed sales, Stripe transformed payments and AWS transformed DevOps.<br /><br />What you’ll be doing<br /><br />We’re looking for talented full stack engineers ready to make an impact.<br /><br />You’ll work with a great modern stack – including ES6 and React on the front-end, and Python and Rust on the back-end. We have a microservice based architecture built on top of Kubernetes and Google’s Cloud Platform. <br />We empower our team to have ownership across the entire product. You’ll think about everything from architecture, security and performance, all the way through to feature UX. You’ll be developing entire features, including technical design, implementation and release.<br /><br />You’ll be comfortable working across the code base, and learning new technologies as the business requires – you might prefer a back or front end focus, but you’ll be open to a working knowledge of both.<br /><br />We’ll trust (and depend!) on you to speak up, voice your opinion, and respectfully challenge. You’ll have the chance to bring new ideas, and become an integral part of the process to continuously improve our product, along with our working practices. We think everyone can teach us something – and offer mentorship to more junior members.<br /><br /><br />What we’re looking for<br /><br />We like to keep it simple<br />* Foremost, we’ll be looking for someone who fits well with our company culture and values – Trust, Empowerment and Growth<br />* You’ll need a deep knowledge of either Python, Rust, or Javascript (we use React), and at least a desire to learn the others.<br />* Specialised experience in any of the following areas would be a plus – DevOps (Kubernetes), Security, UX and design<br /><br />The Perks<br /><br />* Equity! We want you to succeed as we do<br />* Great location – we’re central to three stations, and sandwiched between Brick Lane and Spitalfields market<br />* An annual learning & development budget to spend on professional or personal development, we’re invested in both<br />* Birthday off – relax and put your feet up<br />* Dental cover<br />* Access to Perkbox – discounts to services and products (and honestly it’s fantastic)<br />* Equally Enhanced Maternity/Paternity/Shared Leave pay<br />* Generous holiday entitlement<br />* Pension contributions – investing in your future is important<br />* Pick your own equipment and kit<br />* Biscuits… we’re a bit obsessed. We have a weekly ‘guest’ biscuit to broaden your biscuit horizons.<br /><br />Check out our careers site to get more insight into our team, and company culture and values! <br />https://jobs.passfort.com/jobs/105219-fullstack-developer",

We build several platforms for web and mobile, for several organisations ranging from start-ups to well known brands.</p><h4>About the role</h4><p>You might be wanting to step up from a more junior role, or just fancy a change. You might be working in a larger company and… well, be a little bored? Here you won’t be bored; it’s a fast paced and varied environment, where you’ll be trying new technologies and applying them to solve the interesting challenges our clients present.</p><p>You’ll know your craft inside out, but we’ll support your never ending quest to autonomously learn new skills. We like trying new things out in our studio projects. We’re a small company so you’ll have a real say in how we operate. It’s time for you to step up!</p><p>Oh… and we ALL make the tea…</p><h4>Technically ticking the boxes</h4><p><b>You’ll need to be nailing these:</b></p><ul><li>Javascript including ES6 &amp; Node. We use React.js &amp; React Native, and you’ll need to hit the ground running with this. But if your experience is in Angular or VUE.js then that’s good with us – it’s equally valid!</li><li>HTML5 and CSS</li><li>Pre-compilers like SASS, LESS, and bundlers like Grunt, Gulp &amp; Webpack</li><li>GIT</li></ul><p><b>These will massively help your application</b>:</p><ul><li>Working knowledge of other server side &amp; database technologies, such as JAVA (Spring MVC / Spring Boot). We’ve traditionally been a PHP/JAVA/MySQL house – but you can have experience in others.</li><li>Experience in using API based backend services such as Google Firebase, or NoSQL architecture like MongoDB.</li><li>Photoshop/Illustrator/Sketch – we don’t expect you to be an experienced UI designer but you’ll need to appreciate the importance of good design and UI.</li><li>CMS Builds. As a company we offer so much more but we do still do our fair share of WordPress/Contentful builds &amp; similar. A ‘need to know’ around a CMS of your choice is useful.</li></ul><h4>Benefits</h4><p>We understand that different people like different things so we don’t have an official ‘rewards package’… if you want something… ask!</p><p>That said, we offer:<br></p><ul><li>25 days holiday (plus the normal 8 days bank holiday)</li><li>Flexible working hours (we’re a task based organisation)</li></ul><ul></ul><p><b>So - if you think you can step up to the plate and become Spork's new prong, then get in touch! Send through your CVs, portfolios, repository details or whatever you have to jobs@wearespork.net.</b></p>",

Of course there’s plenty of flexibility and lots of opportunities to grow, but we also have share options, private health insurance, and unlimited leave (with a minimum of 5.6 weeks per year - just so everyone actually takes time off). Our CEO is (really) devoted to making Rotageek the best place to work, and so while we work really, really hard, we definitely play hard, too. And we have nice snacks, good beer, amazing team events and a roof terrace.</p><p><b>Your role</b></p><p>We're looking&nbsp;for an experienced JavaScript developer who is proficient with React.js. You’ll be responsible for developing new user-facing features and implementing them following well-known React.js workflows (such as Redux). You will ensure that these components and the overall application are robust, reusable and easy to maintain coordinating with the rest of the team working on different layers of the infrastructure. A commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design, and product quality is important.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rotageek</b></p><p>A few years ago, Rotageek was a small side project; our CEO, an A&amp;E doctor, wanted to improve scheduling in his hospital department. Today, we’re a software company leading the way in reinventing how employees are scheduled. </p><p>We’re helping some of the largest UK organisations move from paper and excel based rotas to intelligent and interactive schedules. In doing so, we’re helping employees gain more ownership over their hours - improving their work-life balance - whilst making sure that businesses improve how they run their operations. We use intelligent technology to make sure the right staff are in the right place at the right time, whilst making the process of creating, communicating and modifying a rota as easy as possible.</p> <p><b>What we expect from our developers</b><br></p><ul><li>You have outstanding software development skills. You write clean, maintainable and technically sound code.</li><li>As part of the development team, you’re responsible for the scalability, security and performance of the platform. This responsibility underlines all of your work and it plays on repeat in your head whilst you code away.</li><li>You really want to build something new. You’re confident in suggesting new and brave ideas, technologies and ways of working.</li><li>You’re super eager, want to learn new technologies and get knee-deep in all areas of the code: front-end, back-end, mobile apps.</li><li>You’re happy to communicate clearly with both techy people as well as the wider business. Meaning you can explain things and not sound like you’re talking about quantum gravity.</li><li>You’re cool with documenting complex processes where needed. We try really hard to keep this to a minimum, but when it must be done it must be done and that’s that.</li></ul><p><b>As the ideal candidate, you have...</b></p><ul><li>A strong proficiency in JavaScript, including DOM manipulation and the JavaScript object model</li><li>A thorough understanding of React.js and its core principles</li><li>Experience with popular React.js workflows (such as Redux)</li><li>Experience with TypeScript</li><li>Familiarity with RESTful APIs</li><li>Familiarity with modern front-end build pipelines and tools</li><li>Experience with tools like Babel, Webpack, NPM, etc.</li><li>Ability to understand business requirements and translate them into technical requirements</li><li>Familiarity with code versioning tools in Git (Bitbucket)</li><li>Experience with mobile app development using React Native (advantageous but not essential)</li></ul><p><b>Apply!</b><br></p><p>If you think this sounds like something you'd enjoy and excel at, we would love to hear from you!&nbsp;</p><p>To apply, please send us your CV and a short paragraph explaining why you think you’d make a great React Developer.</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p> <p>(We’re not looking to work with recruiters for this job posting so please only contact us if you’re a candidate wishing to apply - thank you!)</p>",

Nearly 90% of those transactions happen in a real-world store. Data is king and online it powers personalized customer experiences and product recommendations. Offline, however, it’s still 1999. Brands are blind to their customers, causing them to spend more and more money on “megaphone” marketing with the same message to everyone. The result is an ever-increasing wave of generic spam that makes it hard for consumers to build deeper, data-driven relationships with their favorite brands. No wonder brick-and-mortar stores are being left behind.</p><p>Thanx is fundamentally changing that. As the CRM for offline merchants, Thanx personalizes every interaction between a merchant and their best customers, resulting in measurable increases in revenue for merchants and far greater personalization for consumers. How?</p><ul><li>Through proprietary partnerships with credit card networks (e.g. Visa), Thanx can reward consumers for their purchases and deliver highly-customized promotions to get them to return</li><li>Through our interactive dashboard, Thanx makes even the smallest marketing team a data-science driven expert in personalization, delivering the right message to the right customer at the right time through the right channel.</li><li>And by measuring our success based on revenue generated (not opens and clicks of emails) Thanx is committed to proving that we are actually making an impact for the brands we work with.</li></ul><p>Think of us as Salesforce meets Google Adwords for offline retail.

Now we’re building an ambitious language distribution platform and set of tools so that coders can focus on coding and spend less time worrying about dependency hell, third party vulnerabilities, and inconsistent developer environments.  We’re doing this for every language and platform on the planet (and beyond). We need your help to do it! Best of all you’ll be working on a product that you’ll use yourself daily.</p><p>This position is located in our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC.  However, this position is also open to full-time telecommuters anywhere in North America. </p><p>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING</p><p>Your job is to help us build the tools that take the pain out of developing code in teams. Our lofty goal is to replace the venerable README file with a single command. You’ll work on SaaS applications and command line clients and more. While a primary amount of your job will be described as back-end work you must be comfortable messing around with the front-end as well.</p><p>When not working on code, you’ll be meeting with your team to figure out priorities, features, technical issues, etc. You’re someone with good technical knowledge who also has an interest in the end-product you’ll be building.</p><p>Our day to day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development with Pivotal Tracker as our project management tool. We’re always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so.</p><p>We’re a polyglot company and embrace using the best language for the given task at hand. You’ll regularly find Golang, Elm, Javascript, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, DCOS, CircleCI, and other modern tools. Quality is as important as speed. We’re building for the long run, so you’ll need to be proficient in writing tests and documentation too.</p><p>Our back ends and command line tools for interacting with our Platform are written in Go. Experience with Go is mandatory. The front end is written in Elm. Knowledge of Elm, while prefered, is not a prerequisite. We’ve found engineers with experience in React/Redux take to the language quite naturally.</p><p>The team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Highfive for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and the Google Suite.</p><p>We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code.</p><p>WORKING AT ACTIVESTATE</p><p>ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We’re all about working together to find the best solutions, and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all of us.</p><p>Our company is a team of 35+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles including software development and QA. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we’re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events.</p><p>Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly don’t lack for ambition! But even though we’re ambitious we don’t expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches.</p><p>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU</p><p>Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up.The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people.The chance to work on a project that will change the work lives of developers around the world.Competitive salary, bonus, and stock option plan.Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program.</p><p>REQUIREMENTS</p><p>Plenty of experience with Go.Experience with relational database (mysql, postgres, ..).Adequate knowledge of JavaScript and front end development.Good working knowledge of Docker.Experience building both web based and desktop based software.Experience with all 3 major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).The ability to write clean, well-tested code with clear documentation.Decent knowledge of cloud infrastructure.Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical. You’ll need to work closely with your developer teammates, as well as be able to have coherent conversations with people from QA, sales, marketing, and other parts of the company.A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company.The ability to help others on the team become better at their jobs through mentoring, thoughtful code reviews, and generally being a team player.</p><p>ASSETS</p><p>If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter:</p><p>Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI.Javascript tooling such as Webpack and frameworks such as React and Redux.Elm code, especially large Single Page Apps.Microservices and message queues.Docker, Mesos, DCOS, Kubernetes.Functional programming languages.Experience Creating parsers, compilers or code intelligence systemsDeep understanding Process management on Window or Unix environmentsWork with reactive, event based systemsLow level architecture (sockets, primitive data types like in C) and the ability to interface and interact with low level libraries (e.g. debuggers).</p><p>We are committed to creating a welcoming environment for everyone at ActiveState and we welcome applicants from all walks of life.</p><p>Even if you don’t feel you meet every exact requirement, we still would love to hear from you and why you think you would be an awesome addition to our team and we encourage you to apply.</p>        </div>        <h4>To Apply</h4>        <p>Please submit your contact info, resume, and a cover letter to <span><span>apply-9105</span> [at] <span>functionaljobs [dot] com</span></span>.

You’ll be an integral part of our engineering team focused on building and scaling a world-class product.</p><p>We do things a little differently here at Knack, and that’s just how we like it:</p><p>* Flat: we don’t have project managers or dictates from a CTO. Each engineer is lead on multiple projects and is expected to make major decisions.<br>* Autonomous: our engineers own their projects, collectively determine technical implementation, and have the freedom to define how they can maximize their impact.<br>* Engaged: our engineers think of their job as more than just 1s and 0s. Only by engaging with our product, our customers, and our team can they be fully equipped to do their best work.<br>* Remote: to make this work our engineers are great communicators and are highly involved with hangouts/chat/discussions around both engineering topics and larger company issues.</p><p>This isn’t for everyone, but for the right fit this will be the definitive experience of your career. Our goal will be to ensure you are driven and supported to continuously grow and do your best work.</p><p>This is a senior position, so we’re looking for a strong track record of shipping code and building products at scale. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>About the Job</p><p>Our senior engineers are ultimately responsible for delivering an outstanding product. This includes:<br>* Implementing and architecting new features.<br>* Optimizing our systems for performance, including speed, reliability, redundancy, and geographic distribution.<br>* Fixing bugs and issues.<br>* Working with our success team to address customer issues and concerns.<br>* Building tools and processes to improve our operations and help us detect and respond to issues.</p><p>How you’ll do this:</p><p>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our current engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*Our stack*</p><p>AWS - we’ve drunk the kool-aid and use AWS across the board.<br>Node.js - APIs<br>MongoDB, Redis, MariaDB - data persistence<br>Vue.js, Backbone - our front-end is largely raw JavaScript/jQuery/Backbone, currently migrating to Vue.js.<br>Github, Jenkins, Webpack - deployment<br>Ghost Inspector, Sentry, LogRocket - testing</p><p>*About You*</p><p>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.</p><p>*About Knack*</p><p>Knack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data.</p><p>Knack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we’ve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*</p><p>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. </p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p></div>",

You’ll be an integral part of our product and engineering teams focused on architecting and developing our client-side programming.</p><p>We’re looking for a strong track record of architecting and building products. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>*What You'll Do*<br>* Lead development on the client layer and user experience.<br>* Develop a comprehensive HTML/CSS/JS framework for rendering web applications for multiple devices and themes.<br>* Refine the application building experience that makes it a delight for our customers to use and extend Knack.<br>* Consistently improve the speed, reliability, and performance of the Knack client application.<br>* Evaluate new technologies and help determine opportunities to leverage these.<br>* Work on implementing front-end Knack features.</p><p>How you’ll do this:<br>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our small engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*About You*<br>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You’re an outstanding communicator. You can document a problem, and clearly and succinctly outline a solution. You’re not afraid to distill things into plain English for teammates and customers.</p><p>You have experience working in fast-paced environments, prioritizing and balancing multiple projects, and working with cross-functional teams.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.</p><p>*About Knack*<br>Knack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data.</p><p>Knack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we’ve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>So why are we different?</p><p>We’re bootstrapped: we’ve had to build something our customers actually pay for. This changes how you do things.</p><p>We’re 100% remote: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.</p><p>We’re small: and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars-- we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.</p><p>We enjoy the journey: we’re in this for the long haul. We’re not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We’re building something we’re proud of and want to keep improving on.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*<br>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It’s not about separation, it’s about optimization.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You’ll get forced days off for birthdays and knackiversaries.</p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p><p>Please note that we are only considering applicants legally eligible to work in the US.</p></div>",

We're looking for people who are ambitious and deeply driven to make a difference. <br /><br />Your ability as a general pragmatic developer and fast learner is what truly matters to us. As you read the specifics below, keep in mind that the skill we are looking for is more in the lines of &quot;awesome solver of challenges&quot; than any one specific skill. <br /><br />You would work on JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS and other techs to create a great looking modern and responsive web driven UI. You would also be ready to dive into the Django and Python underpinnings and add the bits necessary for a great user experience. Underneath it all you'll find Postgres, Redis and a good heaping of Docker.<br /><br />While this ad is about the front-end, we're really into jacks-of-all trades. We think in a startup every team member needs to be nimble and flexible enough to do whatever it takes to deliver the product.<br /><br />You can expect to work with a small full time team of crafty developers, in a quickly growing startup. We're a remote only shop so you'll never feel you're not in the loop due to not being in the main office -- there is no main office!<br /><br />You like:<br /><br />* Detail oriented front-end work.<br />* Great UX.<br />* Occasionally fun UI and UX.<br />* Unit tests, integration tests, ui tests, test tests, every test.<br />* Python.<br /><br />This is a full-time position. We only hire individuals, not agencies. Please state the square root of twenty five in your cover letter. You will need to attend a daily meeting and a fortnightly video planning meeting (around 16:00 UTC) so please don’t apply if that doesn’t work for you or you can’t work a semi-regular 5-day week. Hours are very flexible, but you do have to be around often enough for the rest of the team to interact with you.<br /><br />To be considered for the role, please provide the answer to the following two questions:<br /><br />* On http://gist.github.com, post a short snippet of code (less than 1 screen) that you're proud of and tell us what's great about it.<br />* What do you think about the new Python syntax which was just announced?",

We avoid the noise of Slack, but we use Twist, Keybase and Confluence to keep in sync. We use Gitlab to take advantage of their integrated CI pipeline and issue tracker (we love to automate stuff!).</p><h2>Who you are</h2><p>You’re an experienced front-end web developer who has worked for 3+ years on a few production web and hybrid-mobile apps. Experience building financial or accounting applications preferred.</p><p>You've built apps using Vue.js, or you have a couple personal projects you can show. You appreciate its simplicity versus other frameworks, but you can also talk about the differences.</p><p>You've used Vuex to manage state in your apps, and remember when <code>axios</code> replaced <code>vue-resource</code> for making HTTP calls. You like to keep app logic and state separate from visual components, where possible.</p><p>You write unit tests for your Vuex modules, and you've played around with end-to-end testing for UI components. You've tried either Flowtype or Typescript for static typing, and have a strong opinion (loosely held) for one or the other. Your IDE helps you lint as you type, but you still like to run code through a linter before a <code>git commit</code>.</p><p>You're aware of the best UI practices for both web and mobile apps. You like hamburgers (veggie or meaty), but not in your navigation menus, if you can help it. You've skimmed through the Material Design guidelines, and have glanced at Apple's HIGs. You know how to build a good form on both large and small screens, and you care about reducing cognitive load for users.</p><p>You appreciate that <code>dribbble</code> is a great place to find visual inspiration and fresh ideas. However, you understand that realistic designs which solve real business problems are better than form-over-function portfolio pieces. You know your way around Sketch, Framer, Figma, Adobe XD or other vector-based prototyping tools. You know the basics of microinteractions and how to use animations to improve the user experience, not hinder it. You know when to implement transitions in CSS, how to use Vue's <code>&lt;transition&gt;</code> and friends, and when something like Velocity or mo.js would do the trick.</p><p>You've used Cordova to bundle a simple web app into native packages for iOS and Android. You've been curious about attempts to bridge Javascript and native code, such as React Native or Nativescript.</p><p>Most importantly, you can communicate clearly and efficiently in writing, as well as in online video/audio calls. You can handle the async (over)communication requirements of a remote-first environment and can manage your own time and productivity.</p><p>For everyone’s sake, you develop on either OS X or a Linux flavor. We don’t do windows.</p><h2>What you’ll do</h2><p>We have already launched our web, iOS and Android apps and are beginning to gain traction. We've seen 1,500% user growth in August alone!</p><p>We accomplished this by having a single code base for all three apps, which allowed us to launch and scale fast. The time has come to jump to the next level of user experience, and optimize our apps for web and mobile separately.</p><p>You will work with the CTO to redesign the web and mobile app layouts, navigation and user flows, while adhering to the existing brand styleguide. Once a good design prototype has been created, you will use the latest version of Quasar Framework to build two versions of the app (web and mobile), while sharing as much of the existing code as possible.</p><p>You will also help develop functional prototypes using Nativescript and the recently released Vue.js integration, to explore whether we should upgrade the mobile apps from hybrid to something closer to native.</p><p>You will contribute to other design-related tasks, such as improving transactional email templates, or assisting with landing page redesigns across our web properties.</p><p>Once you have a grasp on how things currently work, you will take on more responsibilities, such as creating the design direction for future UI updates, but only if that's the type of challenge you're willing to tackle. We know that repetitive work leads to boredom and burnout, so you'll never lack opportunities to step out of your comfort zone!</p><p>Other than Vue.js, you are not required to have significant experience with our existing stack, but you need to have the ability and desire to learn.</p><p>You must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident who can legally work in the United States.</p><h2>What you’ll get</h2><ul><li>you can work remote from anywhere in the world (note the citizenship / residence requirement above!) or from our office in Boca Raton, FL</li><li>you’ll set your own work schedule, as long as you can deliver and be productive (we prefer two 3-hour focused, uninterrupted work sessions, with morning, lunch and evening communication breaks to stay in sync)</li><li>competitive salary for a remote position</li><li>your choice of Apple Macbook or Dell XPS Developer Edition, plus a budget for accessories (keyboard, touchpad, headset, whatever makes you more productive)</li><li>monthly gym membership, provided you actively use it. Otherwise, running shoes stipend or similar. Stay healthy!</li><li>health insurance &amp; stock options</li></ul>                </div><a href='https://worthy-financial.breezy.hr/p/3974d838d5e401-front-end-developer' rel='nofollow'>Apply now!</a>",

Now we’re building an ambitious language distribution platform and set of tools so that coders can focus on coding and spend less time worrying about dependency hell, third party vulnerabilities, and inconsistent developer environments.  We’re doing this for every language and platform on the planet (and beyond). We need your help to do it! Best of all you’ll be working on a product that you’ll use yourself daily.</p><p>This position is located in our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC.  However, this position is also open to full-time telecommuters anywhere in North America. </p><p>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING</p><p>Your job is to help us build the tools that take the pain out of developing code in teams. Our lofty goal is to replace the venerable README file with a single command. You’ll work on SaaS applications and command line clients and more. While a primary amount of your job will be described as back-end work you must be comfortable messing around with the front-end as well.</p><p>When not working on code, you’ll be meeting with your team to figure out priorities, features, technical issues, etc. You’re someone with good technical knowledge who also has an interest in the end-product you’ll be building.</p><p>Our day to day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development with Pivotal Tracker as our project management tool. We’re always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so.</p><p>We’re a polyglot company and embrace using the best language for the given task at hand. You’ll regularly find Golang, Elm, Javascript, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, DCOS, CircleCI, and other modern tools. Quality is as important as speed. We’re building for the long run, so you’ll need to be proficient in writing tests and documentation too.</p><p>Our back ends and command line tools for interacting with our Platform are written in Go. Experience with Go is mandatory. The front end is written in Elm. Knowledge of Elm, while prefered, is not a prerequisite. We’ve found engineers with experience in React/Redux take to the language quite naturally.</p><p>The team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Highfive for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and the Google Suite.</p><p>We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code.</p><p>WORKING AT ACTIVESTATE</p><p>ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We’re all about working together to find the best solutions, and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all of us.</p><p>Our company is a team of 35+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles including software development and QA. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we’re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events.</p><p>Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly don’t lack for ambition! But even though we’re ambitious we don’t expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches.</p><p>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU</p><p>Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up.The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people.The chance to work on a project that will change the work lives of developers around the world.Competitive salary, bonus, and stock option plan.Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program.</p><p>REQUIREMENTS</p><p>Plenty of experience with Go.Experience with relational database (mysql, postgres, ..).Adequate knowledge of JavaScript and front end development.Good working knowledge of Docker.Experience building both web based and desktop based software.Experience with all 3 major platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows).The ability to write clean, well-tested code with clear documentation.Decent knowledge of cloud infrastructure.Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical. You’ll need to work closely with your developer teammates, as well as be able to have coherent conversations with people from QA, sales, marketing, and other parts of the company.A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company.The ability to help others on the team become better at their jobs through mentoring, thoughtful code reviews, and generally being a team player.</p><p>ASSETS</p><p>If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter:</p><p>Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI.Javascript tooling such as Webpack and frameworks such as React and Redux.Elm code, especially large Single Page Apps.Microservices and message queues.Docker, Mesos, DCOS, Kubernetes.Functional programming languages.Experience Creating parsers, compilers or code intelligence systemsDeep understanding Process management on Window or Unix environmentsWork with reactive, event based systemsLow level architecture (sockets, primitive data types like in C) and the ability to interface and interact with low level libraries (e.g. debuggers).</p><p>We are committed to creating a welcoming environment for everyone at ActiveState and we welcome applicants from all walks of life.</p><p>Even if you don’t feel you meet every exact requirement, we still would love to hear from you and why you think you would be an awesome addition to our team and we encourage you to apply.</p>        </div>        <h4>To Apply</h4>        <p>Please submit your contact info, resume, and a cover letter to <span><span>apply-9105</span> [at] <span>functionaljobs [dot] com</span></span>.

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p><p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p><p></p><ul><li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li><li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li><li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li><li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li><li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li><li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li><li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li></ul><p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p><p></p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment.

Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

We specialize in a holistic approach inspired by HCD and Lean. Services include CTO consulting, product strategy, engagement strategy, UX/UI, and development plus long term BML iterations and maintenance. We work with large and small companies/startups on projects ranging from 1-6 months with 2-6 people on each project.</p><p>We build full stack web, mobile, physical installations, etc. Our favorite stack is React/Redux, GraphQL, Rails, and React Native. We also use a wide range of other tech as needed since we face a pretty diverse set of challenges. Recent and upcoming examples: Elixir/Phoenix, .Net, C++/Qt, embedded Linux, Native iOS/Swift, Native Android/Kotlin.</p><p>Working at Blackbird is very different from larger product companies. We operate in very strategic relationships with our clients which gives us a unique opportunity every few months to deep dive into a new interesting understanding of our client's business and build ground up new apps where everyone is making major and early contributions.</p><p>We are looking for a Lead Developer with extensive experience in dev team leadership, new product development, and collaboration with business and design stakeholders. Serious consulting experience is also a huge plus. Specific skills ideally include our favorite stack (at least very interested in learning) plus (ideally) knowledge of either native iOS or Android. As a senior Blackbird team member, occasional travel to San Francisco and other locations is part of the job for project kickoffs and other critical collaboration phases or meetings. In a given month this can be anywhere from no travel up to a couple days every week or occasionally an entire week on site with a client.</p><p>I am a founder so ask me anything!

We work closely with Shopify expanding the native functionality with bespoke Rails apps that leverage Shopify’s extensive API, as well as building fully-custom front-end experiences. We are a core Partner of Shopify, with advance access to upcoming APIs and features, and are always looking to push the boundaries of what companies understand Shopify being able to achieve.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Our team is small with steady growth and fully distributed, and working remotely has been part of our DNA since Day 1. This means you will find a great remote working environment focused around making your day-to-day enjoyable and efficient, both through excellent tooling (Slack, Rubymine), and a remote-only culture.</div><div>As part of a remote team, we encourage finding a setup that provides both the work productivity and lifestyle that suits everyone, even if that is something completely different for each person. Without geographic constraints, time and location can be flexible to fit around each team member’s needs.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As our clients are also remote, we occasionally travel to spend time embedded in their offices, and this can also provide time as a team to come together. Outside of these trips, we also organise an annual meetup to bring everyone together for a few days to get away from our desks, bridge the remote-working gap, and plan for the future direction of the company - this year the team came together for a week in Hong Kong, whilst previous years have included California and Miami.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The company has evolved around a few core principles: quality over quantity, under-promise and over-deliver, and taking pride in your work. We take on projects that will present new problems for us to solve, and get excited about elegant solutions to complex challenges. Most importantly, we want to invest in our team - we encourage continuous learning and development and aim for a high degree of code-review as part of the day-to-day experience.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About you</b><br></div><div></div><div>We are seeking a junior front-end developer with a keen eye for UI and UX design to help us grow our team. You will be exposed to a variety of different web apps and e-commerce front-end builds (predominantly on the Shopify platform), and given ownership of some upcoming projects currently in the planning stage.</div><div><br></div><div>An ideal candidate will be highly self-motivated, able to take initiative in solving problems, and someone that can take ownership of projects, without needing to be micromanaged.</div><div>You will need to be comfortable translating wireframes into a highly intuitive interface, whilst being able to suggest and implement UX improvements in an agile way as you build and receive feedback from the team and stakeholders. Working as part of a remote team has many great advantages, however you will be expected to be able to communicate clearly with the team over a variety of different mediums (including daily video calls, demoing wireframes via Invision, etc), take a task through to completion, and be comfortable with raising issues or questions along the way.</div><div><br></div><div>As a remote team across time zones, we have a flexible approach to work schedule, however we would usually expect you to cross at least 5 hours of 8am - 6pm Monday to Friday GMT+0 during your first year of working with us.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We favour a CS background over any specific language or technology skills, but as part of this we would expect a foundational understanding in HTML, Javascript, Scss / Sass, the modern web and Git.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Required knowledge and experience</b></div><ul><li>Familiarity with Javascript, writing semantic markup and using a preprocessor such as Sass, as well as proficiency with Git<br></li><li>Some experience working with Grunt / Gulp workflows<br></li><li>Strong verbal and written communication in English<br></li><li>Exceedingly detail-oriented – for you, a UI build is not complete until it looks pixel perfect<br></li><li>Deliver readable, well-documented and efficient code<br></li><li>Naturally organized and self-directed</li></ul><div><br></div><div><b>Desirable knowledge and experience</b></div><ul><li>Experience with the Shopify platform<br></li><li>Experience with writing in ES6 syntax and using Webpack<br></li><li>Contributions to open-source projects<br></li><li>Some experience with Ruby on Rails and / or React<br></li></ul><div></div><div><br></div><div><b>Salaries and Perks</b></div><ul><li>You can work from anywhere that enables you to have 5 working hours fall within a UK working day (8am-6pm)<br></li><li>Starting salary £25k - £32k<br></li><li>Flexible workspace allowance<br></li><li>Professional Development allowance<br></li><li>Team retreats in a different global location each year - suggestions open for 2019!<br></li><li>A brand new laptop — developers usually use Macbook Pros, or Dell XPS 13s (feel free to ask for what allows you to do your job best)<br></li><li>30 days holiday</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Pixelcabin is committed to building a culturally diverse company, and we value a broad set of opinions in our team. As we grow, we are looking to build a team with a range of viewpoints at its core, and we encourage applications from female and minority candidates.<br></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><ul></ul><ul></ul><div></div>            </div><div>How to apply:<br>Please send all applications to <a href='mailto:jobs@pixelcabin.io' rel='nofollow'>jobs@pixelcabin.io</a>, including your Github, LinkedIn, and any other relevant links.

    "content": "<p>Hello, this is Ben Lattimore from Lattimore and Friends and we are looking for our first junior web developer to join us!<br></p><p><b>So, who are you?</b></p><p>You’ll be friendly, with a keen eye for design and some initial coding ability. We definitely aren’t looking for computer science graduates - we’re looking for a genuine junior who brings a base level of knowledge and the enthusiasm to learn.</p><p>Indeed, you don’t even need to have a degree at all. Perhaps you smashed through all the courses on Codecademy or Treehouse, perhaps you did one of those 8/10/12/15 week crash courses, perhaps you did it the old school way with books from the library. However you got here, we want to take you further. It should also be said here that we’d be so stoked to give more women and/or those from other backgrounds their first step into tech.</p><p><b>So, who are we?</b></p><p>We work with some of London’s most exciting creative, branding and communications agencies, providing them with the best possible WordPress experience (amongst other languages).</p><p>We have a unique way of working that allows us to delivery great value and at the same time, maintain amazing quality.</p><p>We’re growing rapidly and need our first full-time developer to help us out.</p><p><b>So, what will you do?</b></p><p>There are two parts to this role, which overlap and should keep you engaged and supercharge your learning.</p><p>1.) Manage our distributed developers</p><p>You will be given responsibility on day one to manage our team of great distributed developers. You will need to ensure the end results matches the designs, use your front-end skills to offer thoughts and improvements and ultimately to read and check the code coming back to us. This will be challenging but you’ll be given loads of support and we can assure you that, hard as it is, reading other people’s code is one of the best ways to learn development yourself.</p><p>2.) Code yourself</p><p>We always finish and refine our projects here in London and it is at this point you can spread your coding wings. You’ll be making final changes to the front-end, doing various WordPress fixes and improvements and generally tackling myriad problems via code. You will have gone through our in-house WordPress training course before doing this, don’t worry!</p><p>Once you are ready, you will also go in-house with our clients for 1-3 days at a time to deliver the most critical phase - the in-house refining and finishing, working closely with the original designers. This will be a challenge for you but you will not be expected to jump into this deep-end until you feel confident.</p><p><b>So, what do you need?</b></p><p>We need three things from you:</p><p>1.) Some coding ability</p><ul><ul><ul><li>Bring your HTML, CSS and perhaps some basic jQuery with you</li><li>If you know some SASS (or can learning this before you start), that’s even better</li><li>If you have tinkered with some WordPress theme files in the past, that’s awesome but not at all required</li></ul></ul></ul><p>2.) An eye for design</p><ul><ul><ul><li>The biggest complaint we hear from our clients is that websites, once developed, rarely look like the original design. This is a nuisance at best and a business-threatening problem at worst. We’re proud that our most common feedback is how accurate we are to designs and how we work hard to work with designers - and offer them thoughts on how to get the most from their designs.</li><li>You need to value and understand great design, even if you couldn’t design it yourself - taste is what we are after!</li></ul></ul></ul><p>3.) Be a people person</p><ul><ul><ul><li>Developers have a reputation for being anti-social and a bit unfriendly. We aim to build string relationships, even friendships, with our clients. </li><li>Do people call you charming? Funny, witty? Great to have around? If so, you’ll be a great fit. It’s so much easier to train a chatty, friendly person how to code than to try and make an ornery developer into a pleasure to be around.</li><li>After 6 months or so, you’ll be let loose upon our clients and spending time in their offices. You should be a fun, engaging and friendly presence (who impresses with your hard-work and diligence too) for the day or so you are there. You should be slightly missed when you’re not around.</li></ul></ul></ul><p><b>So, what do you get?</b></p><ul><li>The London Living Wage (£10.20 p/h), working out to £21,500 annual salary</li><li>A MacBook Air</li><li>A great place to work in our WeWork in Shoreditch, with its free coffee, tea, biscuits, beer and free events and activities like yoga.</li></ul><p>As can be expected, personal development is hugely important to us - especially as the founder was a self-taught developer - so you will be given the following:</p><ul><li>A paid subscription to your choice of learning platform e.g. Treehouse, Udemy, etc</li><li>The time and support to work on personal web development projects to help you maximise your learning. This could be a bespoke blog for a friend (or yourself!), to a simple web app to anything and everything in between. Make sure to bring some of these ideas to the interview.</li></ul><p><b>So, what do you need to do now?</b></p><p>A proposed start date is Thursday 1st November (random date, but means we can get you settled in before the start of a full week) but do let us know if another date would work best.</p><p>We’ll be holding interviews on a rolling basis until we find the right person, but we will aim to have a lot on the 8th and 9th October, so try and keep those days free.</p><p>In you application, do send over:</p><ul><li>A brief description of how you got into coding and what you have used to learn thus far</li><li>Send over an example of a website with great design, and explain why</li><li>Any examples of your web work thus far</li><li>CV</li><li>Cover letter</li></ul>",

After a terrible experience trying to buy a mattress, the team set out to make a mattress and experience that people could love.We view Tuft &amp; Needle not as a mattress company that makes software, but as a software company that sells mattresses. We’re a small team of passionate full-stack developers. We frequently seek out advice from each other and believe in continuous learning. We’re incredibly focused on results and don’t expect specific, regular hours in the office (we have a pretty sweet office though). Although sometimes we pair program, we aren’t religious about it. We believe process should be extracted from things that are working well.Our stack consists primarily of ES5/ES2016, React, Redux, Express, Middleman, HAML, Pug, SASS, Ruby, Rails, and Postgres and is deployed to Now and S3. Our codebase has excellent test coverage and we have CircleCI for continuous integration and believe strongly in continuous deployment. Test coverage is currently being rewritten in the form of end to end tests with Cypress.We’re looking for someone to join our engineering team as a front-end developer for <a href='http://tuftandneedle.com/' rel='nofollow'>tuftandneedle.com</a> as well as our internal CRM and administration systems. You’ll collaborate with the rest of the engineering team on developing new features to our public site as well as our internal applications and assisting with marketing efforts to rapidly test and implement changes to the existing public content. Our ideal candidate will be fluent in HTML and CSS and have experience with preprocessors like HAML, SASS, LESS, Pug, or Stylus. Being a well-rounded JavaScript developer is more important than knowing the latest MV* framework or knowing what bleeding-edge tools are being developed.What You'll Do:<ul><li>Join our engineering team as a front-end developer for <a href='http://tuftandneedle.com/' rel='nofollow'>tuftandneedle.com</a> as well as our internal CRM and administration systems</li><li>Collaborate with the engineering team on developing new features to our public site as well as our internal applications</li><li>Assist with marketing efforts to rapidly test and implement changes to the existing public content&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Qualities We're Looking For:</p><ul><li>Fluent in HTML and CSS and have experience with preprocessors like HAML, SASS, LESS, Pug, or Stylus</li><li>Broad knowledge of JavaScript</li><li>Fluent in React and Redux or another mature front-end framework</li><li>A love for learning</li><li>Excellent communication skills</li><li>The ability to see projects through to completion</li></ul><p>Time &amp; Benefits:</p><ul><li>Full time, 40 hours per week</li><li>Free mattress</li><li>Health benefits for employee and dependents</li><li>Paid Maternity/Paternity leave</li><li>401k with company match</li><li>Generous vacation and sick leave policy</li><li>Monthly company events</li><li>Snacks and drinks stocked in the fridge if working from our Phoenix HQ</li><li>Casual dress code, open office environment</li></ul><p>Values of the Engineering Team:</p><ul><li>End-to-end ownership: Each project gets an Engineering owner that is responsible for the success of the project.</li><li>Launch early and iterate: Done is better than perfect. Although we maintain a minimum standard of quality, we believe in getting value out of features and enhancements as soon as possible, while rapidly iterating.</li><li>Do things that don’t scale: We believe that our software should automate existing manual processes to save time, rather than preempt potential needs to avoid building unnecessary software. Our litmus test for deciding on new features is “Has the team done this manually first?”. Of course, we’re pragmatic even about this value.</li><li>Pragmatism: In a growing startup, our philosophy is that it’s important to be pragmatic. We are rarely dogmatic and use Judo moves to efficiently solve problems.</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://careers.tn.com/position/?id=294089ce-3824-4e1c-9f24-2bd4a2df503c' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Tuft &amp; Needle</h3>            <div><p>Tuft &amp; Needle was founded in 2012 by two software engineers who quit their jobs in Silicon Valley and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. In a $14 billion industry full of marketing gimmicks, unfair markups, sales commissions, and overwhelming options, we've used an iterative design and development process to create superior, honest products at a fair price. That philosophy is reflected in everything we do.</p><p>A developer mindset guides every aspect of our business — from the products we create to the day-to-day operations of the company — we ideate, iterate, and constantly improve. We believe process should be extracted from things that are working well, not just what we’ve done in the past. We are hyper-focused on results, and don’t expect our team to hold specific office hours (although we do have a pretty sweet office). We aren’t against formal scrum sprints and stand-ups, but have found that our team works well without them.</p><p>Check out our developer site to meet our digital team at developer.tn.com!</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Medical and Dental monthly premiums paid by T&amp;N</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Paid Maternity and Paternity Leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dollar-for-dollar 401K match (up to 4%)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation Days</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>HSA Contribution</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Wide range of snacks and drinks stocked in the fridge</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Beautiful office with options to work in open or private settings</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Free mattress upon joining the team</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

To help our customers adopt our products quickly and help fuel our company growth to support them, we’re looking for an experienced web developer to work on the digital marketing team to shape HashiCorp’s 9+ web properties into examples of premier web development and user experience. The ideal candidate will be a seasoned full-stack web developer who cares deeply about excellent design, architecture, and performance, and is extremely comfortable with javascript at an advanced level.<strong>&nbsp;This is a full-time remote position&nbsp;</strong>and will report to the engineering lead of digital marketing.</p><p><strong>What we’re looking for:</strong></p><ul><li>Thorough experience with node.js and express, familiarity with HTTP and how web servers work</li><li>Fluency with HTML, CSS, and client-side javascript</li><li>Fluency with modern javascript standards – all our code is es6 and we are aggressive about adopting new features and standards</li><li>A good understanding of javascript bundling and performance (we use webpack)</li><li>Significant experience with react and/or preact</li><li>Understanding and experience with both unit and integration testing</li><li>Ability to take on a project and complete it independently with minimal oversight</li><li>Comfort interacting with and presenting for senior staff and managers</li><li>Complete comfort reading others’ code and learning new things. There will be a lot of new things to learn here regardless of your experience</li><li>At least a decent understanding of database design and both relational and nosql data modeling</li><li>The ability to write clear and concise readmes and documentation, and to thoroughly explain your work both to other developers inside and outside marketing as well as non-technical staff</li></ul><p>One of the big draws of this job that you’ll struggle to find elsewhere is that this team is something of a hybrid between a digital agency and a product company. We have a lot of projects going on at any given time, and are frequently booting up new, greenfield projects. At the same time, we have plenty of important pieces of infrastructure to maintain, refactor, improve, and keep running smoothly. On top of that, we have such a wide variety of work available between frontend, backend, testing, visual programming, and data engineering, that your manager will be asking what type of work you enjoy doing and moving you into that area, rather than simply assigning you something and being done with it. Here’s a little background on the types of work our team does:</p><ul><li>HashiCorp has 6 products and runs several global event sites in addition to the primary corporate site. This means we have nine websites to maintain overall. All of them are consistently being tested and updated. Part of your job will be working on these sites to make them the best they can be. We use an innovative meld of dynamic and static methods to serve the websites, as well as a preact-based global component library to keep styling and code standards consistent across them all.</li><li>We also run several backend services to keep these sites up and running, from small apps connected with databases to larger login systems and ETL-type provider integrations with user interaction. If working with node on the backend is more your thing, we have a lot there as well. Because building quality, reliable services is important to us, all our services have integration tests and excellent test coverage.</li><li>We run a lot of tests across the entire range of what is possible to test with several web applications. From unit to integration tests, and from selenuim-like cypress tests to visual diff generation, our team really cares about having great test coverage across all our projects. We have have plenty of error monitoring and dependency checking and updating services running at all times.</li><li>Want to let your creative side free? We also frequently work on interactive graphics and animations to include a little extra sparkle on our pages, and to help demonstrate to users how HashiCorp’s deeply technical solutions actually work. We have animation work and close collaboration with designers available at all times.</li><li>Do you like building client-side apps? We lean heavily on (p)react components both for consistency across our many web properties, as well as to build out interactive forms and small apps where needed. We’re pretty deep into advanced react patterns, so there’s plenty of great react development opportunities.</li><li>If data processing and engineering is a focus, we do lots of work moving data between a large array of different third-party services via api, and working on collecting and organizing data coming in from the many services that people use to interact with HashiCorp, as well as database engineering for this same data to ensure that we are able to utilize it to make informed decisions about how to best serve our users and customers.</li><li>If software architecture gets you excited, we have plenty of that. This department is still very new, and we often get to work on greenfield projects, where one project lead can architect a new app, website, or service (or all three) from the ground up.</li><li>And of course, there is also plenty of opportunity to work on large, complex projects that already exist. Whether it’s adding new features, refactoring, or working on testing, there is plenty of opportunity to take ownership over important pieces of how the company runs.</li><li>Best of all, if you enjoy growing your skills by working on a large variety of different interesting tasks, you can absolutely do that here. We won’t have you working only on a gigantic react app; we’ve got many, many different types of work and you get a say in what is compelling for you.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.hashicorp.com/jobs/1328163' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if:</p><p>You care deeply about improving frontend technology so our customers can have a great experience using our product.</p><p>About You</p><p>You love code.&nbsp;You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).</p><p>You love great UX.&nbsp;You spend most of your time coding, but you also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, you care about more than&nbsp;just&nbsp;the code.</p><p>You love learning new things.&nbsp;You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Python, CSS, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it.</p><p>You can balance lots of concerns.&nbsp;Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.</p><p>You love helping others.&nbsp;You love sharing knowledge with the rest of your team, building shared tooling for other engineers, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers.</p><p>Things You Might Do</p><p>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:</p><ul><li>Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to GraphQL, server-side React rendering, and Flow typing.</li><li>Build reusable React components with modular CSS, manage data on the client with Redux and GraphQL, and test everything with Jest.</li><li>Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPagetest, or custom tooling.</li><li>Refactor or improve existing code. We've migrated most of our frontend to React, but we still have some Backbone code to clean up. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code.</li><li>Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.</li><li>Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality.</li><li>Review code written by other team members or other teams.</li><li>Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.</li><li>Work with complex and varied data structures (APIs can be a little, uh, eccentric).</li><li>Help out with our Python backend or Node-based developer platform.</li><li>Share what you know and learn either one-on-one or with lightning talks to the group.</li><li>Give back to the community via open source and blog posts.</li><li>Experiment: this is a startup so everything can change as we experiment with doing more custom partnership work</li></ul><ul><li>As a part of Zapier's&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fzapier.com%2Flearn%2Fcustomer-support%2Feveryone-on-support%2F' rel='nofollow'>all-hands philosophy</a>, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.</li></ul><p>You’ll also have the opportunity to specialize in a variety of areas of the Zapier codebase, including core product or platform development. Focusing on a specialization will not limit your area for growth at Zapier as each engineer brings a unique perspective and can contribute differently in all areas. We encourage participation and will frequently have engineers contribute across teams to assist in projects.</p>                </div>            </div><div>How to apply:<br><a href='https://grnh.se/4a3f08fa2' rel='nofollow'>grnh.se/4a3f08fa2</a></div>",

This isn’t learning, it’s remembering, and it’s useless for equipping people with the practical skills and experience they need to face an ever-changing world. We believe in something better…</p><p>Social Constructionism is a learning-centred approach that prioritises exploring, making and iterating real-life&nbsp;STEAM&nbsp;projects in a social, collaborative way. Our award-winning pi-top laptop and pi-topCEED desktop computers are powered by the Raspberry Pi and come with a host of projects and accessories which allow any teacher, regardless of their computer literacy, to design fun and engaging lessons across&nbsp;STEAM&nbsp;subjects and beyond. Learners are empowered to work together, at their own pace, designing and refining their inventions by asking questions and ultimately Learning by Making.</p><p>Since our founding in 2014, we have built a strong global community of teachers and makers who constantly shape our worksheets, lesson plans and content. We provide access to hundreds of hours of educational resources for the Computer Science (CS) and&nbsp;STEAM&nbsp;curriculum that improves digital literacy.</p><p>However, we’ve only just got started, and this is where you come in. With secure funding in place, we’re poised to accelerate our growth and take our approach out to the world. Our roadmap for the next few years is going to be one hell of a ride, so there’s never been a better time to get onboard. We’re an open, honest and playful company made up of talented individuals from a variety of different backgrounds and places, all united in our commitment to positively improve the way we teach, learn and live.

We are part of the solution by providing essential tools for the Internet of choice. Our mission is to make it super easy and convenient for users to access content. Providing a running tab for all digital purchases across websites, currencies and platforms, and eliminating upfront registration and payment, is just the beginning.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>In our process, when a visitor reaches paid content or services, instead of having to complete a form and hand over a credit card, the user simply agrees to pay later and gets instant access to content. We track the user's content consumption, and after a monetary threshold is reached, we collect payment. By decoupling purchases from payments, LaterPay lowers the entry thresholds for users to consume digital goods. Our partners see a significant uplift in purchase conversions and simplify their billing and collections while offering a better user experience.</span><b><br></b></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>How we work</b></span></div><div>LaterPay has around 50 people spread over 12+ countries in time zones from UTC-8 to UTC+2.

Providing a running tab for all digital purchases across websites, currencies and platforms, and eliminating upfront registration and payment, is just the beginning.</span></div><div><br></div><div> <span>In our process, when a visitor reaches paid content or services, instead of having to complete a form and hand over a credit card, the user simply agrees to pay later and gets instant access to content. We track the user's content consumption, and after a monetary threshold is reached, we collect payment. By decoupling purchases from payments, LaterPay lowers the entry thresholds for users to consume digital goods. Our partners see a significant uplift in purchase conversions and simplify their billing and collections while offering a better user experience.</span><b><br></b></div><div> </div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>How we work</b></span></div><div>LaterPay has around 50 people spread over 12+ countries in time zones from UTC-8 to UTC+2.

    "content": "<span>Primitive Social | Full Stack Developer | Lubbock, TX | Full-Time | ONSITE or REMOTE<p>My employer in Lubbock, Texas is hiring a full stack developer experienced with Vue and Laravel. They're considering both local and remote candidates. It's been a positive experience for me and they place a lot of trust (and responsibility) in their developers to do good work. It has been helpful for me to be comfortable with independent work going into this role, and I believe a successful future team member would also be confident in their ability to take initiative in developing a new software product. The team is nothing but very genuine, helpful, and kind people who all work together very well. I've been 100% remote from the start and being remote has been a wonderful experience. My team has been very accommodating and cooperative despite the distance. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to work remotely as a developer, or for someone who values working with a team of good-hearted people.</p><p>Here's the Indeed posting which also includes the salary range for this position: <a href='https://www.indeed.com/job/full-stack-laravel-developer-97af846af530d00a' rel='nofollow'>https://www.indeed.com/job/full-stack-laravel-developer-97af...</a></p></span>",

By decoupling purchases from payments, LaterPay lowers the entry thresholds for users to consume digital goods.

That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$100K (mid-level), $100K-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We contribute to an HRA to offset the cost of health insurance or healthcare expenses.</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

The thought of solving a problem in an entirely new programming language, one you have never even heard of before, excites you.</li><li><strong>Technical Diversity</strong>: while we all have our preferences when it comes to programming languages or operating systems, you should be willing to work with anything, in any language, if that’s what it takes to get the job done. If you are easily lead into a “______ rocks, everything else sucks” mentality, this isn’t the job for you.</li><li><strong>Flexible</strong>: we are small, things change.

    "content": "_About SpeechKit_    <br /><br />SpeechKit is a fast-growing audio-as-a-service product for news publishers. We are building a complete toolkit to assist in the production, distribution and monetisation of audio content that will help digital news publishers reach new audiences and engage existing subscribers.<br /><br />Our business is reaching an inflection point and we are quickly onboarding new publishers by the day. This business is quickly evolving into an exciting new provider of a brand new format of news.<br /><br />We are a lean team in a phase of consolidation. This is an opportunity to join an early stage business in a high growth market providing the first of its kind service.<br /><br />_The Role_<br /><br />We are looking for a mid-level engineer with experience in leading a team in building B2B Saas products. Whilst the role is for the lead engineer in our team, we are looking for a candidate that not only has experience across our stack but also shows a willingness and enthusiasm to lead our product development through this exciting phase. <br /><br />The role will involve, but not be limited to, the following; <br /><br />* Helping define the product roadmap alongside CEO and COO.<br />* Ownership and responsibility for technical product development.<br />* Hands-on technical development across the stack.<br />* Leadership and management of the technical team.<br /><br />We currently rely heavily on contractual work for the majority of our development. It will be your job to transition from this model and lay the foundations for a team capable of sustaining our growth through the following years.<br /><br />_Core technology stack experience:_<br /><br />* Ruby on Rails 5.<br />* Python (RSS/URL text extraction).<br />* PHP (WordPress plugin development).<br />* Javascript, HTML, CSS.<br />* PostgreSQL.<br />* ELK (Elastic, Logstash, Kibana).<br />* AWS, DigitalOcean, Cloudflare, Heroku.<br /><br />_What would make you stand out;_<br /><br />* Experience and interest in machine learning and speech synthesis.<br />* Google NLP API expertise.<br />* Audio encoding know-how (ffmpeg and HLS).<br />* Background in statistics.<br />* Voice/sound design experience.<br />* Experience with media players and advertising standards e.g., VAAST and DAAST.<br />* Experience with smart speaker technology e.g., Alexa and Google Home.<br />* Mobile SDK development.<br />* React Native.<br /><br />_More about SpeechKit_<br /><br />We are a young team who have been chasing a vision for on-the-go audio news for the best part of a decade. The two founders have 10 years experience running startups between them and Speechkit is an evolution of two previous startups that has moulded a business we believe to have hit a sweet spot in an emerging market. <br /><br />We launched an MVP product in March this year and have experienced 30% growth month-on-month since that launch. We are now entering a phase of consolidation of the product, marketing and business process to ensure steady growth into the next phase of the business. <br /><br />We are well funded and ready to scale the team and business to mirror our growth prospects. Currently, we are working semi-remote and will be taking office space in mid-September. This role will be location flexible, meaning you will, for the most part, be able to manage your time working from the location of your choice or have a desk at the office. <br /><br />_Salary and Perks_<br /><br />This is an opportunity to join a dynamic and exciting business at its inception. We are looking to at a base salary for this role of £65,000 and will make judgements on an increase if expertise expands into relevant fields. Share options will also be negotiated after 3 months of the role. Holiday will start at 25 days, with flexible working location conditions. We will endeavour to meet any other suggestions you have for the role and its rewards.",

    "content": "<p>We’re looking for a smart and ambitious Front End Developer who wants to crush code and leave a legacy within the National Health Service. Sound intriguing? Read on....</p><h4><b>ABOUT MESSLY</b></h4><p>Our vision is to revolutionise medical training and recruitment within the NHS. We believe that the digital infrastructure supporting the training and recruitment of NHS doctors isn’t fit for purpose. If you know anything about the NHS, you won’t need convincing. The NHS is on it’s knees lurching from one workforce crisis to the next.</p><h4><b>WHAT'S THE SOLUTION?</b></h4><p>Messly's vision is to be the online home for all UK doctors - a single digital platform providing doctors with unified training resources and data, peer-peer connectivity and recruitment services across the whole of the NHS. By bringing all the doctors to one place, we can provide the NHS with world-class digital infrastructure to directly engage with the medical workforce for temporary and permanent work, skipping the agencies and enabling game-changing financial savings.</p><p>Yes this sounds lofty and ambitious. But let’s be clear, this isn’t a passion project to keep our minds whirring after a dull night shift. Here’s why we are fully committed and extremely confident that we can make this happen:</p><h4>1. OUR TRACTION AND GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY</h4><p>We’re already delivering - over the last 18 months we’ve built a medical network of over 10,000 doctors and medical students. That’s 15% of the junior medical workforce. We’ve got 6 NHS Trusts using our recruitment services and are generating revenue. Our business model is proven and scalable and we have clear roadmap of how we’re going to win over the hearts and minds of doctors.</p><h4>2. OUR TEAM</h4><p>We strongly believe a solid team is critical for success. So we’ve gone out and built a crack team of clinicians, developers, designers, commercial experts and marketeers. Our founders are close-friends with significant medical and commercial experience. Our tech team are rockstar coders with incredible design flair. Our ops are run by an ex-Amazon whiz. Supporting our troops are an advisory board made up of some of the most well-connected entrepreneurs and healthcare experts, who are helping to embed Messly within the healthcare ecosystem. We’ve been backed by all leading healthcare innovation hubs including DigitalHealth.London, NHS Clinical Entrepreneurs Programme and InnovateUK.</p><h4>3. OUR FUNDING</h4><p>We’ve raised over £1,000,000 to focus on building the best digital tools and services for our doctors and NHS. Quite simply we can more patient and long-term than anyone else in the market to realise our bold vision.</p><h4>THE ROLE</h4><p>We're looking to hire a smart, curious, and enthusiastic front end developer who wants to make a name for themselves by building something something extraordinarily beautiful and functional. There'll be a lot of greenfield coding opportunities and you'll have the opportunity to retain full ownership of your code.</p><p>We're a young company, so you'll need to get your hands dirty and no two weeks will be the same. You will, of course, need to define your own work proactively and take ownership of the outputs. The ability to cope with uncertainty and rapid change is crucial.</p><p>We have a very flat hierarchy - you'll be working directly with our founders and CTO.</p><h4>ABOUT YOU</h4><p>You're smart, ambitious, like a challenge and are looking to move into a very rapidly growing startup order to fast-track your career. You're frustrated by slow-moving, process-heavy situations and excited by moving fast to solve challenging problems and delight customers. You'd like the opportunity to work in a varied role with responsibility and the scope for rapid personal development and change.</p><h4>REQUIREMENTS:</h4><p>1 or more years experience of JS front end development.</p><p>Experience developing with React.JS.</p><p>Knowledge of CSS and HTML.</p><p>UX/UI experience - including responsive/mobile design.</p><p>Portfolio of existing work to discuss.</p><h4>DESIRABLE TRAITS:</h4><p>Familiarity with functional programming.</p><h4>BENEFITS</h4><p>Highly competitive salary (based on experience) as well as other incentives where appropriate.</p><p>Very flexible working</p><p>Travel / development expenses.</p><p>Not one but two part-time office dogs.</p><p>Free (and frankly pretty good) barista coffee.</p><p>The role is full-time. Our offices are based in South West London, but we're open to flexible working as suits you and the role you'd like to create. Full-time remote working is an option - including for individuals who are based outside of the UK.</p>",

You will experience technical challenges, quick decisions, excited users and many possibilities. Our stack is VueJS, GoLang, SASS and Google Cloud at the moment, but please challenge us to think otherwise.</p><p>Some months ago we launched a platform for digital user testing, raised 10m NOK and already we're working with some of Scandinavias biggest companies and fastest growing startups. Companies can set up their own tests quickly and easily, and get video results, where testers within a chosen demographic have recorded their screen, face and voice, using our chrome extension. We’re currently also in the process of developing recording technology for iOS and Android, and we're currently testing natural language processing, speech to text and facial analysis, to make video analysis faster for companies in the future.</p><p><em>PS: If you're applying from out of country, we can help relocate to Oslo, Norway. Or even remote for the right candidate.</em></p><p>Our product helps product people make better and more informed decisions on what to prioritise, build and develop further. We’re passionate about making a product that our users love to use, and as user friendly as possible, so that 80 year old Anne can do a test on her phone from her couch.</p><h3>How will you work?</h3><p>We’re moving fast, and as an frontend developer you will have a lot of freedom and autonomy to work in the way you prefer. That also includes responsibility and that you’re comfortable making decisions and can solve problems in an efficient manner.</p><h3>What will you work with?</h3><ul><li>Build out new features using Vue components with the guidance of other team members for specifications. Our features include complexities like RBAC and handling things like communication with our chrome extension, HTML5 video/audio, and displaying output of AI/NLP backend processes.</li><li>Extend and improve on our design system</li><li>Contribute to how Teston looks and behaves</li><li>Refactor of existing components to be easily testable and easier to re-use.</li><li>Maintain and refactor an existing Vue store that interacts with our RESTful API.</li><li>Help maintain/implement a test framework for unit testing existing and new components.</li><li>Look for small things that can make a big difference in the UX, for instance a transition or a function that will make a user smile. We want to make products that people will love to use.</li></ul><p>PS: We're currently expanding into english speaking countries and Sweden.</p>                </div><a href='https://jobs.teston.io/frontend-developer/en/apply' rel='nofollow'>Apply now!</a>",

Our vision is a borderless network of farmers and retailers - no matter what size or region - who work together to overcome current and future challenges of digitization. Our core features include digital channels to trade agricultural inputs and in-depth data analytics and benchmarking functionalities about individual trading economics. Agricultural trading today is characterised by analogue and cumbersome processes and a fundamental lack of transparency. We are creating a future for farmers and retailers in which they are able to share data in an anonymous and secure way, work together and do business smarter.                    </div><div>                    <h2>Job description</h2>                    <p>We’re looking for a Senior Front End Engineer that has a passion for hacking, building and owning a great product with high-end customer facing features, internal tools and experiences that help us and our customers become smarter. You have a proven track record of writing clean and performant code with emphasis on user accessibility.</p><p><strong>Why you should work with us</strong></p><p>Agrando is a project absolutely dear to our heart. We act by conviction in order to contribute to the progress of agriculture. Our main cause is to support the farmer because in the end, it's all about mutual care and cooperation. Agriculture is our home and our origin and we speak from our own experience and know about the specific needs, which makes us the perfect partner for the agricultural trading of the next centuries. We want to push the agricultural trade forward using state of the art technologies and constantly stay in motion by taking one step at a time while being excited about everything that comes along. Working with us means to make a difference and to help us developing a meaningful product that in the end has an impact on the future of sustainable agriculture and thus the food you eat everyday.</p><p><strong>What you should bring</strong></p><ul><li>Great communication skills, ability to work in an agile team and workflow experience (git-flow, scrum, etc.)</li><li>2+ years proven JS work experience in a professional or institutional environment (including usage of node/npm/yarn)</li><li>Demonstrable experiences with Vue.js (or at least one out of the following: Backbone/Ember/Angular/React)</li><li>Demonstrated facility in a HTML/CSS/SASS/LESS environment</li><li>General understanding of core computer programming, distributed systems, logic &amp; cloud infrastructure</li><li>Open-mindedness and an attitude that encourages nurturing your skills, learning new ones while at the same time passing on knowledge in areas you excel</li><li>Passion for writing quality, high-performance and maintainable code following best practices by heart</li><li>Farming experience (just joking but having played Farming Simulator does count)</li></ul><p><strong>What to expect</strong></p><p>As a <em>Senior Front End Engineer</em> at Agrando you will support us in the creation of our SPA frontend for the stakeholders on our trading platform (farmers, retailers, producers). You will make technologies or frameworks like Jest, Bulma and SASS work for you and learn about how to contribute to our CI/CD Pipelines supporting our DevOps specialists. Most importantly, you will deep dive into latest JavaScript frameworks since our frontend core is based on <strong>Vue.js</strong>, <strong>Nuxt.js</strong> (apart from having an SPA part we also use SSR on top of Vue), Vuex, Axios, REST APIs and GraphQL. You will improve the UX and UI together with our Designers and guide them in their implementation efforts to align the product to their design philosophies. On the other hand, you will directly influence decisions supporting our DevOps, Analytics, Design and Product Department while keeping yourself in sync with the Sales &amp; Marketing team.</p><p>Since future logic is also driven by our data intensive infrastructure it is a plus if you want to get in touch with other parts of our product like our BI &amp; Big Data Pipeline (GCP) and Machine Learning strategies. We constantly explore latest technologies to find the best solutions to our next-gen problems - thus hacking around and bringing in your own ideas is something we highly encourage.</p><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><ul><li>Remote &amp; Flexible: It is possible to work from home if physical presence is not needed and we have a non-clock-watching culture.</li><li>Events Around the Globe: Since we are an aspiring AgTech Startup you can join us on various Trips, Conventions, Conferences (We just went to Vue.js Amsterdam and it has been a total blast), Tech Fairs, Trade Shows and other Events around the World, related to our business or the technologies involved.</li><li>Make a Difference: In the end we try to save our farmers money by purchasing agricultural inputs more cost-efficiently, which in turn can save farms with less revenues than production costs from bankruptcy (e.g. coming from low milk prices), while at the same time enabling private suppliers to compete and advance in the digitized agricultural trade of the future.</li><li>Equity Grants: We grant incentives (company shares) to employees that influence and push our company success in the long-term.</li><li>Advanced Training: At Agrando we believe in nurturing our skills through proper knowledge management and personal development. We encourage our employees to learn, teach and improve also through advanced trainings, workshops, (hosted) meetups or other external activities and provide them with the best resources (Udemy for Business, Nanodegrees from Udacity) for free.</li><li>Additional Benefits: Weapons of choice (MBP etc.), Coffee &amp; Beer, Organic Fruits &amp; YumYum Soups, SNES &amp; XBOX360 Gaming</li></ul><p><strong>Social</strong></p><ul><li>Frequent weißwurst breakfasts (Max Muniger Gold - best weißwurst in town)</li><li>Agrando summer &amp; winter parties</li><li>Mandatory Agrando-Tables at the Oktoberfest &amp; Frühlingsfest</li><li>We are not your average team - there are no fancy HR phrases that could properly describe our working atmosphere and team spirit. Everyone is passionate about the company and our cause and we do our best every day. Although we distance ourselves from the hip berlin-casual-startup-family-work-hard-party-hard-stuff, we are more than colleagues and Agrando is more than just our workplace. An employee turnover of 0% should speak for itself but believe us when we say that within the first few weeks we will win your heart!</li></ul>                </div><a href='mailto:hueber@agrando.de' rel='nofollow'>Apply now!</a>",

We’re moving our customers away from manual spreadsheets, tedium and stress - to a radically new platform with simple UI, infinite scalability and beautiful code.</p><p>Spun out of a multi-billion dollar listed company, and led by entrepreneurs and developers with a proven history in startups, our biggest challenge is making complicated flows, or technical configuration, easy and enjoyable for our users. Our MVP launch will be in early 2019, with frequent rollouts of features indefinitely thereafter.</p><p>We are putting together a frontend development team of crack javascript developers, led by our experienced Director of UX. We are after at least two competent, experienced and technical javascript developers to join our fun, hard-working team. We can accommodate a range of experience, but are ideally after one senior and one junior developer. All applicants should have decent knowledge of a framework such as React, Angular or Vue - however we are set on using the latter and you must be willing to immerse yourself in it, if you are not already.</p><p>You will be based either in our Coworking office at Paddington (WeWork), or our Coworking space in Sofia (Betahaus). We can be flexible with home-working, but some office-based work is essential for this collaborative project.</p><p><strong>Our Stack</strong></p><p>Upmind is an API-first SAAS application, which means our backend handles all logic and exposes a RESTful API. This backend is built on modern cloud technology (largely AWS, though some Google - Firebase &amp; Compute - also). As we develop further, we are microservicing components in such a way that we may be able to offer them as standalone products in the future.</p><p>The backend also makes use of Laravel and NodeJS. We use a combination of SNS and RabbitMQ for messaging, and MySQL/Firestore/DynamoDB for databases. These stack choices are fluid and subject to challenge from any member of staff – for example, if a new product offering from a cloud provider were to emerge. We encourage everyone to speak up and have a say; we only want to hire people who bring something extra to the team.</p><p>At Upmind we are great advocates for open source technology, and a substantial portion of our software will be released under GNU GPL3.</p><p>Our frontend is built out as a single page application (SPA) atop the Vue JS framework – utilising a number of Vue's core libraries including VueRouter and VueX. Coupled with Bulma, a modern and responsive CSS framework, our primary focus is to deliver a clean, friendly and performant customer experience.</p><p>Joining this team you will have the opportunity to work with some of the latest (and most exciting) frontend technologies, be part of a truly agile workforce and impact the way we work by collectively reviewing and improving processes.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Create world-class UI solutions which impress</li><li>Write clean and componentised code, that is reusable and remains efficient at scale</li><li>Work with our chosen tech: Vue, VueRouter, VueX, Webpack, Buefy</li><li>Write tests to validate your work (Karma/Jest/Nightwatch etc)</li><li>Help define and enforce team standards (formatting, documentation, naming conventions etc)</li><li>Translate wireframes and designs into beautiful and compact code</li><li>Ensure users have enjoyable, simple experiences - even within complex flows</li><li>Be vocal with criticism of systems, code and functionality you find fault with</li><li>Be a team-player: both within your direct function and outside it</li><li>Maintain the stack – keep on top of dependency vulnerabilities, version releases etc</li><li>Keep abreast of new technologies, tools and products which could benefit the business</li></ul><p><strong>Person Specification</strong></p><ul><li>You have 3+ years commercial frontend development experience</li><li>You have worked in an agile development environment</li><li>You have an expert knowledge of Javascript/ES6</li><li>You have working experience of Vue JS or other similar frameworks (React/Angular)</li><li>You have working experience with build tools such as Webpack</li><li>You can write tests to validate your work (Karma/Jest/Nightwatch)</li><li>You are driven and can take ownership of your day-to-day responsibilities</li><li>You have great communication skills</li><li>You like to build great products whilst having fun</li></ul><p><strong>Desirable</strong></p><ul><li>Experience working on mid-to-large scale SPAs</li><li>Experience with Cloud technologies such as Google Firebase, Google Compute, Google Pub/Sub, AWS Lambda etc</li><li>A good eye for design and understanding of responsive considerations</li><li>A willingness to educate and mentor team members</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive salary, based on experience.</li><li>A fun but hard-working meritocratic environment, surrounded by a technical, pragmatic and focused team.</li><li>Premium office space, with free hot, cold and alcoholic drinks.

We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable.

Arctoris helps cancer researchers to make progress and discoveries faster and more efficiently, so that together we can make cancer a disease that no longer needs to be feared.<br /><br />As the latest member of our team of ten and third developer, you’ll be joining the startup at an exciting stage. We have brought on board a world-class team of engineers, cancer researchers, and machine learning experts and are backed by leading investors. You’ll have a huge influence on how both the product and the team grow in the coming months & years.<br /><br />You will work in a very hands-on way on the project, writing lots of actual code and working closely with our current junior developer and another senior IT expert, with the opportunity to step back and take a more product/ managerial/ team lead approach as the project and team expand. <br /><br />The immediate focus of this role will be the continued development of our Angular web app which customers use to interact with our service. You’ll be adding new features and refining the existing product, while contributing to broader strategy as well. <br /><br />As we are a small and open team who strive not to live hierarchies, you can gain a lot of insight into the overall functioning of the company and its various departments and projects, and can incorporate this knowledge into the digital strategy where applicable. We actively encourage this cross pollination of ideas. <br /><br />Being excited by the prospect of taking on real responsibility and having a genuine impact is essential. If you make a compelling argument for implementing a particular strategy or technology or any other idea, it will be taken seriously from day one. You have the chance to lay the track, build the train, and drive it. <br /><br />Working as part of the Arctoris team is more like a group project than a standard 9 to 5. There are no fixed hours and the only requirement is that you work closely with our current developers for as much time as you see fit, with the option to work remotely for at least part of the time as well. Much of your time in the first months will be sharing knowledge between you to move the project forward. <br /><br />There is enormous freedom in how you approach a problem and organise your workday, so a taste for independence is a must. You’ll have the opportunity to wear many hats and see your ideas manifest right from the off. <br /><br />Key Tasks<br />Work closely with our current developers to grow and improve our current product, primarily using Angular 6 and AWS. Our next step is the integration of data mining/analysis and visualisation into the product. <br />Writing actual code and doing code reviews<br />Pooling knowledge and experience with the current developer<br />Bringing prior experience of development and project management to bear on current problems<br />Working effectively with the digital agency that provide the back end, as well as any other collaborators<br /><br />Ideal Candidate: <br />Strong interest in the company mission, motivated by the prospect of having a real impact in an important field<br />Ability to distil complex issues down to their core elements<br />Structured working style with the ability to derive and evaluate strategic options<br />Excellent communication - for sharing ideas, explaining concepts, identifying potential problems.<br />Happy to wear many hats; this will involve much more than just coding <br />Genuine interest in the company and how it works as whole, highly curious in general<br /><br />Technical Experience<br />Attitude is the most important part, rather than specific languages or tech<br />Experience with Javascript and some of its many frameworks with Redux/ngrx architecture (preferably Angular 2 or above) <br />Strong knowledge of software architecture and best practices<br />A solid understanding of how web applications work, particularly front end architecture incorporating security, session management and database interaction<br />Comfortable picking up new technologies and immediately implementing them<br />Experience of the “bigger picture” i.e. some Product and Architecture experience<br />General tendency to build things the right way for long term stability, not rushing to produce something to show<br /><br />Bonus<br />Interest in the science and research behind the company<br />Experience with database management systems<br />Experience growing a tech team and product from an early stage<br />Contributions to open source<br />Experience in Angular 6, Elm, AWS, Python, data visualisation<br />Experience in driving digitisation of general company processes and operations<br /><br />Salary<br />£35 - 70k dependent on experience<br />ESOP/ employee stock option plan",

We're helping dentists capture hundreds of thousands of dollars more than with legacy tools through schedule optimization and improved claims management--and no, that's not just hype, it's real. We've just landed a $16M Series A, led by Accel, Eight Roads Ventures and F-Prime Capital Partners, and we're expanding our development team from India to the United States. The company has product-market fit and our onboarding pipeline has filled up nicely. Now it's up to the engineering team to really turn the product into something special--something that our customers are delighted to pay us for. Having that kind of product-market fit so early and reducing a lot of it to technical problems is a different situation than a lot of startups at this stage, but it makes things a whole lot more fun.</p><p>Right now, we're in need of product-minded senior and principal-level frontend developers who have a track record of making sustainable long-term decisions. Our stack is .NET (though .NET experience isn't required) and Angular 1/TypeScript; the future of the usual frontend may be a modern version of Angular or a move to React, and it's largely up to the leaders of our frontend team to decide. (Our mobile work will probably be React Native.) In addition to technical and architectural competence, a big part of the role is helping to socialize good practices to our existing developer base as well as to forge ahead with the usual: new features, performance and stability improvements, and the like.</p><p>As for me, I'm the Director of Infrastructure here--I was impressed enough by the company and the team to wind down my consulting business to come here. For those of you who know me from HN, you know that I'm big on generosity, kindness, and <i>competence</i>, and I'm happy to say that this team is better at all of the above than any team I've ever worked with in the past. We all teach; we all learn. It is a pleasure to come into work everyday.</p><p>Our team is primarily Boston-centric--I was the first engineer hired into this office, we're up to 7 local now. We do offer relocation for the right candidates and we will consider remote hires.</p><p>eropple@carestack.com - put &quot;[HN WHO'S HIRING]&quot; in the subject line.</p></span>",
