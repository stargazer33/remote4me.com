We’re not just doing reporting - our product is an end-to-end retail analytics stack.

Therapists (physios, sports therapists etc) are trained to treat not run so need support to reach their business and clinical goals. Equally, as it’s such a confusing market the average member of the public sees three of more therapists before they find the right one costing them a lot of time money and frustration.</p><p>With increasing NHS delays and a population that is having to be more active the demand for private practice treatment is increasing every day. Therapists benefit from technical solutions we provide to make their job easier, more efficient and more effective.</p><p>We are fully funded, revenue generating and fast growing.</p><p><b>The role will involve: </b></p><p>You would be working with a highly experienced Technical Director on an exciting fast-growing platform business using advanced cloud technologies.</p><p>Your role would live and breathe the front end, implementing new features whilst maintaining and improving existing ones. We work very much as a team with the business and the technical side working closely together and a flat management structure so all views and opinions are valued.Whilst initially the role would be office based to get up to speed then we are big believers in the work getting done in the most effective way so there are opportunities for remote and flexible working.</p><p><b>Required: </b></p><ul><li>You are competent in VueJS and Axios. Other reactive frameworks are accepted, but VueJS is our choice.</li><li>You see the limitations of jQuery and are keen to step away from it (or avoid it).</li><li>You have good experience with either Foundation, Bootstrap, Tailwind, or any other such framework.</li><li>You are annoyed by inconsistencies. Why is the primary button on the left, whereas it’s on the right everywhere else? Why is the margin 6rem here where it’s 4rem there?</li><li>You test in all browsers and think mobile-first. Microsoft Edge is a big improvement but still has its little fusses.</li><li>You have your own side projects which you’d love to show us.</li><li>You know your way around the element inspector or have a wealth of tools you prefer to use to really see what’s going on.</li><li>You are familiar, but careful with NPM, Yarn etc. We won’t expect you to define the toolchain as we have one, but feel free to improve it. Likewise, you give each library careful consideration rather than wildly installing dependencies.</li><li>You use js-lint, css-lint, though we can get you up to speed with these if not.</li></ul><p><b>What you can expect from us: </b></p><ul><li>We love being up to date with current frameworks and approaches. We learn from and teach each other such.</li><li>You will gain very strong industry experience with expected front-end tools under your belt. If this sounds like you already, your tools will be sharpened.</li><li>A fun, ambitious team with a lot of interesting features on the way which you will be a core part of.</li><li>Whilst we work hard, we also respect working smart rather than long. A nasty case of burnout won’t get us very far.</li></ul><p><b>Benefits: </b></p><ul><li>Flexible working: time and location</li><li>Pension</li><li>An amazing office right next to Cardiff Central Station with all the benefits that brings including free tea/coffee etc.</li><li>Healthcare: free physiotherapy treatment and personal training.</li></ul><p><b>Salary</b></p><ul><li>£22,000-£25,000 dependent on experience</li></ul><p>Job Type: Full-time</p><p>Salary: £22,000.00 to £25,000.00 /year</p><p>Experience:</p><ul><li>Web Development: 1 year (Preferred)</li><li>VueJs: 1 year (Preferred)</li><li>JavaScript: 1 year (Preferred)</li></ul></div><div><div><div><span></span></div><span>Cardiff CF10</span></div><div><div><span></span></div><span>£22,000 - £25,000 a year</span></div></div>",

For this role we are looking for a &quot;full stack&quot; generalist who has the experience and interest to be our team's frontend expert.</strong></p><p>Zymergen’s Automation team is building the technology for a reconfigurable, highly automated <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbXOIuTvEJ8' rel='nofollow'><em>industrial microbe factory</em></a>. Combined with the work done by our colleagues who are geneticists, data scientists, research associates, and many other disciplines, our work leads to new chemicals with properties <a href='https://youtu.be/1X9Npq2eQxo?t=275' rel='nofollow'><em>unlike anything that can be derived from petroleum</em></a>.</p><h4><strong>ABOUT THE JOB</strong></h4><p>You will contribute to the code that controls the many different <a href='https://medium.com/@ZymergenTechBlog/the-case-for-modular-lab-automation-c34f214e1276' rel='nofollow'><em>types of machinery that make up our microbe factory</em></a>, adding support for new equipment types, improving the user interfaces for scientists, scaling the scheduling software to support larger transport systems, improving observability tools to monitor the factory, and generally working towards support for more complex automated workflows.</p><p>We call this role “Software Engineer” and not “Automation Engineer” on purpose: Our tech stack combines a modern web tech stack with a few cherry-picked components you’d find in a traditional process control system. Our codebase currently contains REST APIs served by Django apps, Vue.js for user interfaces (and simple Django forms with sprinkles of jQuery for others), Python’s asyncio in worker processes, and a collection of device drivers (also written in Python). Our infrastructure includes Kubernetes, Puppet-managed EC2 nodes, Kafka, MySQL, as well as a few Windows machines and PLCs.</p><p>The project you will start on has been in flight for two years. Some days you will be working on a brand new service to add a major new feature. On other days you will be fixing bugs or troubleshooting misbehaving robots in production (you might be wearing a lab coat). We use two-week sprints to structure our work, with every team member being responsible for keeping track of one or two ongoing efforts. Who works on what is driven just as much by our current skills as by what we want to learn.</p><p>One specific area our team is trying to get better at is frontend development and we hope that you can play a role in that. Be prepared to spend 50% or more of your time designing and implementing user interfaces. All our users are internal to Zymergen: They include scientists who need to tell the robots what to work on, support engineers who troubleshoot misbehaving robots, and managers who rely on <a href='https://medium.com/@ZymergenTechBlog/visualizing-automation-usage-at-zymergen-970440a58568' rel='nofollow'><em>utilization data from our dashboards</em></a>.</p><h4><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></h4><p>You have several years of experience working in technical software development role (SWE, SRE, web dev, etc). We do not expect you to have prior experience in the biotech industry or in working with robots. To make sure we can get you up to speed quickly on those things, you’ll need to bring a solid fundamental knowledge and recent hands-on experience with software development, working in a team, and the two foundational languages in our tech stack: Javascript and Python.</p><p>You might have a CS degree, or not. (If you do, you would be the first team member who has one.) We want to hear the stories about how you used your skills in thoughtful and interesting ways, whether you learned them in a school or elsewhere.</p><p>We are looking for a software engineer who cares about the product we are building at least as much as the code they are writing. Nobody gets micromanaged in our team, even junior engineers own complete problems and participate in architecture decisions and project management. Because you join the team as an experienced engineer, we expect you to be comfortable dealing with ambiguity and ready to mentor others to become excellent at it too.</p><p>In addition to writing code every day, you will review the work of others both at the design and implementation stage, design significant new features and infrastructure from scratch, and help maintain and prioritize our backlog and road map. When we deploy our work to a prototype system, you will be hands on with testing and troubleshooting, even in situations when it’s not clear if the problem is software or hardware or biology.</p><p>You will be the sixth member of a team of people who are excited to both introduce you to our tech and to learn from you! When you arrive, we will have an onboarding plan that gets you ready for working on critical path features and the gnarliest bugs within two or three months. We will save you a spot in the schedule for our biweekly chalk talk lineup, too!</p><p>A note on logistics: This is <em>not</em> a remote job. At least some of your work will involve (expensive!) machines which are located in our laboratories in Emeryville, CA. Emeryville is one of the biotech hubs in the Bay Area’s “tech industry” and easy to commute to: Zymergites bicycle or ride public transit from Berkeley and Oakland, take the train or company shuttle from the South Bay, and BART or drive from SF. We don’t have fixed working hours: Most of us meet in the office on most weekdays. Most meetings happen between 11am and 4pm, if you work from home you can always videocall in.</p><p>Legal authorization to work in the U.S. is required. Zymergen may agree to sponsor an individual for an employment visa now or in the future if there is a shortage of individuals with particular skills for this job. In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification form upon hire.</p>                </div><a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_app?for=zymergen&amp;token=1754529' rel='nofollow'>Apply now!</a>",

Emulating the models of Netflix and Goodreads we're building robust discovery mechanisms, data-driven recommendations, and next generation tools to engage with theatre and other performing arts.</p><p>We are looking for a Frontend or Full-stack Engineer to join us, ideally on a full-time basis, to help us continue to scale and enhance our theatre discovery platform. We're really proud of the product we've built, are getting great response from our users and the theatre industry and have had over 3k users in just a few weeks. We have a clear, exciting roadmap of enhancements and innovations ahead of us and are looking to add more bench strength to an already strong team so we can accelerate progress. </p><p>Our team:</p><p>We're a pretty focused and skilled bunch (ex-Amazon, Adidas, fintech, BBC, etc.), based in London. We love feedback and collaboration and have lots of exciting problems to solve, so would love to find someone that cares about our mission: to remove barriers-to-entry for potential theatre-goers and be the most trusted way to access theatre. We're based in London's South Bank and have weekday access to a stunning, unique co-working space.</p><p>You:</p><p>Ideally you care deeply about clean code, scalable solutions and delivering scrappy but error-free enhancements for users. So ideally looking for someone with deep experience in quickly implementing straightforward solutions. We are not interested in hiring a dispersed remote team that we can't get to know or actively collaborate with - we need you to bring your passion, problem-solving and curiosity to our work. Our diversity of perspectives helps us find and implement the best solutions. Ideally you have deep experience in React and single-page web apps, and experience/willingness to dive in on Next.js. Backend is Python/Django, infrastructure is AWS and we're very open to full-stack generalists provided the frontend skills are strong. Experience with Auth0, Prismic CMS, FB social plugin integrations, or SendGrid/email all helpful as well.</p><p>Where we're at:</p><p>Our beta is exceeding all expectations so we've doubled down on speed, and thus posting this role. Exciting times. Thespie is a disruptive model in our space, so continuing to improve the platform and deliver on our roadmap is essential - but unrealistic timelines, angst and blame are not part of the equation. We're heads down on building and moving fast because we love what we do, and have big things we need to deliver for theatre-goers.</p><p>If the above sounds like you - or you're excited about what we're doing, please apply and/or connect! We love meeting new people interested in the problems we're solving.</p>",

The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry.

Localize automatically deploys those translations to the customer's production site.</p><p>We're hiring a Product Designer to own &amp; shape the customer experience. You'll oversee new functionality from early concept, to wireframe, to prototype/mockup, to pixel-perfect design and launch.

You have the perfect balance of left and right brain, with an eye for great dynamic industrial style and the mind to implement the complex logic to drive it. HTML/CSS/ES6 are second-nature to you, you are equally comfortable with CSS keyframes and HTML Canvas as well as Javascript asynchronous functions and DOM manipulation.</p><p>You are very adaptable, and know that there is no single way or right way to develop. You understand that the endsare more important than the means, and the endswill forever evolve and always introduce new challenges. You don’t hesitate to abandon code or methodology in favor of something new that better solves the current problem. You thrive in doing something that has never been done before.</p><p>Adacado client-side applications contain most of our business rules, and you will be expected to design, implement, and maintain complicated business logic as per our architecture. Your designs and code will be expected to effectively manage data efficacy, data versioning, and all calls to our various APIs.</p><p>As a developer at Adacado you will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new features in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis. You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of constant group learning as we exchange expertise and experience with each other. You have no problems spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill. You understand that the best tool for the job is teamwork.</p><p>The Adacado Platform</p><p>The Adacado SAAS platform (and its roadmap) creates many interesting technical challenges.

We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource.</p><p>We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours, and a generous skills-development/education budget. All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun!)</p><p>Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit. Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks. We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.</p><p>Location</p><p>This is role is based in our Vancouver office and applicants must be eligible to work in Canada.

We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.</p><p>We're a stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.</p><p>Our team is composed of open-source enthusiasts, former audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going, fun-loving, dedicated folks.</p><p>About you:</p><p>- You know that product development goes off the rails without rapid, early feedback from real users.</p><p>- You believe that &quot;looks great&quot; does not necessarily equal &quot;feels great&quot;, and that the latter is higher priority (but your favorite applications accomplish both!).</p><p>- You feel that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture. Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.</p><p>- You're annoyed that modern websites ship megabytes of unnecessary dependencies to user's browsers. You're painfully aware of the difference between &quot;DRY&quot; as an important guiding principle of software development, and &quot;DRY&quot; as a cargo-cult mentality used to justify lazy over-coupling of code.</p><p>- You simultaneously hate and love Javascript, and are excited about various LLVM-based languages' recent progress targeting WebAssembly.</p><p>- You have a battle-tested workflow for debugging performance issues and deciding which layer of the stack merits optimization.</p><p>- You sigh at bullet-pointed job descriptions that try to prescribe visceral emotional reactions to technical opinions.</p><p>Outside of the browser, our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. Our nascent tooling for serving data to the browser is written in Julia as well. We're still experimenting with various parts of our tech stack, however - come help us make the right decisions!</p><p>Contact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.</p><p>P.S. We're also hiring for Lead Android and Lead DevOps roles!</p>",

We operate in over 250 cities: from Sydney to Tokyo to London to New York.</p><br /><p>We believe time is valuable and you should be able to make the most of it. We focused on simplicity, security and scalability, to create an innovative service accessible to everyone.</p><br /><p>Stasher is one of London&rsquo;s fastest growing startups. Venture backed by the likes of Wayra (Telefonica), VentureFriends.vc and HOWZAT partners, Stasher is on an exciting mission to improve the experience of travelling. Winners of Expedia&rsquo;s inaugural travel startup competition, Stasher also won Pitch@Palace 10.0 in Buckingham Palace and was named Travolution and VisitEngland&rsquo;s Startup of the Year.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>About the team / tech:</strong></p><br /><p>The main app is built with the isomorphic Next.js React framework but has a lot of custom work on top of it. We use Redux and React hooks and try to stay as cutting edge as possible without sacrificing stability or code scalability. We also have a few smaller projects and internal tools and have recently launched webview apps on both iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We're pretty happy with our current tech core, but for the next phase we&rsquo;re focusing a lot more on speed, scalability and reliability which may require quite a bit of refactoring. We are considering rebuilding the core booking flow as a PWA, for offline support and all the other goodies, and building React Native apps to replace the webview ones.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re running Python (Flask) and PostgreSQL on the backend and use Heroku for hosting as well as Cloudflare and a myriad other services for infrastructure.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Who are we looking for:</strong></p><br /><p>We are looking for a mid-level frontend developer to work with our frontend team on developing our website (React) and associated tools - and potentially apps (React native).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Beside the technical requirements, you need to be able to work collaboratively and communicate your ideas and decisions to tech and non tech people alike. We&rsquo;re still a small team, so you need to be fairly independent and confident in making your own decisions.</p><br /><p>The below is a guideline but it&rsquo;s not a strict requirement to tick all the boxes:</p><br /><p>- 2+ years experience in a frontend role<br />- Good understanding of React app architecture and current frontend ecosystem<br />- Reasonable understanding of backend technologies (databases, python, APIs)<br />- Experience with Next.js is a plus<br />- Experience with unit tests is a plus<br />- Startup experience is a plus</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Perks:</strong></p><br /><p>Stock options &ndash; share in the success that we build!<br />25 days holiday + bank holidays + 1 extra day holiday per year with Stasher.<br />Equipment and learning budget<br />Great workspace in Shoreditch<br />WFH options<br />Regular team socials &ndash; sometimes abroad!<br />Drinks each friday<br />Lots of free fruit and food at office + team meals</p>",

    "content": "<h1><strong>About us</strong></h1><br /><p>We are on a journey to make pet healthcare more accessible, and we want you to help us! Did you know that only 8% of health issues are seen by a veterinary professional? In real numbers: pets experience 24 issues per year, but only 2 of them make it to the vet. This isn&rsquo;t because people are bad at being pet owners &mdash; going to the vet can be expensive, and takes a lot of effort, and sometimes it&rsquo;s even embarrassing. We want to remove all these barriers that stop pet parents from seeking expert care so that our pets can live the long and healthy lives they deserve.</p><br /><p>Our mission is to empower vets to advocate for their patients wherever and whenever suits them. Our current product provides an app-based approach that allows vets to interact with their patients through a combination of chat and video consultations. The future holds lots of exciting opportunities to expand this into the go-to app for all things pet care related. Gula recently raised a pre-seed round of funding, and off the back of that, we are looking to build the beginnings of our product team, which is where you come in. With a goal like allowing pets to live healthier lives, a fantastic experience across all our user facing products is going to be key to overcoming challenges in changing the way pet owners think about how they interact with their care providers.</p><br /><p>Our customer facing products right now are in the form of iOS &amp; Android apps written in React Native, with a web-app soon to follow. We use AWS for much of our backend functionality;&nbsp; Lambda, DynamoDB, and Elasticsearch underpin our API, providing a <em>blazing fast</em>&nbsp; experience for our users. We also use various other cloud services like Pusher, Twilio, and Stripe for added areas of functionality. Our backend code is written in JavaScript right now, but we are open to any language that is suitable for the job, and we have experience deploying Python and Rust services to production.</p><br /><h1><strong>Who we&rsquo;re looking for</strong></h1><br /><p>Gula&rsquo;s CTO, Will, is the sole engineer. You would be working with him day-to-day which gives you the opportunity to help architect the ways of working in the product team and put in place what we would consider to be best practices. As the engineering team is in its infancy, you will be responsible for all things tech. While this seems broad, it would be a great opportunity for somebody looking to make their mark on an engineering organisation. Here are some projects you might work on in the next six months:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Building a membership management section across BE &amp; FE.</li><br /><li>Rebuilding our website so it speaks to our target customers better.</li><br /><li>Architect a complete CI/CD solution for our BE services.</li><br /><li>Building a component library to be used across our native and web apps.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>React Native experience is not necessary, but it will be where a lot of your work is based right now. You might be perfect for this role if most of these apply to you:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have extensive experience with React or a similar technology</li><br /><li>You have built responsive web apps</li><br /><li>You consider a close relationship with the UX team mandatory for building great products</li><br /><li>You have worked in a start-up</li><br /><li>You have experience working with languages other than JavaScript</li><br /><li>You would describe yourself as an animal lover</li><br /><li>You are happy working autonomously</li><br /><li>You love learning new things</li><br /></ul><br /><h1><strong>Application process</strong></h1><br /><p>Once we have reviewed your CV and have decided that we could be a great mutual match, we&rsquo;d start with a short phone call or coffee to tell you more about what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve at Gula long-term and also to give you some more details about the role. Then if successful there would be a final stage where we&rsquo;d spend some more time talking about technical topics, and you would meet Gula&rsquo;s CEO Thom to find out more about our values and to see if you&rsquo;d fit in.</p><br /><h1><strong>The benefits</strong></h1><br /><ul><br /><li>Pay &pound;55,000-65,000</li><br /><li>Stock options</li><br /><li>Flexible hours</li><br /><li>Working from home when you want</li><br /><li>25 days holiday</li><br /><li>Pick your own hardware up to &pound;2000</li><br /><li>Training budget</li><br /><li>Central London office</li><br /></ul>",

We encourage you to explain your approach, be collaborative and ask questions. The goal of taking you through different parts of the stack is to confirm your areas of strength and passion. We also like to see fluency with your chosen tools. &nbsp;It’s totally expected for you to use search engines while you’re problem-solving, we just ask that you’re mindful of how much you’re relying on them. &nbsp;You'll be working through the exercises on your own machine, using the tools of your choice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Code day with one of our development hiring teams&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* Our code day is meant to be a day in the life of our Software Developer role. &nbsp;You’ll join us for the day, work with our team and build an application. &nbsp;You’ll simulate a mini sprint by planning a project with a Software Developer, Database Administrator, Product Manager and Engineering Manager. &nbsp;You’ll have a combination of individual work time and pair programming with a Software Developer. &nbsp;At the end of the day, you’ll demo your application and dig into the code. &nbsp;You’ll have tons of opportunities to ask us questions and really learn what it’d be like to work at CoverMyMeds. &nbsp;We’re happy to conduct this step virtually for our remote candidates to get a good sense for how a remote Software Developer role would feel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA quick note: If you’d prefer different logistics to accommodate your individual needs and set you up for success, let us know how we can help. &nbsp;We want this process to be accessible and inclusive for you.  </div> </div>",

Help us build the future of precision forestry. Our clients include NGOs, state and national governmental agencies, and several of the largest forest landowners in the world.\\n\\nOur work has been featured in [The Wall Street Journal,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ai-might-be-used-to-battle-wildfires-11554168366) [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90269483/how-ai-software-could-help-fight-future-wildfires), and the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190226-how-to-bring-wildfires-back-under-control). Through our collaboration with Microsoft as an AI for Earth grantee we’ve been able to create the first ever high resolution nationwide forest inventory, with data for every acre in America. Looking forward, we believe that recent advancements in remote sensing, cloud computing, and AI - combined with deep domain expertise - puts us in a unique position to build the future of forestry. If we ship even half of the things we have planned for 2020, it will be a wild year and we can’t do it without you.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n In this role, you’ll work closely with project managers to help design the next generation of forestry software. We’re a small team, so you’ll be contributing at all levels of the process - from initial UI/UX sketches to phone calls with users in the field about their experience with the new feature.\\n\\nSilviaTerra is a fully remote company, working loosely US hours. Some travel will be required to company meetings (3-4 weeks per year).\\n \\n\\n# Requirements\\nA successful candidate will have the following:\\n\\n* Experience with Python, Docker, and Linux based development\\n* Front end experience - can design product UI/UX. HTML/CSS/Javascript. Has googled “how to vertically center a div” before at least a few times (and knows they will have to again!)\\n* Ability to manage their own work remotely\\n* A highly organized, communicative and collaborative work style\\n\\nWe'd be extra excited if you have:\\n\\n* Experience with React/Redux, Django\\n* Experience building mobile applications\\n* Dev Ops experience. Digital Ocean/AWS/Azure, CI/CD.\\n* General interest in forestry. For this position, we won’t need you to be able to distinguish between a Pine and Spruce (hint: it’s the needles!). We have a separate Biometrics Team for that. However, we hope you can get excited about nature or, at the very least, a good game of Photosynthesis the Board Game. \\n\\n#Location\\n- US-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world and provide skills that will enhance our business intelligence system to help us make better decisions.\\n\\nWe’ll teach you the ins and outs of the online business brokerage industry, coming from years of experience. You’ll work on improving the customer journey, which should be flawless, pain free and easy to navigate. For many of our customers it is the first time either buying or selling an online business, which can be an incredibly anxious and confusing moment in their lives. You’ll be helping them directly by providing them with an easy to use interface that just makes sense.\\nThe Senior Full Stack Engineer position is vital to the success of our company, partnering with all departments to align technology strategy with the company’s objectives.\\n\\nOur small and close knit engineering team currently consists of a UX specialist, 2 frontend engineers, one backend engineer, one WordPress engineer and several QA specialists. You’ll work closely with the team to implement solutions for all departments within Empire Flippers, be it compliance, customer support, sales and migrations. Additional responsibilities could lead to supervising our engineering team.\\n\\nThis is a full time position – our company is growing at a fast rate, which means excellent opportunities for personal and career growth. We may ask you to attend conferences too, which can help you network with industry leaders.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n You’ll take on the challenge of improving the overall efficiency of Empire Flippers by developing fully fledged platforms, ensuring both the user experience and functionality are elevated to unprecedented levels. You’ll be responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment building high quality, architecturally sound systems. You will use your initiative to design and implement client-side and server-side architecture, as well as implement API’s and integrations that address our business needs. Both our clients and staff will be using the software you write and you’ll be responsible for monitoring system performance and configuring new software and hardware. \\n\\n# Requirements\\nYou must have a passion for travel, ideally with long periods of digital nomad experience with travel outside your home country.\\n\\nYou should have at least 5 good years of full stack experience under your belt, having implemented some complex, data driven applications. Your portfolio speaks louder than your words.\\n\\nYou should have team-lead or management experience with a remote team.\\n\\nAn in-depth understanding of database management systems, both relational and non-relational databases.\\n\\nHands on experience in IT, computer systems engineering, or systems engineering and analysis is necessary.\\n\\nYou should have an ability to conduct technological analyses and research, with a solid understanding of technological trends to build strategy.\\n\\nYou should be a ninja with every component of our tech stack. You must have a complete working knowledge of Ruby on Rails, SQL, Postgres, Sidekiq, Rspec, Git, Redis.\\n\\nExperience working with a wide range of 3rd party integrations. Our platform talks to many 3rd party applications, you should have experience building and maintaining such integrations in a test driven fashion.\\n\\nDev-ops/sysadmin skills, particularly AWS. Experience with managing servers, maintaining hosting environments, being responsible for uptime and responsiveness, addressing bottlenecks, ensuring backups are kept safe and sound.\\n\\nYou need to have immaculate attention to detail. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if something doesn’t quite look or feel right, to the nearest code change and to the nearest hexadecimal color, to the point you become annoying to us. At times other developers may edit your code, you’ll be watching to ensure the code base remains readable, scalable and fast.\\n\\nBe a good communicator. It sounds very cliché, but you’ll immerse yourself in almost every department, you’ll be learning problems and presenting solutions, and also overseeing the implementation of those solutions too.\\n\\nA self-starter. We need to see some evidence that you’re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you’ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won’t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day to day basis, you’ll be working in almost full autonomy, we’ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. We don’t believe in micro-management.\\n\\nA complete working knowledge in React. Our client code is written in React. Being able to navigate the front-end code and patch things up is needed.\\n\\nThe following skills/experience would be a bonus, but not required:\\n\\nPHP/WordPress. We will be interfacing with WordPress significantly, being able to speak the same language would be great.\\n\\nDatabases. A comprehensive experience working with various types of SQL and noSQL databases would be very useful. MySQL, Postgres, DynamoDB, Cassandra, to name a few.\\n\\nCaching. The software we’re building needs to be fast and to remain fast as we scale, both in terms of traffic and database size. Having experience with Memcached, Varnish or experience with complicated CDN setups with many rules would be a plus. \\n\\n#Salary\\n$120,000\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

We are building the data exchange platform, backed by a network of hundreds of health systems and thousands of app developers, that provides consistent, easy access to the developers building the next generation of healthcare technology.</p><p>By eliminating access to healthcare data as a barrier to entry, we are enabling the technical innovation that will allow healthcare providers to better care for patients and for patients to better control their health.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Transparent Communication- Regular All Team Meetings</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work - work anywhere in the US!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Open Source languages</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Open PTO - Flexible time off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance Day 1</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k Day 1</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Parental Leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Productivity Stipend</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.</p><p>We are a socially conscious, distributed team. We give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living where you’re most comfortable and working in areas where you can help foster and grow the community that you are a part of.</p><p>We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth. As one of our first front-end developers, your decisions will have an outsized influence on the future of our product.&nbsp;You’ll take input from product, design, and customers and then you’ll collaborate with other experienced, passionate engineering team to build the frameworks and features that will support our customers now, and in the future.</p><p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong></p><ul><li>Collaborative. You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together.</li><li>Customer focused. User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if the customers don't enjoy using it.</li><li>Disciplined and reliable. We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.</li><li>Appreciative of honest feedback. You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</li><li>Work smarter and harder. You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.</li><li>Analytical and practical mind. You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.</li></ul><p><strong>Front-End at Crisp&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Statically typed, modern languages. We use TypeScript and React for the UI, and GraphQL with Apollo to communicate with our backend.&nbsp;Knowledge of these specific technologies is not a requirement. If you’re willing to learn, we’re willing to help you along the way.</li><li>Continuous deployment. Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</li><li>Micro-services. Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.</li><li>Start-up mode.&nbsp;The team is still small, and the product is fresh.&nbsp;You’ll be able to exert a large amount of influence, and contribute to decisions that will determine the future of the product and the team.</li></ul><p>We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products.

Das Tool soll&nbsp;Maschinenbauern erstmalig einen Modulbaukasten an die Hand geben, der Usability- und Designregeln automatisch befolgt, Spaß macht und ein ausgereiftes HTML5 HMI generiert, ohne dass auf Kundenseite tiefe Fachexpertise notwendig ist.&nbsp;Wenn Du Teil einer&nbsp;innovativen Produktentwicklung rund um das Thema intelligente&nbsp;Maschineninterfaces&nbsp;werden möchtest, dann bist Du bei uns richtig.</p><p>Als Frontend-Entwickler konzipierst Du Teile der Webanwendungen mit JavaScript, Typescript, HTML und CSS und setzt UI-Designs um. Du bist stark in der technischen Konzeption und im API-Design und&nbsp;implementierst zusammen mit dem Team&nbsp;neue Features.&nbsp;</p><p>Da wir ein kleines Team sind, legen wir viel Wert auf eigenverantwortliches und zuverlässiges Arbeiten. Wann und wo Du Deine Arbeit am besten erledigen kannst, weißt Du selbst am besten. Deine Arbeitszeiten und ob Du im Büro oder Remote arbeiten möchtest, kannst Du daher selbst festlegen. Über Slack, Github, u.a.&nbsp;können wir trotzdem jederzeit Ideen und Fragen austauschen.</p><p>Da unsere Software einer technisch anspruchsvollen Branche&nbsp;dient, sind uns gute Lösungen wichtiger als schnelle. Wir nehmen uns daher immer die Zeit, unsere Entwicklung gut zu planen und unsere Ergebnisse mit Tests und Performance-Tools zu prüfen.&nbsp;</p><p>Entwicklerkonferenzen&nbsp;gehören für uns jedes Jahr fest zum Programm um mit anderen Entwicklern im Gespräch zu bleiben und einen Blick über den eigenen Tellerrand zu werfen. Als Entwickler experimentieren wir liebend gerne mit neuen Technologien und überlegen, was sich sinnhaft in unser Produkt&nbsp;integrieren lässt. Die Abstraktion individueller Kundenanforderungen und&nbsp;Maschinentypen in generische und zeitgemäße Toolbausteine ist eine anspruchsvolle Aufgabe und die Arbeit an&nbsp;unserem&nbsp;stetig wachsenden Produkt wird garantiert nie langweilig.</p><p><strong>Was wir suchen:</strong></p><ul><li>Sehr gute Kenntnisse von React, TypeScript, HTML und CSS</li><li>Gutes Gespür für grafische Details</li><li>Erfahrung mit Git</li><li>Stark in der technischen Konzeption</li><li>Entwickler mit Wohnort in D/A/CH und guten Deutschkenntissen</li></ul><p><strong>Worüber wir uns freuen – oder was du gerne bei uns lernen würdest:</strong></p><ul><li>Erfahrung in Backend-Entwicklung mit Node.js</li><li>Erfahrung GraphQL und&nbsp;Sketch</li><li>Erfahrung in der Produktentwicklung</li></ul><p><strong>Unser Bewerbungsprozess:</strong></p><ul><li>Bewerbung mit Deinem Portfolio</li><li>Telefoninterview mit&nbsp;technischer Leitung</li><li>Persönliches Gespräch mit Geschäftsleitung und Kollegen bei uns im Büro</li><li>Anschließend Rückmeldung und Angebot innerhalb von 2 Wochen</li></ul><p><em>Wir freuen uns auch, wenn Du anderweitige Programmierkenntnisse hast und uns davon etwas zeigen willst.&nbsp;</em><em>Wir möchten Deine Fähigkeiten und Motivation nicht nur anhand von Zeugnissen beurteilen.

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone’s day, you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p><p>At NearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.</p><p><strong>Our company</strong>:</p><p>Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.</p><p><br>More information:<a href='https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/' rel='nofollow'> https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/</a></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/287824?reset=False&amp;ra=1ywGIJdBrCCs&amp;oqs=a%3D1ywGIJdBrCCs%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>International environment with distinctive colleagues</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Feedback culture to help everyone grow</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly learning seminars</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly company trip</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Several trips to our HQ in Copenhagen per year</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Budget for conferences</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Have an impact on the industry that powers global trade</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Our developers work from home and co-working spaces and sometimes even on the beach!&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>competitive compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>amazing start-up projects</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>inclusive cultural environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>technical mentorship</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>non-intrusive work environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Agile processes set-up</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>community involvement</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We need a senior developer and we&rsquo;ve made a video for the role <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXMR9RmDG7c&amp;feature=youtu.be'>here</a>. <br /><br /></p><br /><p>The concept of the app is to give people video calls with a lawyer at the press of a button, to deal with their problems like employment, matrimonial, tax and property. Most people have never used a lawyer (other than perhaps for conveyancing) and we want to change that. It is similar to the Babylon health app but for lawyers instead of doctors.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>This is a fantastic opportunity to make a difference and work with a dynamic and forward thinking startup team. We encourage teamwork and open discussion, especially for problem solving, and we have a real passion for bringing the provision of legal services up to date using tech. In fact, Monaco Solicitors was recently shortlisted in the Law Society Excellence Awards for innovation in technology.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>The product team currently consists of 1 front end dev and 2 designers plus a product owner. To give you a little sneak peek of what you will be building, our app will feature the following:</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Account creation (both Lawyers and clients)</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Lawyer and user profiles</li><br /><li>Calendar booking system with availability</li><br /><li>Cloud stored documents/paperwork</li><br /><li>Provision of advice from Lawyer in paid sessions, including video call</li><br /><li>Payment gateway</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Skills Required</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Building React &amp; React Native apps&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Building PWA (progressive web apps)</li><br /><li>Javascript, ES6+</li><br /><li>NodeJs (AWS lambda / serverless)</li><br /><li>Minimum 6-8 years of Experience in creating Web &amp; Apps solutions</li><br /><li>IT infrastructure and cloud development</li><br /><li>Software architecture design</li><br /><li>DevOps</li><br /><li>Project and product management</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Coding (minimum 50% of the role)</li><br /><li>Analysing requirements and coming up with appropriate solutions</li><br /><li>Setting up the workflow for devs&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Guiding and participating in stack selection</li><br /><li>Project management, agile / scrum&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Nice to have</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>AWS ecosystem experience</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Competitive salary</li><br /><li>Pension scheme</li><br /><li>Opportunity to work from home&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Unique office space (converted multi-storey car park in Peckham</li><br /></ul>",

    "content": "<div><br /><h2>The role</h2><br /><div class=&quot;article_rich_text w-richtext&quot;><br /><p>We are looking for a talented senior engineer to join our small-but-growing company at an exciting time for the tech team.</p><br /><p>Started in 2012, CV Partner was initially built by the founder using all the coolest technology for that time: Rails, CoffeeScript and Mongo. A couple of years later a React frontend was added and this stack enabled us to remain agile while we discovered our clients' needs and quickly build the functionality they were seeking. We ended up creating a tool that they enjoy using and has a measurable improvement in their productivity and ability to win bids.</p><br /><p>Now, 7 years on, with a bigger team, many features added, larger clients signed and much more data being processed we're finding the limitations of the current architecture. Some tech debt has accumulated and it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult to keep the ever-expanding Rails app up to date with the latest versions and add new features in a timely manner. Also, we're slightly embarrassed to still be using CoffeeScript in 2019.</p><br /><p>So, we've started to put in place some infrastructure that will help us transition to building microservices. We've begun work on an event-source based architecture with plans to utilise the CQRS pattern. We&rsquo;ve already built some of the main building blocks in Rust and are starting to flesh out how some of the trickier aspects will work (e.g. auth, shared frontend components etc).</p><br /><p>The team is currently comprised of all senior-level people, including two software engineers, a DevOps and a UX designer. The founder also still codes occasionally as we haven't built up the courage to revoke his git access yet.</p><br /><p>You'll help put in place the foundations of the technology and engineering practices that can provide a platform for the company to meet the needs of our clients over the coming years. That means deciding on programming languages, tools and services to help build robust, fast and secure software. We're looking at things such as TypeScript, Vue and GraphQL/AppSync but nothing is set in stone and we value using the best tool for the job.</p><br /><p>The next phase of growth will be to start bringing mid-level or junior engineers into the team, so you should be happy mentoring those with less experience and when the time comes, we'd value your input into the hiring process.</p><br /><p>We're pretty laid-back when it comes to flexible working so you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to spend some time working from home or a co-working space close to home if you have a long commute.

First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work.

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone’s day, you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p><p>At NearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

Gathering around the dinner table, eating with those you care about and enjoying a nutritious meal is paramount to our mission. Therefore, we create software to further empower individuals to bring back family dinner time without sacrificing the little spare time they have available—giving our users time for what matters most.</p><p>OAMM began as a blog in 2009 with a deep, rich, invested community. Over the last six years it has emerged as a SaaS product fueled by the passions and membership of the community. The technology side of our product is exciting and challenging to build but unlike many other SaaS products, it isn’t the technology that drives the product. The driving force is our community/membership. We believe strongly that these two things, technology and community, have to be in balance and we are looking for a software developer that can respect, appreciate and aspire to help us grow both. OAMM is also committed to steady growth through self-funding as we evolve our product.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>Once A Month Meals is looking to add to its technology team an experienced Lead Ruby Software Developer. As part of the OAMM technology team, you’ll work with freezer cooking, “cooking math,” user accounts, ecommerce, and more. You’ll need to be comfortable with databases like MySQL and Postgres, and either understand (or be able to come up to speed quickly on) Solr. Experience designing, building, and supporting REST APIs with authentication is important, because we leverage a number of third party APIs for crucial aspects of our systems.</p><p>It will be important to have the experience and ability to do some long-term, big-picture architecture thinking but have the skills and desire enough to implement this architecture through solid, tested code.&nbsp;</p><p>Your coding abilities are just one piece of the puzzle though. In addition to being able to write great code, this position requires a unique skill set. The following are vital to the success of this position:</p><ol><li><strong>Ruby on Rails Depth of Knowledge</strong> - It isn’t enough to simply have used Ruby here and there, a deep understanding and application of it in your previous work is essential.</li><li><strong>Experience in the Kitchen</strong> - it doesn’t have to be freezer or batch cooking, although experience with those is a plus. Experience in the kitchen cooking, preparing recipes and/or meal planning is important to the role and to understanding the software’s main functions.</li><li><strong>A Love for Math</strong> - fractions, ceilings, scaling recipes and mathematical algorithms are a regular part of coding life in this role. If you told your high school math teacher you would never use algebra again, this probably isn’t the role for you. :)</li><li><strong>Organizational Leadership</strong> - the ability to be self directed, write scopes, document processes and communicate those to a team is imperative. This is a small team (front end developer, project manager and yourself) right now, which means that there is an expectation that you will be able to lead yourself and eventually others. Strong communication and decision making within the context of the greater team mission is important.</li><li><strong>Experience Working on a LIVE Product</strong> - proven experience designing, planning, and building web applications to scale is imperative. There are thousands of active users on this system requiring that the code needs to be incrementally built, tested and released to ensure zero disruptions to the user experience.</li></ol><p><em>Your job duties will include:</em></p><ul><li>Maintaining two Rails apps</li><ul><li>Keeping the Ruby gems updated on staging and production environments</li></ul><li>Watching and improving performance (speed and analytics) of APIs</li><li>Build, maintain and test new features</li><li>Develop automated, incremental, deployments and tests</li><li>Assistance in setting technical direction for the OAMM products</li></ul><p><strong>Skills/Tools/Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Ruby</li><li>Rails</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Postgres</li><li>Git</li><li>Automated deployments (Capistrano, etc.)</li><li>Stripe API</li></ul><p>Because we are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, we all play multiple roles. As we grow, we want to continue to build a product design and development team. This position will be a key-player on that team with opportunity to impact the technical architecture and the future development team.</p><p><strong>The ideal candidate is:</strong></p><ul><li>a self-starter—they seek out opportunities to learn new methods or technologies</li><li>a problem-solver—they figure out how to get things done</li><li>comfortable with task runners like gulp and grunt</li><li>competent with git and github</li><li>mindful of performance and interested in implementing tools like performance budgets</li><li>unashamed in their support of accessibility best practices as well as progressive enhancement and responsive design</li><li>able to communicate effectively in writing and in-person</li><li>willing to balance all constraints of a problem: user needs, timeline, budget, product vision</li><li>A meal planner - they see the benefits and are willing to plan meals for themselves on a regular basis</li><li>collaborative—nothing gets done in a vacuum around here, we need folks who recognize they’ll be better if they work <em>with</em> others</li></ul><p><strong>Experience with deeper software development best-practices (or strong desire to grow into them) is a plus:</strong></p><ul><li>work with other members of the product team to build modular, maintainable and reusable code</li><li>work with internal and external resources to implement fixes and features to the stack currently in place (WordPress, Sass, Rails)</li><li>recommend and implement best-practices around developer productivity, source-control, automated testing, API design, security, performance and share our learnings with the greater tech community</li></ul><p><strong>Additional experience in the following strongly desired:</strong></p><ul><li>Javascript frameworks such as React, Ember, or Angular, or Vue</li><li>Solr</li><li>CircleCI</li><li>Docker</li><li>PHP</li></ul><p><strong>The Culture</strong></p><p>OAMM strives to create an environment where individuals are encouraged to work independently but enabled to work collaboratively. We spend a lot of time on Slack and in video calls interacting daily. We also get together in person at least twice a year for a retreat, usually to a warm climate.  We value spending time with one another when we are at work, and caring for each person, while recognizing and encouraging a work-life family balance.</p><p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive Salary</li><li>Personal Days: Two weeks (plus one week holiday shutdown and minimal standard US holidays due to peak sales periods matching those holidays—so we try to make up for it during the year)</li><li>Flexible Schedule: Work when you want, just provide us with some Eastern Time Zone overlap for meetings</li><li>All the hardware and software needed to do your job</li><li>Opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of families</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/294499?reset=False&amp;ra=1ALtQVkF1YjK&amp;oqs=a%3D1ALtQVkF1YjK%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About Once A Month Meals</h4>            <div><p>We are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, so&nbsp;most of us&nbsp;play multiple roles. The product team includes 3 of our 11 staff members. When fully staffed, we have a full-time front-end developer, a full-time back end developer (that's the position we are hiring now) and a full-time project manager who also serves as a data analyst and QA Tester. Given the small nature of the team you will be both leading and writing code.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology team serves the larger organization in a vital way.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p><p>Our Client Team is now on the lookout for a Senior Frontend Engineer focused on UX and UI who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>The Client Domain is all about innovation. Here we shape our products to satisfy the needs of our heterogeneous customer base. To achieve this you will collaborate closely with the Backend Engineers of the Client Services Team to design the most optimal APIs to be used in our client applications.</p><p>As part of this team, you will play a key role in the development of our web and mobile applications for both, end users (i.e. players) and internal users (i.e. back office users). Building these from the ground up offers a great opportunity for you to take important decisions with regards to our architecture and workflows.</p><p>You will be tasked to find the right technology to solve the challenges we face, take responsibility for the implementation, and share your knowledge with your peers.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>The base compensation range for this role is €50k-70k annually, depending on your background and experience. It can be subject to an adjustment of up to 15% in either direction if the cost-of-living in your region is far above or below the European average. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li><p>5+ years experience in developing complex web and mobile applications with JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Experience with CSS3 animations and transitions</p></li><li><p>Solid experience with at least one main frontend framework</p></li><li><p>Good knowledge of HTML and CSS standards</p></li><li><p>Good eye for detail and sense of composition</p></li><li><p>Passion for UX and understanding of web accessibility principles</p></li><li><p>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</p></li><li><p>Interest in taking full ownership of your applications and managing them in a production environment including the troubleshooting of live incidents</p></li><li><p>Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build</p></li><li><p>Highly process driven and eager to learn</p></li><li><p>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</p></li><li><p>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</p></li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/senior-frontend-engineer-uxui/c/new?source=Stack%20Overflow&amp;utm_source=stack_overflow&amp;utm_medium=job&amp;utm_campaign=client_elixir_senior' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 72 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p><p>While we’ve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p><p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p><ul><li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li><li>Working on interesting technical problems that haven’t been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li><li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li><li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li><li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li></ul><p>…you should reach out.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Any computer / tech you want</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers.

We're building a digital assistant that takes care of the financial paperwork for entrepreneurs, saving them time, money and a lot of frustration and worries.</p><p>In the past months we&nbsp;worked hard on the business case, the design, finding funds and building a prototype (in Vue.js). Now it's time to bring her to life! And therefore we need you: a talented full stack developer that wants to join us on our journey.</p><p>As we are building our product from scratch, you have the unique opportunity to be part of the team, right from the very first lines of code. We offer you a&nbsp;playground where you can put all your passion in building a piece of software to be proud of. Software that is scalable and maintainable and can easily grow along with our customer base and the size of our team. Software that is secure and protects the data of our clients.</p><p>We expect you to be our technical guru. The go-to person that follows the latest trends in web and mobile development, juggles with .NET, Azure, React (Native), Apollo and GraphQL. The one that leads the way and coaches his fellow developers but learns from them at the same time. We’re too small for “overhead”, so we’re not looking for a manager but rather a passionate developer with strong analytical, engineering and people skills.</p><p><strong>Your job</strong></p><ul><li>You’re responsible for the software architecture and the quality of our code</li><li>You “lead by example” as one of the most driven and structured developers of the team</li><li>You coach your fellow developers when needed</li><li>You introduce best practices for coding and conduct regular code reviews.</li><li>You believe in our product and take up and active role in shaping its roadmap</li><li>You defined the test strategy &amp; make sure quality is monitored with automated tests&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Required Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Designing &amp; developing back-ends in the Microsoft technology stack ( C#, .NET, .NET Core, .NET, SQL Server)</li><li>Web/native app development with ASP.NET Core, React/Apollo &amp; HTML5/CSS</li><li>Api development with GraphQL</li><li>Designing&nbsp;scalable and secure&nbsp;architectures in Azure</li><li>Notions of mobile app development with Object C/Swift and&nbsp;Java/Kotlin</li><li>Strong communication skills</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/290221?reset=False&amp;ra=1zkwPIbSfLpK&amp;oqs=a%3D1zkwPIbSfLpK%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>a true “start-up” experience</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>a small team, lots of hard work, fun and impact</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>ownership &amp; responsibility to build with us the product we dream of</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We are a fully distributed team with people working all around the world. You will have the flexibility and freedom to work in the environment of your choosing, whether that be at home, a cafe or co-working space. We're looking for a senior engineer to help build our API-First core app using JavaScript/AngularJS/React and Scala/Play.</p><p>ABOUT YOU</p><p>You love code. You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).</p><p>You love great UX. You spend most of your time coding, but you also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, you care about more than just the code.</p><p>You love learning new things. You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Scala, CSS, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it.</p><p>You can balance lots of concerns. Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.</p><p>You love helping others. You love sharing knowledge with the rest of your team, building shared tooling for other engineers, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers.</p><p>WHAT YOU’LL DO</p><ul><li>Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to planning our migration to React, implementing Redux best practices, and transitioning code to TypeScript.</li><li>Build reusable React components, migrate AngularJS components to React, manage data on the client with Redux, and test everything with Jasmine.</li><li>Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or custom tooling.</li><li>Refactor or improve existing code. We're planning to migrate our frontend to React, but we still have a lot of AngularJS code to clean up. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code.</li><li>Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.</li><li>Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality.</li><li>Review code written by other team members or other teams.</li><li>Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.</li></ul><p>WHAT YOU’LL BRING</p><ul><li>5+ years of software development experience</li><li>Experience with building and maintaining a SaaS product at scale</li><li>An affinity for creating software that is extensible, performant, and easy to read</li><li>A degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://angel.co/company/process-street/jobs/558380-remote-senior-frontend-engineer-javascript-angularjs-react' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Process Street</h4>            <div><ul><li>Cameron McKay - CTO -&nbsp;<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdmckay' rel='nofollow'>https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdmckay</a></li><li>Alex Agulyansky - Engineering Team Lead&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexagulyansky/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexagulyansky</a></li></ul>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Interesting Product</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large user base where you can see features in action</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Profitable and stable company</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Experienced Team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Organized processes</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Clear roadmap strategy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>API First</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

The project is based at the University of Oslo where we operate as an independent software development organisation. As a software engineer you will be an employee of the University of Oslo, with the government pension plan and benefits which&nbsp;come with it.</p><p>With us you get a chance to work on stuff which really matters: Improving the health and well-being of people in developing countries through access and use of information. Our platform is used in more than 60 countries worldwide and has the scale and adoption which will allow you to make an impact globally.</p><p>We give you a lot of flexibility and freedom and there is no micro-management or strict hierarchies. At&nbsp;DHIS 2 we believe you will do your best work if you fully understand the context which the system operates in. As a result you are&nbsp;encouraged to engage directly with our projects, take part in the design process and get feedback from users in the field. If you like travelling there will be opportunities to go to other continents and be part of requirement meetings and workshops.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>5 weeks of holiday</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>The best tools - workstations, tablets, phones</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Generous parental leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great retirement savings contributions</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Modern offices with central location</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

In a retail store, we&rsquo;ll be able to easily find out additional product information and about related products, just like we can online. In an airport or shopping mall, we&rsquo;ll have clear wayfinding and suggestions, specific to our needs.</p><br /><p>This is a shift that will occur with the introduction of wearable AR technology. Eventually, it&rsquo;ll be expected that every major retail space will have these types of integrations. They&rsquo;ll become &ldquo;hyper-spaces&rdquo;, able to eliminate typical friction points, and enhance your experience of being there.</p><br /><p>This is the future that Dent Reality wants to build.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re currently an early-stage startup, developing a platform which integrates into retail stores, airports and shopping malls &ndash; using technologies such as AR and AI to help people find the stores and products they&rsquo;re looking for.</p><br /><p>Our accomplished product team has developed some of the most highly-regarded work in this area, including our Retail AR demo, which demonstrates our vision for the future of retail: https://twitter.com/AndrewProjDent/status/981635577488519170</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;ve already generated enormous interest from a wide range of organisations, have secured our first paying customers, and are now seeking a high performing web developer to help us scale.</p><br /><p>--</p><br /><p><strong>About The Role&nbsp;</strong></p><br /><p>We build everything product-first, with an obsessive focus on user experience. We believe that the best products come from enabling a team of people to work openly and contribute ideas cross-speciality, fully realising their individual potential.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll initially be responsible for building an interactive front-end mapping tool, enabling customers to build indoor maps, view analytics, and make payments. In your application, say &ldquo;Rocket&rdquo; so we know you&rsquo;ve read this.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be given ownership and freedom over development, and will be responsible for making key technology, infrastructure and product decisions. You&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to lead the web team as it grows.</p><br /><p>Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking for:<br />- 3+ years of Full-Stack experience<br />- Good understanding of software architecture<br />- Good understanding of front-end frameworks such as React JS and Vue JS<br />- Experience with building back-end tools. We&rsquo;re not looking for any particular language use what you&rsquo;re most comfortable with!<br />- Experience with managing cloud computing platforms such as AWS<br />- Experience with integrating external services, such as Stripe</p><br /><p>Nice to have:<br />- Experience with mapping libraries such as Leaflet JS and OpenLayers&nbsp;<br />- Experience with building interactive front-end interfaces</p><br /><p>Dent Reality is based in London. We&rsquo;re open to remote work, so long as there&rsquo;s good overlap in working hours.</p>",

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone’s day, you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p><p>At NearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

Gathering around the dinner table, eating with those you care about and enjoying a nutritious meal is paramount to our mission. Therefore, we create software to further empower individuals to bring back family dinner time without sacrificing the little spare time they have available—giving our users time for what matters most.</p><p>OAMM began as a blog in 2009 with a deep, rich, invested community. Over the last six years it has emerged as a SaaS product fueled by the passions and membership of the community. The technology side of our product is exciting and challenging to build but unlike many other SaaS products, it isn’t the technology that drives the product. The driving force is our community/membership. We believe strongly that these two things, technology and community, have to be in balance and we are looking for a software developer that can respect, appreciate and aspire to help us grow both. OAMM is also committed to steady growth through self-funding as we evolve our product.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>Once A Month Meals is looking to add to its technology team an experienced Lead Ruby Software Developer. As part of the OAMM technology team, you’ll work with freezer cooking, “cooking math,” user accounts, ecommerce, and more. You’ll need to be comfortable with databases like MySQL and Postgres, and either understand (or be able to come up to speed quickly on) Solr. Experience designing, building, and supporting REST APIs with authentication is important, because we leverage a number of third party APIs for crucial aspects of our systems.</p><p>It will be important to have the experience and ability to do some long-term, big-picture architecture thinking but have the skills and desire enough to implement this architecture through solid, tested code.&nbsp;</p><p>Your coding abilities are just one piece of the puzzle though. In addition to being able to write great code, this position requires a unique skill set. The following are vital to the success of this position:</p><ol><li><strong>Ruby on Rails Depth of Knowledge</strong> - It isn’t enough to simply have used Ruby here and there, a deep understanding and application of it in your previous work is essential.</li><li><strong>Experience in the Kitchen</strong> - it doesn’t have to be freezer or batch cooking, although experience with those is a plus. Experience in the kitchen cooking, preparing recipes and/or meal planning is important to the role and to understanding the software’s main functions.</li><li><strong>A Love for Math</strong> - fractions, ceilings, scaling recipes and mathematical algorithms are a regular part of coding life in this role. If you told your high school math teacher you would never use algebra again, this probably isn’t the role for you. :)</li><li><strong>Organizational Leadership</strong> - the ability to be self directed, write scopes, document processes and communicate those to a team is imperative. This is a small team (front end developer, project manager and yourself) right now, which means that there is an expectation that you will be able to lead yourself and eventually others. Strong communication and decision making within the context of the greater team mission is important.</li><li><strong>Experience Working on a LIVE Product</strong> - proven experience designing, planning, and building web applications to scale is imperative. There are thousands of active users on this system requiring that the code needs to be incrementally built, tested and released to ensure zero disruptions to the user experience.</li></ol><p><em>Your job duties will include:</em></p><ul><li>Maintaining two Rails apps</li><ul><li>Keeping the Ruby gems updated on staging and production environments</li></ul><li>Watching and improving performance (speed and analytics) of APIs</li><li>Build, maintain and test new features</li><li>Develop automated, incremental, deployments and tests</li><li>Assistance in setting technical direction for the OAMM products</li></ul><p><strong>Skills/Tools/Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Ruby</li><li>Rails</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Postgres</li><li>Git</li><li>Automated deployments (Capistrano, etc.)</li><li>Stripe API</li></ul><p>Because we are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, we all play multiple roles. As we grow, we want to continue to build a product design and development team. This position will be a key-player on that team with opportunity to impact the technical architecture and the future development team.</p><p><strong>The ideal candidate is:</strong></p><ul><li>a self-starter—they seek out opportunities to learn new methods or technologies</li><li>a problem-solver—they figure out how to get things done</li><li>comfortable with task runners like gulp and grunt</li><li>competent with git and github</li><li>mindful of performance and interested in implementing tools like performance budgets</li><li>unashamed in their support of accessibility best practices as well as progressive enhancement and responsive design</li><li>able to communicate effectively in writing and in-person</li><li>willing to balance all constraints of a problem: user needs, timeline, budget, product vision</li><li>A meal planner - they see the benefits and are willing to plan meals for themselves on a regular basis</li><li>collaborative—nothing gets done in a vacuum around here, we need folks who recognize they’ll be better if they work <em>with</em> others</li></ul><p><strong>Experience with deeper software development best-practices (or strong desire to grow into them) is a plus:</strong></p><ul><li>work with other members of the product team to build modular, maintainable and reusable code</li><li>work with internal and external resources to implement fixes and features to the stack currently in place (WordPress, Sass, Rails)</li><li>recommend and implement best-practices around developer productivity, source-control, automated testing, API design, security, performance and share our learnings with the greater tech community</li></ul><p><strong>Additional experience in the following strongly desired:</strong></p><ul><li>Javascript frameworks such as React, Ember, or Angular, or Vue</li><li>Solr</li><li>CircleCI</li><li>Docker</li><li>PHP</li></ul><p><strong>The Culture</strong></p><p>OAMM strives to create an environment where individuals are encouraged to work independently but enabled to work collaboratively. We spend a lot of time on Slack and in video calls interacting daily. We also get together in person at least twice a year for a retreat, usually to a warm climate.  We value spending time with one another when we are at work, and caring for each person, while recognizing and encouraging a work-life family balance.</p><p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive Salary</li><li>Personal Days: Two weeks (plus one week holiday shutdown and minimal standard US holidays due to peak sales periods matching those holidays—so we try to make up for it during the year)</li><li>Flexible Schedule: Work when you want, just provide us with some Eastern Time Zone overlap for meetings</li><li>All the hardware and software needed to do your job</li><li>Opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of families</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/294499?reset=False&amp;ra=1ALtQVkF1YjK&amp;oqs=a%3D1ALtQVkF1YjK' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About Once A Month Meals</h4>            <div><p>We are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, so&nbsp;most of us&nbsp;play multiple roles. The product team includes 3 of our 11 staff members. When fully staffed, we have a full-time front-end developer, a full-time back end developer (that's the position we are hiring now) and a full-time project manager who also serves as a data analyst and QA Tester. Given the small nature of the team you will be both leading and writing code.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology team serves the larger organization in a vital way. The technology powers the membership manager system and the recipe/menu database.&nbsp;The rest of the team is working with the end user directly. We take it very seriously that the technology team is an integrated part of the bigger team.

Build a long-form sales page<br><br></strong>Our designer makes sales pages that are many thousands of words digestible and enticing to read. We need you to do their work justice.<br><br><strong>4. Creation of membership areas<br><br></strong>We have a favoured WordPress membership plugin, and with it to create a layout that houses courses with clear and simple navigation.<br><br>We look to provide clients’ customers the best learning environment possible.<br><br><strong>5. Checkout pages<br><br></strong>Making sure payments are taken (reliably), membership entitlements are correct, and segments are created in a newsletter platform for buyers.<br><br>You’re familiar with best practices for security and testing.<br><br><strong>*<br><br></strong>The position will start at 15–20 hours per week, and hours will grow readily from there – pay set at a fair, mutually agreed hourly rate. We aim to have somebody with us for the long haul.<br><br><strong>To apply…<br><br></strong>Please write back (<a href='mailto:developer@courseconcierge.com' rel='nofollow'>developer@courseconcierge.com</a>) with *one* example of a project you have coded, along with a brief pitch on why you think you’d be a great fit.<br><br>Do not send more than one link or your entry will be disqualified.<br><br>Also, please do not send a resume, CV or attachment of any kind. We don’t care where you went to college (or even that you went at all) – all that matters is whether you can do it.<br><br>We won’t be able to get back to everyone, but for those who stand out, we will send a list of interview questions in writing, then, for the few we like best, set up a brief call to discuss the opportunity.<br><br><strong>The deadline for submissions is September 15th</strong>, though those who apply sooner are at an advantage.<br><br>We’ll pick two candidates from interviews to begin a paid two-week trial (to assess on-the-job performance and cultural fit). One person will then be chosen for the ongoing role.<br><br>Thank you for reading. Best of luck, and we look forward to hearing from you,<br><br>Edward</div></div>",

Gathering around the dinner table, eating with those you care about and enjoying a nutritious meal is paramount to our mission. Therefore, we create software to further empower individuals to bring back family dinner time without sacrificing the little spare time they have available—giving our users time for what matters most.</p><p>OAMM began as a blog in 2009 with a deep, rich, invested community. Over the last six years it has emerged as a SaaS product fueled by the passions and membership of the community. The technology side of our product is exciting and challenging to build but unlike many other SaaS products, it isn’t the technology that drives the product. The driving force is our community/membership. We believe strongly that these two things, technology and community, have to be in balance and we are looking for a software developer that can respect, appreciate and aspire to help us grow both. OAMM is also committed to steady growth through self-funding as we evolve our product.</p><p><strong>The Position</strong></p><p>Once A Month Meals is looking to add to its technology team an experienced Lead Ruby Software Developer. As part of the OAMM technology team, you’ll work with freezer cooking, “cooking math,” user accounts, ecommerce, and more. You’ll need to be comfortable with databases like MySQL and Postgres, and either understand (or be able to come up to speed quickly on) Solr. Experience designing, building, and supporting REST APIs with authentication is important, because we leverage a number of third party APIs for crucial aspects of our systems.</p><p>It will be important to have the experience and ability to do some long-term, big-picture architecture thinking but have the skills and desire enough to implement this architecture through solid, tested code.&nbsp;</p><p>Your coding abilities are just one piece of the puzzle though. In addition to being able to write great code, this position requires a unique skill set. The following are vital to the success of this position:</p><ol><li><strong>Ruby on Rails Depth of Knowledge</strong> - It isn’t enough to simply have used Ruby here and there, a deep understanding and application of it in your previous work is essential.</li><li><strong>Experience in the Kitchen</strong> - it doesn’t have to be freezer or batch cooking, although experience with those is a plus. Experience in the kitchen cooking, preparing recipes and/or meal planning is important to the role and to understanding the software’s main functions.</li><li><strong>A Love for Math</strong> - fractions, ceilings, scaling recipes and mathematical algorithms are a regular part of coding life in this role. If you told your high school math teacher you would never use algebra again, this probably isn’t the role for you. :)</li><li><strong>Organizational Leadership</strong> - the ability to be self directed, write scopes, document processes and communicate those to a team is imperative. This is a small team (front end developer, project manager and yourself) right now, which means that there is an expectation that you will be able to lead yourself and eventually others. Strong communication and decision making within the context of the greater team mission is important.</li><li><strong>Experience Working on a LIVE Product</strong> - proven experience designing, planning, and building web applications to scale is imperative. There are thousands of active users on this system requiring that the code needs to be incrementally built, tested and released to ensure zero disruptions to the user experience.</li></ol><p><em>Your job duties will include:</em></p><ul><li>Maintaining two Rails apps</li><ul><li>Keeping the Ruby gems updated on staging and production environments</li></ul><li>Watching and improving performance (speed and analytics) of APIs</li><li>Build, maintain and test new features</li><li>Develop automated, incremental, deployments and tests</li><li>Assistance in setting technical direction for the OAMM products</li></ul><p><strong>Skills/Tools/Qualifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Ruby</li><li>Rails</li><li>MySQL</li><li>Postgres</li><li>Git</li><li>Automated deployments (Capistrano, etc.)</li><li>Stripe API</li></ul><p>Because we are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, we all play multiple roles. As we grow, we want to continue to build a product design and development team. This position will be a key-player on that team with opportunity to impact the technical architecture and the future development team.</p><p><strong>The ideal candidate is:</strong></p><ul><li>a self-starter—they seek out opportunities to learn new methods or technologies</li><li>a problem-solver—they figure out how to get things done</li><li>comfortable with task runners like gulp and grunt</li><li>competent with git and github</li><li>mindful of performance and interested in implementing tools like performance budgets</li><li>unashamed in their support of accessibility best practices as well as progressive enhancement and responsive design</li><li>able to communicate effectively in writing and in-person</li><li>willing to balance all constraints of a problem: user needs, timeline, budget, product vision</li><li>A meal planner - they see the benefits and are willing to plan meals for themselves on a regular basis</li><li>collaborative—nothing gets done in a vacuum around here, we need folks who recognize they’ll be better if they work <em>with</em> others</li></ul><p><strong>Experience with deeper software development best-practices (or strong desire to grow into them) is a plus:</strong></p><ul><li>work with other members of the product team to build modular, maintainable and reusable code</li><li>work with internal and external resources to implement fixes and features to the stack currently in place (WordPress, Sass, Rails)</li><li>recommend and implement best-practices around developer productivity, source-control, automated testing, API design, security, performance and share our learnings with the greater tech community</li></ul><p><strong>Additional experience in the following strongly desired:</strong></p><ul><li>Javascript frameworks such as React, Ember, or Angular, or Vue</li><li>Solr</li><li>CircleCI</li><li>Docker</li><li>PHP</li></ul><p><strong>The Culture</strong></p><p>OAMM strives to create an environment where individuals are encouraged to work independently but enabled to work collaboratively. We spend a lot of time on Slack and in video calls interacting daily. We also get together in person at least twice a year for a retreat, usually to a warm climate.  We value spending time with one another when we are at work, and caring for each person, while recognizing and encouraging a work-life family balance.</p><p><strong>The Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Competitive Salary</li><li>Personal Days: Two weeks (plus one week holiday shutdown and minimal standard US holidays due to peak sales periods matching those holidays—so we try to make up for it during the year)</li><li>Flexible Schedule: Work when you want, just provide us with some Eastern Time Zone overlap for meetings</li><li>All the hardware and software needed to do your job</li><li>Opportunity to make a real difference in the lives of families</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/294499?reset=False&amp;ra=1ALtQVkF1YjK&amp;oqs=a%3D1ALtQVkF1YjK' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About Once A Month Meals</h4>            <div><p>We are a small (8 full-time and 3 part-time), fully-bootstrapped team, so&nbsp;most of us&nbsp;play multiple roles. The product team includes 3 of our 11 staff members. When fully staffed, we have a full-time front-end developer, a full-time back end developer (that's the position we are hiring now) and a full-time project manager who also serves as a data analyst and QA Tester. Given the small nature of the team you will be both leading and writing code.&nbsp;</p><p>The technology team serves the larger organization in a vital way. The technology powers the membership manager system and the recipe/menu database.&nbsp;The rest of the team is working with the end user directly. We take it very seriously that the technology team is an integrated part of the bigger team. They participate in staff meetings, retreats, conversations about features needed for the end-user and much more.&nbsp;To see more about our culture, values and mission check out -&nbsp;<a href='https://onceamonthmeals.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>https://onceamonthmeals.com/about/</a>.</p><p>Though small now, we want to continue to build a product design and development team as we build the membership base.&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Schedule: Work when you want with some EDT overlap.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Family-Friendly Work Environment w/true work/life balance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical/Dental Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Ample time off including a whole company shut down at the holidays.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>All the hardware and software needed to do your job</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We brought Docker to embedded GNU/Linux devices in 2013 and have been building our IoT toolkit ever since. We also maintain a variety of successful open source projects including&nbsp;<a href='https://etcher.io/' rel='nofollow'>Etcher</a>, <a href='https://www.balena.io/open' rel='nofollow'>openBalena</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/engine' rel='nofollow'>balenaEngine</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/os/' rel='nofollow'>balenaOS</a>, and made contributions to high-exposure projects such as&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/' rel='nofollow'>Docker</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://electronjs.org/' rel='nofollow'>Electron</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://appimage.org/' rel='nofollow'>AppImage</a>.</p><p>Our technology is open, standards-based, and proven in production across a wide range of scenarios from drones, 3D printers, point-of-sale devices, tidal turbines, skyscrapers and more. Our investors include DFJ, Aspect Ventures, GE, and Ericsson.</p><p>Balena&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href='https://resin.io/team/' rel='nofollow'>highly distributed, remote-friendly company</a>&nbsp;with a pretty much flat hierarchy. Our organization is adaptive, getting feedback signals from our users and systems. Right now we organize ourselves by projects, which allow us to build complex features and solve big problems, while staying mutable. As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Our primary focus has been to assist progressive organizations, particularly those influencing the policy and political landscape, that advocate on behalf of underserved communities. Our software platforms have been a vital part of keeping such organizations successful and efficient.</p><p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p><p>We are deeply committed to public service and progressive social change. We are 100% minority owned and operated with a diverse team, inclusive of gender, ethnicity, and race.</p><p><strong>Position Summary</strong></p><p>This role will focus on dev ops and back end/API development, but the ideal candidate will have a full stack skillset. Our stack is Postgres/Ruby/Rails/React. Right now we have a mix of HTML+jQuery and React but we are in the process of moving toward split app architecture. As part of that process we are building out a REST API and revamping our deployment environment. The latter would be the main focus of this position, but it would also involve pitching in on the React side of things when required.</p><p>We are seeking someone with excellent communication skills who will work as a team player and a self-starter. The ideal candidate should have mid-level experience, but they won’t be placed in some hierarchical structure. This position will work directly with the other developers, and will report directly to the CEO. The individual should be highly motivated to make a difference and to have an impact on moving progressive issues forward. Our employees’ opinions matter to us for the success of the company, and we want you to bring creative solutions to make our work better for our clients. Interest and understanding of politics and campaigns is a plus but not required.</p><p>Our employees are from all over the country, and bring varying levels of experience to the company. First and foremost, we value honesty from all employees within our firm. We strongly encourage a work environment centered on open communication and conscientiousness. Working remotely gives our employees the ability to better maintain a work-life balance, but we expect that productivity and job performance will not be sacrificed.</p><p>We are a fully remote team so you will need to be flexible to work with staff in different time zones when necessary.</p><p><br><br></p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Improve and maintain deployment environment and tools</li><li>Design and build efficient, reusable, and reliable Ruby code</li><li>Integration of data storage solutions Postgresql and Redis</li><li>Expand and improve test coverage</li><li>Identify bottlenecks and bugs then devise solutions to these problems</li><li>Help maintain code quality, organization, and automation</li><li>Integrations with external APIs</li></ul><p><strong>Skills</strong></p><ul><li>Experience setting up and maintaining deployment environments using Linux and Nginx</li><li>Knowledge of best practices and IT operations in an always-up, always-available service</li><li>Experience with automation/configuration management using either Puppet, Chef, or an equivalent</li><li>Ability to use a wide variety of open source technologies and cloud services</li><li>Strong experience with SQL and PostgreSQL</li><li>Advanced understanding of object-oriented programming</li><li>Experience with Ruby on Rails, along with common libraries such as Sidekiq</li><li>Intermediate understanding of the syntax of Ruby and its nuances</li><li>Intermediate understanding of Javascript and Jquery</li><li>Familiarity with front end frameworks such as Vue, React or Angular</li><li>Familiarity with concepts of MVC, ORM, and RESTful design patterns</li><li>A knack for writing clean, readable Ruby code</li><li>Ability to integrate multiple data sources and databases into one system</li><li>Understanding of fundamental design principles behind a scalable application</li><li>Able to create database schemas that represent and support business processes</li><li>Able to implement automated testing platforms and unit tests</li><li>Proficient understanding of code versioning tools such as Git</li><li>Familiarity with development aiding tools such as Bower, Bundler, Rake, etc.</li><li>Familiarity with continuous integration</li></ul><p>Compensation: Salary commensurate with knowledge, experience, and qualifications.</p><p>Politech is an Equal Opportunity Employer that greatly values diversity at our company.

From custom interactive microcontent, to immersive event microsites, you can build it with Ceros. Publish and update live content instantly, and embed it into your site instantly. Join us in ending the endless creation of static content and be part of the movement towards meaningful content experiences.\\n\\nWe are well-funded and venture-backed by prominent investors including Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.\\n\\nAbout the Product\\n\\nDesigning and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.\\n\\nOur codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.\\n\\nWe’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Docker, Jenkins, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.\\n\\nAbout the Team\\n\\nAs part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with.

We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15” Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).\\n\\nAs a Sr. Full Stack Developer, your typical day-to-day involves:\\n\\n\\n* writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying)\\n\\n* having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write\\n\\n* planning and leading high-complexity stories and epics\\n\\n* reviewing story docs and offering insights on impacts to other parts of the application\\n\\n* performing code reviews and helping to enforce our code and architectural standards\\n\\n* participating as a primary on-call resource for service disruptions\\n\\n* handling superfriend responsibilities with minimal assistance\\n\\n* acting as release owner\\n\\n* mentoring other developers\\n\\n* suggesting new technologies and techniques to improve developer productivity\\n\\n* agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product\\n\\n* collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices\\n\\n* and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nKey Things to Know\\n\\n\\n* This is a remote role\\n\\n* We want you to start ASAP\\n\\n* This is a full-time position\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBenefits\\n\\n\\n* Competitive salary\\n\\n* Unlimited vacation days\\n\\n* Stock options\\n\\n* Premium health insurance\\n\\n* Excellent gear (15” Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.)\\n\\n\\n  </div> </div>",

Our primary focus has been to assist progressive organizations, particularly those influencing the policy and political landscape, that advocate on behalf of underserved communities. Our software platforms have been a vital part of keeping such organizations successful and efficient.\\n\\nWho We Are\\n\\nWe are deeply committed to public service and progressive social change. We are 100% minority owned and operated with a diverse team, inclusive of gender, ethnicity, and race.\\n\\nPosition Summary\\n\\nThis role will focus on dev ops and back end/API development, but the ideal candidate will have a full stack skillset. Our stack is Postgres/Ruby/Rails/React. Right now we have a mix of HTML+jQuery and React but we are in the process of moving toward split app architecture. As part of that process we are building out a REST API and revamping our deployment environment. The latter would be the main focus of this position, but it would also involve pitching in on the React side of things when required.\\n\\nWe are seeking someone with excellent communication skills who will work as a team player and a self-starter. The ideal candidate should have mid-level experience, but they won’t be placed in some hierarchical structure. This position will work directly with the other developers, and will report directly to the CEO. The individual should be highly motivated to make a difference and to have an impact on moving progressive issues forward. Our employees’ opinions matter to us for the success of the company, and we want you to bring creative solutions to make our work better for our clients. Interest and understanding of politics and campaigns is a plus but not required.\\n\\nOur employees are from all over the country, and bring varying levels of experience to the company. First and foremost, we value honesty from all employees within our firm. We strongly encourage a work environment centered on open communication and conscientiousness. Working remotely gives our employees the ability to better maintain a work-life balance, but we expect that productivity and job performance will not be sacrificed.\\n\\nWe are a fully remote team so you will need to be flexible to work with staff in different time zones when necessary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n\\n\\n* Improve and maintain deployment environment and tools\\n\\n* Design and build efficient, reusable, and reliable Ruby code\\n\\n* Integration of data storage solutions Postgresql and Redis\\n\\n* Expand and improve test coverage\\n\\n* Identify bottlenecks and bugs then devise solutions to these problems\\n\\n* Help maintain code quality, organization, and automation\\n\\n* Integrations with external APIs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkills\\n\\n\\n* Experience setting up and maintaining deployment environments using Linux and Nginx\\n\\n* Knowledge of best practices and IT operations in an always-up, always-available service\\n\\n* Experience with automation/configuration management using either Puppet, Chef, or an equivalent\\n\\n* Ability to use a wide variety of open source technologies and cloud services\\n\\n* Strong experience with SQL and PostgreSQL\\n\\n* Advanced understanding of object-oriented programming\\n\\n* Experience with Ruby on Rails, along with common libraries such as Sidekiq\\n\\n* Intermediate understanding of the syntax of Ruby and its nuances\\n\\n* Intermediate understanding of Javascript and Jquery\\n\\n* Familiarity with front end frameworks such as Vue, React or Angular\\n\\n* Familiarity with concepts of MVC, ORM, and RESTful design patterns\\n\\n* A knack for writing clean, readable Ruby code\\n\\n* Ability to integrate multiple data sources and databases into one system\\n\\n* Understanding of fundamental design principles behind a scalable application\\n\\n* Able to create database schemas that represent and support business processes\\n\\n* Able to implement automated testing platforms and unit tests\\n\\n* Proficient understanding of code versioning tools such as Git\\n\\n* Familiarity with development aiding tools such as Bower, Bundler, Rake, etc.\\n\\n* Familiarity with continuous integration\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompensation: Salary commensurate with knowledge, experience, and qualifications.\\n\\nPolitech is an Equal Opportunity Employer that greatly values diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\\n\\nHow to apply\\n\\nApply with your GitHub account (or similar), resume, and cover letter. Introduce yourself to us as a colleague. Show us your future here! We value great writers, so be yourself, be creative. Stock cover letters won’t do. Tell us why you want this job. Let us know why you want to work at Politech and not somewhere else.\\n\\nYou should be able to show samples of your previous work upon request.  </div> </div>",

We are a fully distributed team with people working all around the world. You will have the flexibility and freedom to work in the environment of your choosing, whether that be at home, a cafe or co-working space. We're looking for a senior engineer to help build our API-First core app using JavaScript/AngularJS/React and Scala/Play.</p><p>ABOUT YOU</p><p>You love code. You love to take raw ideas and build great products with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You know JavaScript is imperfect, but you embrace its functional side and genuinely enjoy coding with it. You might like to talk about obscure computer science topics, but really, you just want to write simple code and ship new products and features to customers (or improve existing ones).</p><p>You love great UX. You spend most of your time coding, but you also have an eye for great design and a feel for great UX. Maybe you were once a designer (or still are) or maybe your creative outlet has always been the code. Either way, you care about more than just the code.</p><p>You love learning new things. You love researching new tech and driving forward with the implementation details. Your focus is on frontend JavaScript code, but you can dig in wherever needed. Scala, CSS, build tools, shell scripts, you name it. If you don't already know it, you're ready to learn it.</p><p>You can balance lots of concerns. Frontend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we can't control), customer demands, A/B tests, UX research, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. And we actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.</p><p>You love helping others. You love sharing knowledge with the rest of your team, building shared tooling for other engineers, giving back to the open-source community, and directly helping customers.</p><p>WHAT YOU’LL DO</p><ul><li>Research, guide, and execute frontend architecture changes, including but by no means limited to planning our migration to React, implementing Redux best practices, and transitioning code to TypeScript.</li><li>Build reusable React components, migrate AngularJS components to React, manage data on the client with Redux, and test everything with Jasmine.</li><li>Measure and resolve performance bottlenecks, using tools like Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, WebPageTest, or custom tooling.</li><li>Refactor or improve existing code. We're planning to migrate our frontend to React, but we still have a lot of AngularJS code to clean up. And we constantly find ways to improve all of our JavaScript code.</li><li>Work closely with our product, design, and UX teams to create amazing and intuitive experiences that make it effortless to connect different apps together.</li><li>Help put tools, processes, and documentation in place to improve our code quality.</li><li>Review code written by other team members or other teams.</li><li>Ship to hundreds of thousands of users every day while having lots of autonomy in terms of code and feature ownership.</li></ul><p>WHAT YOU’LL BRING</p><ul><li>5+ years of software development experience</li><li>Experience with building and maintaining a SaaS product at scale</li><li>An affinity for creating software that is extensible, performant, and easy to read</li><li>A degree in computer science, software engineering, or a related field</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://angel.co/company/process-street/jobs/558380-remote-senior-frontend-engineer-javascript-angularjs-react' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Process Street</h4>            <div><ul><li>Cameron McKay - CTO -&nbsp;<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdmckay' rel='nofollow'>https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdmckay</a></li><li>Alex Agulyansky - Engineering Team Lead&nbsp;-&nbsp;<a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexagulyansky/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexagulyansky</a></li></ul>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Interesting Product</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large user base where you can see features in action</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Profitable and stable company</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Experienced Team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Organized processes</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Clear roadmap strategy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>API First</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Our software platforms have been a vital part of keeping such organizations successful and efficient.</p><h5><strong>Who We Are</strong></h5><p>We are deeply committed to public service and progressive social change. We are 100% minority owned and operated with a diverse team, inclusive of gender, ethnicity, and race.</p><h5><strong>Position Summary</strong></h5><p>This role will focus on dev ops and back end/API development, but the ideal candidate will have a full stack skillset. Our stack is Postgres/Ruby/Rails/React. Right now we have a mix of HTML+jQuery and React but we are in the process of moving toward split app architecture. As part of that process we are building out a REST API and revamping our deployment environment. The latter would be the main focus of this position, but it would also involve pitching in on the React side of things when required.</p><p>We are seeking someone with excellent communication skills who will work as a team player and a self-starter. The ideal candidate should have mid-level experience, but they won’t be placed in some hierarchical structure. This position will work directly with the other developers, and will report directly to the CEO.

First and foremost, we value honesty from all employees within our firm. We strongly encourage a work environment centered on open communication and conscientiousness. Working remotely gives our employees the ability to better maintain a work-life balance, but we expect that productivity and job performance will not be sacrificed.</p><p>We are a fully remote team so you will need to be flexible to work with staff in different time zones when necessary.</p><h5><strong>Responsibilities</strong></h5><ul><li>Improve and maintain deployment environment and tools</li><li>Design and build efficient, reusable, and reliable Ruby code</li><li>Integration of data storage solutions Postgresql and Redis</li><li>Expand and improve test coverage</li><li>Identify bottlenecks and bugs then devise solutions to these problems</li><li>Help maintain code quality, organization, and automation</li><li>Integrations with external APIs</li></ul><h5><strong>Skills</strong></h5><ul><li>Experience setting up and maintaining deployment environments using Linux and Nginx</li><li>Knowledge of best practices and IT operations in an always-up, always-available service</li><li>Experience with automation/configuration management using either Puppet, Chef, or an equivalent</li><li>Ability to use a wide variety of open source technologies and cloud services</li><li>Strong experience with SQL and PostgreSQL</li><li>Advanced understanding of object-oriented programming</li><li>Experience with Ruby on Rails, along with common libraries such as Sidekiq</li><li>Intermediate understanding of the syntax of Ruby and its nuances</li><li>Intermediate understanding of Javascript and Jquery</li><li>Familiarity with front end frameworks such as Vue, React or Angular</li><li>Familiarity with concepts of MVC, ORM, and RESTful design patterns</li><li>A knack for writing clean, readable Ruby code</li><li>Ability to integrate multiple data sources and databases into one system</li><li>Understanding of fundamental design principles behind a scalable application</li><li>Able to create database schemas that represent and support business processes</li><li>Able to implement automated testing platforms and unit tests</li><li>Proficient understanding of code versioning tools such as Git</li><li>Familiarity with development aiding tools such as Bower, Bundler, Rake, etc.</li><li>Familiarity with continuous integration</li></ul><p><strong>Compensation:</strong> Salary commensurate with knowledge, experience, and qualifications.</p><p>Politech is an Equal Opportunity Employer that greatly values diversity at our company.

Introduce yourself to us as a colleague. Show us your future here! We value great writers, so be yourself, be creative. Stock cover letters won’t do. Tell us why you want this job.

Each of our apps has a dedicated team of designers and developers who are committed to refining and expanding their specific app in response to real customer needs.

There's no whiteboards, and no typing! Someone from our team will type as the two of you work through a pair programming exercise together.

The final step is a day in our San Diego office where you'll get to meet our leadership team and members of your potential new product team.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p><p>Our Client Team is now on the lookout for a Senior Frontend Engineer focused on UX and UI who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>The Client Domain is all about innovation. Here we shape our products to satisfy the needs of our heterogeneous customer base. To achieve this you will collaborate closely with the Backend Engineers of the Client Services Team to design the most optimal APIs to be used in our client applications.</p><p>As part of this team, you will play a key role in the development of our web and mobile applications for both, end users (i.e. players) and internal users (i.e. back office users). Building these from the ground up offers a great opportunity for you to take important decisions with regards to our architecture and workflows.</p><p>You will be tasked to find the right technology to solve the challenges we face, take responsibility for the implementation, and share your knowledge with your peers.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe.

You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>The base compensation range for this role is €50k-70k annually, depending on your background and experience. It can be subject to an adjustment of up to 15% in either direction if the cost-of-living in your region is far above or below the European average. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li><p>5+ years experience in developing complex web and mobile applications with JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Experience with CSS3 animations and transitions</p></li><li><p>Solid experience with at least one main frontend framework</p></li><li><p>Good knowledge of HTML and CSS standards</p></li><li><p>Good eye for detail and sense of composition</p></li><li><p>Passion for UX and understanding of web accessibility principles</p></li><li><p>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</p></li><li><p>Interest in taking full ownership of your applications and managing them in a production environment including the troubleshooting of live incidents</p></li><li><p>Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build</p></li><li><p>Highly process driven and eager to learn</p></li><li><p>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</p></li><li><p>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</p></li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/senior-frontend-engineer-uxui/c/new?source=Stack%20Overflow&amp;utm_source=stack_overflow&amp;utm_medium=job&amp;utm_campaign=client_elixir_senior' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
