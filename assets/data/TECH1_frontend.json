We own and operate The Hollywood Gossip, TV Fanatic and Food Fanatic, which launched in 2013 and marked a turning point in our relationship with publishers and the advertising industry.</p><p>With the inception of Food Fanatic, we learned from our contributors that when it comes to frustrations with the way most ad networks operate, we weren’t alone. We wanted to do better and put control back into the hands of the publishers.</p><p>Networks typically treat publishers as if they, and the advertisers, are the only ones with value, dictating how publishers should run their sites, how they should handle advertising, and how they should be paid in a one-sided relationship.</p><p>We’re changing that. After pioneering new ad tech strategies allowing our own sites to thrive like never before, a few Food Fanatic contributors asked us if we could do better for them too. From that point forward, Mediavine was born.</p><p>Mediavine is privately owned, with no outside investors. We answer to our publishers and our ad partners, making us the most agile company in this space. We’re founded by publishers, owned by publishers, and ready to help you navigate the future of ads as a publisher yourself.</p>            </div>        ",

Do you have a passion for working with Product Managers to shape and deliver outstanding products for our customers?&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re Bloom &amp; Wild, the UK&rsquo;s most loved online florist. We&rsquo;re using technology to reimagine the experience of buying and receiving flowers, connecting people more thoughtfully to make sending flowers a joy to send and a delight to receive. In doing so we're aiming to become Europe&rsquo;s most loved flower brand. We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;20million in venture capital funding and were recently named as the second-fastest growing tech company in the UK by Deloitte. One of the Tech Nation &ldquo;Future Fifty&rdquo; alumni and one of the Sunday Times Top 100 Small Companies to Work For 2020, we&rsquo;re now the fastest growing online flower company in Europe.</p><br /><p>Our business has, so far, been in the fortunate position to be able to continue trading and growing during this time of economic uncertainty, with the Government actively encouraging online retail, and customer demand for flowers for their loved ones is strong due to social distancing measures in place.</p><br /><p>This is a great opportunity for a Software Engineering Manager with people management experience to lead two cross functional engineering squads. You will report to Steve, our VP Engineering who is extremely passionate about people development and scaling teams. You&rsquo;ll get to shape both people and platforms to support our ambitious growth plans and take part in the next phase of our success.</p><br /><p>In Technology we're split into three squads with a fourth on the way. You'll start by leading the Growth squad, which focuses on driving profitable customer acquisition across all of our markets.&nbsp; This means helping to inspire our customers to understand, find, compare and select their perfect gift as well as working on improvements to our core checkout flow - delightfully expressing our brand to new customers and making it easy to order flowers.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll then play a leading part in the setup and day to day running of our new Expansion squad, with a mission to accelerate growth outside our UK core business. You&rsquo;ll work closely with our VP of Business Development as the squad works on solutions that build our international markets, develop new distribution channels and support the development of new products and services.</p><br /><p><strong>About you</strong></p><br /><p>Building diverse, happy, high performing squads will be a key part of what you do.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We believe strongly in giving our squads autonomy, while using cross team communities of practice and company wide OKRs to ensure alignment. You&rsquo;ll need to be comfortable working at pace, while fostering a mindset of continuous improvement within the squad, evolving and extending the agile, iterative approach to meet the squad&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll play a leading part in delivering the product and technology roadmap, and ensuring that customer needs are at the forefront of the squad members minds. We favour a collaborative, data-driven and experimental approach to solving complex problems, and expect our Engineering Managers to foster this mindset in their squads. You&rsquo;ll ensure that there is a focus on scrum mastery within your squad, either by playing the role yourself or empowering a squad member to assist you.</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll work closely with other Engineering Managers, VP Engineering and community of practice leads to shape the technology roadmap and strategy going forwards, ensuring that we are improving the whole team and optimising the approach for more than just your squad.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Ideally your background will be in frontend development and this will enable you to help your squad interpret requirements into something they can deliver as you work with them to find the right technical approach. Working with our VP Engineering and Technology Leadership team, you&rsquo;ll help to solve our top priority problems for the quarter from a technology and people perspective.</p><br /><p>As an experienced people manager you&rsquo;ll take responsibility for performance management, career progression, pastoral care and everything else that means that you have a happy and motivated squad. The team environment that you create will promote both autonomy and accountability. You&rsquo;ll be a great coach and servant leader, able to motivate and guide the squad through the good times and the bad, learning and improving as you go.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We care about creating a diverse and inclusive team - it's what helps us generate the best ideas and grow faster. We want to make giving and receiving gifts a joy for everyone, and to do this we need people from all backgrounds, with different perspectives and ideas. We welcome anyone to apply, with the knowledge that you&rsquo;ll have the freedom to give your opinion, do your best work and be part of a genuinely inclusive, friendly and caring team.</p><br /><p><strong>Our tech</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll also get to work with some great technology. Our stack consists of iOS and Android apps, an Angular 7 website and backend platform in Ruby on Rails. We encourage our developers to be full stack and our squads to own their code from their local machine into usage in production. We&rsquo;re focusing heavily on increasing our usage of machine learning and automation of our business processes so we can continue to scale at pace. You can read more about our technology over on our tech blog - <a href='https://medium.com/code-wild'>Code &amp; Wild.</a></p><br /><p><strong>Work environment</strong></p><br /><p>Currently our full team is working from home and adapting quickly to being totally remote. In addition to our normal perks and benefits we&rsquo;re supporting each other and maintaining our culture remotely through:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Regular virtual yoga classes with more virtual exercise variety to come!</li><br /><li>Celebrating birthdays with letterbox cake</li><br /><li>Weekly &lsquo;team drinks trolleys&rsquo; and updates from our senior team</li><br /><li>Remote lunch and learns</li><br /><li>Supporting our wellbeing through online support sessions and employee assistance program</li><br /><li>New slack channels and ways of communicating including wellbeing channels</li><br /><li>Specialist online support to talk about the challenges we are facing in the current environment</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>When we&rsquo;re in the office:</strong></p><br /><p>Our lovely, light and spacious office is conveniently located close to Vauxhall and Oval stations in London.

That same product is at the edge of where careers are headed, where every person becomes their own brand with limitless growth potential ahead. That's the opportunity at vidIQ – an infinite market, a large and highly engaged customer base, and the chance to help build and scale vidIQ's data engine that drives insights for millions of creators.<br><br></div><h3><strong>Intro</strong></h3><div><strong><br>Why this Role?

Applications submitted without a cover letter will not be considered. Please give examples that showcase the required skills identified in this job description.**Position Overview**Clarity, a Series A clean-tech startup, is looking for an experienced full-stack tech lead to spearhead our software team and join the mission of bringing clear air to the world. He or she will drive the technical evolution of our IoT sensor data pipeline, customer-facing web applications, and data analysis tools. Clarity is a globally distributed organization with headquarters in Oakland, CA.**Our Company**At Clarity, we strive to empower the world to reduce air pollution. We do that by making it accessible for cities and industries to measure and understand their air pollution issues and take effective action.Today, when cities and industrial facilities want to measure air quality at a site they have to purchase expensive monitoring equipment and invest even more to install it in container-sized shelters and integrate its measurements into their IT system. This is unacceptable because it leads to the inability to monitor air pollution at important sites and ultimately to the inability to manage air pollution.We envision a world where novel sensing technology, IoT and cloud computing simplify air quality measurement, enabling cities and industrial facilities to scale up the number of monitoring sites and take data-driven action.Our Sensing-as-a-Service solution for air quality is currently deployed in over 70 cities across 30+ countries and is changing how municipalities and industrial facilities monitor their air quality.After successfully raising our Series A (a few words from our investors [here](https://www.ramanan.com/personal-blog/amasias-investment-in-clarity-movement) and [here](https://medium.com/speroventures/the-air-we-breathe-c52094aa2f46)), we are excited to keep building on our current success elevating our product to the next level, at the forefront of the clean air movement. This is especially true of our software products, where we see a significant opportunity to increase the value we provide to our customers as well as to expand the number of use cases supported by our Sensing-as-a-Service solution.**Our Team**We are a diverse group of engineers, scientists, and makers from all around the world who are passionate about what we do and devoted to our mission to improve the world by solving some of its greatest challenges.We believe in solving challenging problems by adopting a growth mindset, by fostering an environment that encourages deep collaboration, empathy, and creativity, and by keeping a good sense of humor. We enjoy philosophical debates as much as nerding out about the soldering talents of our HW engineers or the cool data visualizations we create.Although we always have our mission in mind, we know the path for any startup has ups and downs and we’re more than happy to face them together as a team. How else could you tackle a problem as complex and global as air pollution?**Job Description**We are seeking a highly self-motivated and passionate full-stack developer with a proven leadership track record to bring our Clarity Cloud to the next level. We expect you to begin by working 70% on development and 30% on leading and mentoring our software engineers (3 full-time developers at the moment), setting technical direction and curating an Agile delivery process.

This is a good starting place to see if that might be you:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>We think your gender, race and sexuality are your business and irrelevant to how good you are at your job. It&rsquo;s important to us that you feel the same way about others.</li><br /><li>We care about our work and what we do is an important part of our lives. It matters to us and it matters that you feel the same.</li><br /><li>We seek truth in our conversations. We each care about reaching the right conclusion and learning, not worrying about who came up with the idea.

We&rsquo;re much more interested in knowing what you&rsquo;ve done and hear your stories.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><br /><strong>Your Package</strong><br /><br /><br /><br /></p><br /><p>Your renumeration should be about more than money. This is what we offer:</p><br /><ul><br /><li><strong>Salary:</strong>&nbsp;Salary is dependant on what you bring to the role and will depend on the individual candidate.

The exact amount will depend on what you bring to the role.

We'll take any problems you have seriously and we'll strive to make sure that Reachora is a great place for you to work.</li><br /><li><strong>Technology:</strong>&nbsp;We'll give you a shiny new Macbook for you to enjoy creating on.</li><br /><li><strong>Holiday:</strong>&nbsp;Our team has a flexible holiday allowance. We believe rest and variety are crucial for a healthy, creative mind and so insist that you take at least 30 days off each year.</li><br /><li><strong>Lifestyle:</strong>&nbsp;Live and work from wherever makes you the happiest and most productive. Hobbies and family are just as important as work, and we'll always try and support you in what you do.</li><br /><li><strong>Learning:</strong>&nbsp;There's little more important than personal development.

This has been enabled by hosted collaboration solutions like github and bitbucket.

The product is live and we are running trials with early adopters. There is lots more functionality to build and some to refine. We are Bristol-based, but lockdown has really made us think about continuing as a distributed company. So who knows - if we get along well, future working relationships could emerge from this opportunity!&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Note this is a voluntary project and not a paid role, likely suiting someone on furlough looking to learn / apply a new skill.</p><br /><p>Thank you for reading, we look forward to hearing from you!</p>",

We sell an expanding variety of photo and home products, including photo blankets, photo books, canvases, pillows, and more. Our company has been featured on the TODAY Show, The View, and Good Morning America many times. We are a 100% employee-owned company that has rapidly grown to 40 employees and $25M annual revenue over the past five years.</p> <p> As a 100% remote company, we are set up to provide the best possible environment for engineering. The less time developers spend dealing with cumbersome processes, inefficient systems, and commuting, the more time they have to solve problems and make an impact. Collage.com’s co-founders/co-CEOs both come from a technical background and believe in staying at the forefront of best practices so that we can focus on work that matters. We pass almost all of The Joel Test (we only fix high-priority bugs before writing new code, but hey, we’re a start-up), use continuous deployment (code goes straight to production after each merge), and are in the process of adopting mobx-state-tree with React. Strong engineering is a key part of our business strategy -- it lets us build best-in-class design tools faster than our larger competitors.</p> <p> We are seeking an ambitious and nice lead software engineer who shares our passion for building a great software company. This is a unique opportunity to have a major impact on our engineering team’s growth (we are about ten strong right now) by helping us continually raise the bar. You will be expected to collaborate with other engineers to solve complex technical problems and push us to deliver higher quality code at an ever-increasing rate. We firmly believe in the power of solid architecture, code design, and simplicity over brute force, which is why we do our best to hire 10x senior engineers. If you are seeking an environment where you get to do meaningful work with other great engineers, then we want to hear from you.</p> <p> Learn more about working and developing software at Collage.com.</p> <p> </p><p> <b> <b> Responsibilities</b> </b> </p>    Write and maintain front-end JavaScript code as part of a mobile-first web application, including UI components and state management logic, as well as back-end PHP and front-end network communication code (back end is approximately 10% of work).  Make decisions about code design, architecture, and refactoring to balance technical debt against delivering functionality.  Plan and lead testing for complex projects.  Review code and mentor other engineers.  Provide time estimates and participate in agile development.  Review specifications and work with PMs to implement lean methodology.  <p> </p><p> <b> <b> Required Qualifications</b> </b> </p>    5+ years professional application development experience  Experience implementing and testing advanced JavaScript code on a team as part of a production web or mobile application  Practical experience with MV* architecture (such as Backbone, Vue, React + Redux/Mobx, etc.), unidirectional data flow, and minimal class/object interfaces  Spatial/geometric reasoning ability -- for rendering, animation, and image manipulation  Ability to quickly understand and work with unfamiliar complex code  Pro-active and clear communication is essential for this remote work position  <p> </p><p> <b> <b> Benefits and Perks</b> </b> </p>    Working from home makes it easier to focus on results and develop professionally while spending less time commuting. (See our opinion piece on perks and work-life balance at mlive.com.)  401(k) plan, home internet reimbursement, and $3,000 / year in free Collage.com products plus employee discount for friends and family.  Collage.com pays 100% of the premium for full health, vision and dental insurance coverage for you and your family in a high-quality Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO plan.  Flexible work schedule and unlimited vacation policy (work hard and take time when you need it).  We’ll pay for any computer and home office equipment (within reason) that will help you work better.  <p> </p><p> <b> <b> The Interview Process</b> </b> </p>  <p> The goal of our interview process is to identify people who will be a good fit for our company and are talented, ambitious engineers. Because you will be working remotely, all of our interviews are done over the phone in close succession to move through the process quickly. We look for candidates with good written and verbal communication skills.</p> <p> We ask all candidates to demonstrate strong coding ability at the beginning of our interview process. The questions are in Javascript and focus on applying general programming concepts (like concurrency and good code structure) in realistic scenarios that should be familiar to experienced engineers. We do not test for knowledge of esoteric language features, APIs, or algorithms. We prefer engineers who are smart and able to learn over those who are familiar with our exact tech stack.</p> <p> During the interview process, you will talk to other engineers, your future manager, a product manager, and both founders/CEOs of the company. We believe in transparency, and will give you the opportunity to speak with anyone else you’d like to meet before accepting an offer. You are making an important decision, and we want to make sure you are fully committed to joining our team.</p></div>",

As such, Sitka is experiencing a surge in demand and continuing to scale the team.</em></p><p>Sitka provides doctors and patients on-demand access to our network of specialists through our unique technology platform. With Sitka, patients receive personalized video reviews of their medical data from experts. Our platform allows patients and their doctors to consult with specialists easily and quickly, usually with turnarounds of hours instead of weeks.</p><p>We believe meaningful improvement in medicine requires new systems enabling convenient, conversational workflows between patients and their physicians, not tedious and documentation-heavy processes. As such, we integrate our platform deeply into complicated health systems so that providers can leverage our specialists easily and make better clinical decisions over video.</p><p>As a small, fully-remote startup, there are no big-company cog-in-the-machine roles. Everything and everyone matters, so we hire with that in mind. We value diversity, not just because building services for diverse populations requires a diverse team, but because we personally feel it's the right thing to do.</p><h4>About the job</h4><p>Sitka engineers progressively bring order to the chaos of medicine. We work closely with our clinical practitioners and patients, rapidly iterating on the product and workflow to solve real problems in real clinics.</p><p>The platform we build serves patient, primary care, and specialist workflows in friendly-yet-compliant ways while providing robust tools around synchronous and asynchronous video and annotation. Sitka is a modern API-based web application — we use React to build our user-facing front-end, Python for our back-end web services, and we deploy containerized services to AWS.</p><p>You’d report to the CTO on a fully-remote team with tremendous flexibility to define the shape of the product, technical architecture and company itself. As an early engineer, you will be a critical member of the team, with your work directly affecting the success or failure of the company. The scope of your potential impact is limited only by your ambition and ability to get things done.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul>    <li>You are a seasoned software engineer that enjoys writing Python, and have at least 3 years of experience doing so.</li>    <li>You've designed and implemented complicated data architectures for a real-world service in either RDBMS or NoSQL storage systems (or both for extra points).</li>    <li>You understand modern web architecture - how the pieces fit together, how to build robust and reliable services, how to manage complexity as a service grows.</li>    <li>You like learning new things, teaching what you know to others and generally aren’t a jerk about it.</li>    <li>You’re capable of solving whole problems with lots of ambiguity. We’re a startup doing things that nobody has done before. This means building things with imperfect information and building for adaptation when your assumptions are wrong. It’s not for everyone.</li>    <li>You care about building an engineering culture based on diversity, respect, recognition and trust.</li></ul><h4>Extra credit!</h4><ul>    <li>You're a senior engineer. If you have 15+ years of experience building complex systems, great!</li>    <li>You’ve worked on complicated, multiparty workflow systems.</li>    <li>You’ve dealt with HIPAA and survived with your sanity intact (intactness of sanity is strictly optional).</li>    <li>You’ve built systems on AWS.</li>    <li>You’ve worked on streaming video.</li></ul><p></p>                      <h4>Desired Skills</h4>            <ul>                              <li><span>Amazon Web Services</span></li>                              <li><span>ReactJS</span></li>                          </ul>                                          <h4>Contact Info</h4>            <ul>                                          <li><strong>Company Website:</strong> <a href='https://trustsitka.com/' rel='nofollow'>https://trustsitka.com/</a></li>            </ul>                  </div><a href='https://angel.co/company/sitka-3/jobs/809614-remote-senior-backend-software-engineer-python' rel='nofollow'>Apply</a>",

With Sitka, patients receive personalized video reviews of their medical data from experts. Our platform allows patients and their doctors to consult with specialists easily and quickly, usually with turnarounds of hours instead of weeks.</p><p>We believe meaningful improvement in medicine requires new systems enabling convenient, conversational workflows between patients and their physicians, not tedious and documentation-heavy processes. As such, we integrate our platform deeply into complicated health systems so that providers can leverage our specialists easily and make better clinical decisions over video.</p><p>As a small, fully-remote startup, there are no big-company cog-in-the-machine roles. Everything and everyone matters, so we hire with that in mind. We value diversity, not just because building services for diverse populations requires a diverse team, but because we personally feel it’s the right thing to do.</p><h3><strong>About the job</strong></h3><p>Sitka engineers progressively bring order to the chaos of medicine. We work closely with our clinical practitioners and patients, rapidly iterating on the product and workflow to solve real problems in real clinics.</p><p>The platform we build serves patient, primary care, and specialist workflows in friendly-yet-compliant ways while providing robust tools around synchronous and asynchronous video and annotation. Sitka is a modern API-based web application — we use React to build our user-facing front-end, Python for our back-end web services, and we deploy containerized services to AWS.</p><p>You’d report to the CTO on a fully-remote team with tremendous flexibility to define the shape of the product, technical architecture and company itself. As an early engineer, you will be a critical member of the team, with your work directly affecting the success or failure of the company. The scope of your potential impact is limited only by your ambition and ability to get things done.</p></div></div><div><h3><strong>Requirements</strong></h3><div><ul><li>You are a seasoned software engineer that enjoys writing Python, and have at least 3 years of experience doing so.</li><li>You’ve designed and implemented complicated data architectures for a real-world service in either RDBMS or NoSQL storage systems (or both for extra points).</li><li>You understand modern web architecture – how the pieces fit together, how to build robust and reliable services, how to manage complexity as a service grows.</li><li>You like learning new things, teaching what you know to others and generally aren’t a jerk about it.</li><li>You’re capable of solving whole problems with lots of ambiguity. We’re a startup doing things that nobody has done before. This means building things with imperfect information and building for adaptation when your assumptions are wrong. It’s not for everyone.</li><li>You care about building an engineering culture based on diversity, respect, recognition and trust.</li></ul><h3><strong>Extra credit!</strong></h3><ul><li>You’re a senior engineer. If you have 15+ years of experience building complex systems, great!</li><li>You’ve worked on complicated, multiparty workflow systems.</li><li>You’ve dealt with HIPAA and survived with your sanity intact (intactness of sanity is strictly optional).</li><li>You’ve built systems on AWS.</li><li>You’ve worked on streaming video.</li></ul><p>Location: <strong>US Locations Only</strong></p></div></div></div></div>        </div><div>        <a href='https://apply.workable.com/trustsitkacareers/j/916C124197/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

HourStack helps agencies, internal teams, and individual users to track and manage their time more efficiently so they can focus on tasks and projects with the most business impact. With a range of integrations, users can streamline their workflow with current applications already in use, all in a visual drag-and-drop calendar.</div><div><strong><br>The current team</strong></div><div>We're a small yet diverse group of people with backgrounds in software development, marketing and many other miscellaneous things. Self-funded by previous business successes, we're an intentionally lean and agile team that has a passion for startups and software, where we prioritize optimizing product functionality with great customer support. We believe in working remotely from our favorite places, hopping on calls, or meeting up in person when we need to dig a bit deeper into problem-solving.<br><br></div><div>We acquired HourStack late last year and have been working diligently to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the product through surveys, customer interviews, etc. We received amazing feedback from customers who love the product and are excited to see it continue to evolve.<br><br></div><div>We have 500 paying teams using HourStack daily and now have a clear roadmap to fill in the gaps in the product, make enhancements where needed, and really solidify the product/market fit so we can scale to thousands of paying teams over the coming years.</div><div><strong><br>Your role with us<br></strong>We're hiring an experienced frontend developer to help us build HourStack. First, you'll be working on an all new version of HourStack's web app. We're finishing up our new REST API and are in the process of finalizing the UI, so you're on deck! Building the new web app is just the beginning though.<br><br></div><div>We'll be building out a slew of new integrations, cross-platform mobile and desktop apps, creating great documentation for our customers, supporting our sales and marketing teammates, and continually iterating on the product based on customer feedback.<br><br><strong>Technologies we use<br></strong>We utilize a LEMP stack and our cloud of choice is DigitalOcean. We are open to working with either React or Vue.js for the web app and other technologies and services you'll use on the frontend include Javascript (ES6), Typescript, Webpack, Babel, Sass, JSON, NPM, Git (GitHub), Pusher, REST, GraphQL, etc.<br><br>For collaboration we use Notion. For synchronous communication we use Slack or Zoom and for asynchronous communication we use email and Loom. For design we use Sketch.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Qualifications you need<br></strong>You must be an experienced (3+ years) developer who has a track record of building solid products and experiences that customers love. You have a good feel for great UX and enough of a design eye to make UI decisions when required. You are familiar with the technologies we use and have deep experience with most so you can hit the ground running.<br><br></div><div>You must love to be productive! We are building a productivity product here, but you will also be working with a small, dedicated, and focused team that knows how to crank out very high quality work. We all enjoy having significant amounts of uninterrupted work time to maximize our productivity.<br><br></div><div>You'll also need to have experience working remotely and the skills that come along with that such as excellent written and verbal communication, self-motivation, flexibility, reliability, etc.<br><br><strong>What we offer<br></strong>Currently our team is in Seattle, though we work remotely and are willing to consider candidates from other parts of the US/World given some overlap with our timezone (PT). This is a full-time contract position through the end of 2020 with the option for extension or full-time employment in 2021 if everyone is on board. We pay monthly at a rate of $7-10K depending on experience, qualifications, and fit with the team.</div></div>",

We provide online storefront as well as give logistics support to local grocery supermarkets to help them be competitive with pure online stores. We believe in making the local grocer be competitive enough that it can take the whole consumption potential around its 1-2 km radius. Doing all these in a unit-economics positive way (yeah, I know) is our goal, and we already are quite close to achieving 0 burn per delivery. Higher concentration of demand, Sensible delivery radius and flexible delivery SLA - is what is making this possible. We're currently operational in parts of BLR.We've been remote for few months before COVID-19 with occassional meet for brainstorming and nailing down of requirements across team.</p><p>Stack: Python/NodeJS/MySQL/Kubernetes on GCP on the backend.

Every day, veterinarians risk themselves to take care of your pets, and we're working every day at Vetspire to build them the tools to do so while following social-distancing best practices.<p>Vetspire is an AI-driven medical records and practice management platform for veterinarians. We’re a startup that builds the technology suite that powers veterinary hospitals, impacting every aspect of patient care from AI assistance in the exam room to managing client communications and clinical analytics.</p><p>We're looking for a full stack engineer to join our small and technical team to help bring veterinarians’ dreams into fruition. Your day to day work will consist of learning and understanding veterinarians' and veterinary staff needs and bringing them into reality from the front-end to the backend. Some examples of what your weeks may look like: building remote tools for pet owners to sign consent forms, pay invoices, and fill in information online so they don't have to walk into the clinics during the pandemic, creating an emergency room clinical census to monitor patients and alert staff in real-time, or designing the interface and algorithms for intelligent immunization reminders.</p><p>You'll be working directly with our clients (the veterinarians and staff) using Vetspire, and talking with them almost every day to better understand their needs and iterate on solutions with them. It's an incredibly fulfilling role to be able to make such a drastic difference in the lives of vets, and ultimately, everyone's pets. As such, this is more than just an engineering role, as, although you can code and develop remotely, you'll be expected to go into the hospitals every now and then to talk with the users directly, understand their needs, design solutions with them, and iterate on the results.</p><p>Our backend tech stack is a GraphQL Phoenix/Absinthe application written in Elixir, our front end is a React SPA using the Apollo GraphQL framework, our primary database is PostgreSQL, and it all runs on Google Cloud via Kubernetes.</p><p>Email me if interested at sam@vetspire.com (include &quot;HN&quot; in the subject).</p>",

A small pivot has led to great product-market fit, and we now have acres of green field that need designing &amp; coding.</p><p>How we make money: If you own a building that leases to office or commercial tenants, you need insurance. This is true if the economy is growing or crumbling. And as a result of this mandatory nature, this industry has not evolved to use modern technology. Workflows are manual. Communication is messy and time-consuming. People often don’t know what they’re buying or why. Obie sells commercial real estate insurance in a new way, one which emphasizes transparency and human-centric automation.</p><p>Our stack is Typescript, Node, GraphQL, and React. You should have ample experience in at least one of these technologies. Several years in overall coding experience is preferred, although the quality of this experience will be valued more highly than its duration.</p><p>To apply (or if you're just curious) please email careers@obiecre.com.</p>",

We strive to empower users to go from pipeline idea to massively scalable and easily debugged execution with minimal friction. Conducto works equally well for quick exploratory data science research pipelines and mission-critical production devops pipelines. It scales seamlessly from a handful of tasks to millions. Almost every developer and data scientist needs to create pipelines, and we believe that no currently available tool solves that problem as generally or elegantly as Conducto.\\n\\nPrior to forming Conducto, we spent 10 years building the software that powered one of the most successful algorithmic trading teams in the world. We were really really good. We succeeded because we built a team of technically strong, driven generalists who were excited to solve challenging problems. We have re-created that dynamic with our core team at Conducto, and are excited to grow the team.\\n\\nOur team is currently spread across the United States, from the East Coast to Hawai`i, and we have been an all-remote company since we started.\\n\\nIf you are excited to:\\n\\n\\n* work with a team of solid and driven generalists\\n\\n* build a highly available web app with non-trivial cloud infrastructure\\n\\n* find the balance between building beautiful abstractions and actually deliver a product\\n\\n* join a fast-growing and exciting startup\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthen we encourage you to apply to join us.&nbsp;\\n\\nSkills you’ll need:\\n\\n\\n* 3+ years experience building beautiful web apps\\n\\n* UI/UX implementation\\n\\n* Javascript, React, and Redux experience necessary.\\n\\n* UI testing, cross-browser compatibility, and performance tuning\\n\\n* Unit test framework experience, particularly Jest and Cypress\\n\\n* Appreciates balance between writing elegant code and actually delivering a product\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBonus points:\\n\\n\\n* Node.js&nbsp;\\n\\n* UI/UX design experience a plus\\n\\n* Knowledge of REST, Push API, and websockets\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe don't care where you went to school or what companies you have worked at. We aren't impressed by big names and buzzwords. We care about finding people who are great developers, are passionate to build this company, and will lean-in to a warm and collaborative company culture. We hope you will be a good match for the team.\\n\\nApplication Process:\\nWe have to be very selective, as we do not have the bandwidth to interview many candidates. So, if you apply and your resume and cover letter pass our initial review, we will invite you to take an online coding challenge. We will be interviewing a small number of candidates based on the results of that challenge.  </div> </div>",

We’ve been around since 1991, and we’re still going strong.&nbsp;</p><p>Our ideal developers thrive in the environment of variety and challenge that is inherent to custom software development, working with us in a long-term relationship over many projects for numerous clients.</p><p>Since we do custom software development, the skills and needs for each project can vary widely. This goes beyond just the languages we use, to the industries and problem domains we work in. We look for generalists; most importantly those who are excited to learn and take on new challenges. You can expect to grow both in your strength and your versatility when working here. We want to help you do so.</p><p>We work remotely all over the United States and Canada. We expect you to be able to work well on your own and comfortably with teams. You won’t have someone looking over your shoulder so you'll need to be communicative and reliable, and hold yourself accountable. We depend on each other.</p><p>Art+Logic is run by humans, who work and create using technology. Things can go wrong and we need to respond to the unexpected by being kind, considerate, fair, flexible, and calm. We treat our clients and peers as respectfully as we would like to be treated.</p><p>Here’s an example of some projects we’ve worked on recently, so you can better understand the wide range of projects and challenges we undertake:</p><ul><li>Implementing a Django-based DoD CAC card login</li><li>Writing a data model layer using SQLAlchemy to provide an object-oriented view of a legacy relational database schema. This model layer provides all business rules and data integrity using advanced python3 features. This data model in turn serves a REST API (python-pyramid) consumed by an advanced single-page web application written with Marionette (Backbone)</li><li>Created Windows tablet application to communicate with client's modbus hardware and upload data to Python/Django/Vue webapp for analysis and display</li></ul><p><strong>What we want from you: (aka: skills)</strong></p><p>We currently have a high demand for Python, specifically Django, and JavaScript web framework experience.&nbsp;</p><p>However, more important than that, we are looking for people who are curious and looking for opportunities to learn. People who like learning and creating on their own. Those who are able to drive themselves or even lead others when completing projects. Developers who are able to organize and express their ideas. Communication is paramount here.</p><p><strong>Relationship Details:</strong></p><p>We are looking for Contractors (1099) for long term open-ended relationships. Work hours are flexible; requiring reasonable overlap with normal working hours to support team communications, and not just nights and weekends. Our rates range from $35-$55/hour. We are ONLY looking for people in the United States and Canada.</p><p>We want you to enjoy working for us, and to be able to have a life outside of work. Since you're not commuting you can embrace the freedom of working from where you enjoy living, and use the saved time for your personal life and relationships. We don’t ask our developers to work consistently over 40 hours/week.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s important to us in the hiring process that we allow developers to demonstrate their abilities by actually developing something, because a list of previous employers or educational background aren’t always indicators of what someone can do. All applicants are asked to submit a solution to a programming challenge that emulates a task we might assign on a project.&nbsp;</p>            </div>        <div>        <a href='https://grnh.se/e53e22833' rel='nofollow'>            Apply        </a>                            </div>            <h4>About Art &amp; Logic, Inc.</h4>            <div><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://artandlogic.com/careers</a></li><li>Visit our Twitter @artandlogic</li></ul></ul>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Art+Logic Conference</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We are an international collective&nbsp;of industry leaders, conference speakers, and subject matter experts within React and React Native that are passionate about working remotely and doing good in the world.</p><p>We match technically vetted engineers to pre-vetted clients. Say goodbye to hunting business, drawing up contracts, and working on dying tech. With one production focused, to the point code challenge (no whiteboarding or algorithms + on your own time) vetted by our engineering team, you'll have the opportunity to receive curated contract opportunities as well as become a part of an international collective of React experts. If that sounds up your alley or you would like to find out more, please feel free to reach out to <a href='mailto:dylan@g2i.co' rel='nofollow'>dylan@g2i.co</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>G2i is short for &quot;Good News to the Internet.&quot; We are convinced that our primary vision &amp; mission are good news to companies that need to hire engineers. While we are going about fulfilling that primary vision &amp; mission, we will also be good news to those in need. We are on a mission to help hundreds of street kids&nbsp;in Nairobi, Kenya obtain education, a safe home,&nbsp;parental care, and the love they need. We are also committed to supporting the open-source community by finding ways to financially support those who build the OSS we rely on.</p><p><strong>Your background</strong></p><p>In simple terms we want to hire an engineer that is excited about building applications in React Native, is comfortable working in dynamic engineering environments and has strong communication and documentation skills. Here is what this actually means to us:</p><ul><li>You have 1+ years of professional development experience and have at least 1 year of React Native and/or React production experience.</li><li>You are willing to complete a code challenge that often takes 6-8 hours to complete (there are no due dates or timers however).</li><li>You live in North America or South America.</li><li>You are fluent in both verbal and written English and are comfortable communicating directly with technical and non-technical clients.</li><li>You are available 30-40 hours per week.</li><li>You might have full-stack experience with either Rails, Node.js, Apollo Client/GraphQL,&nbsp;native Android (Java, Kotlin) or iOS (Objective C, Swift). But if you don't, that's OK too!</li><li>You have prior experience as a freelancer or are someone that enjoys having the freedom to choose the types of projects that best align with your interests.</li><li>You are flexible and can adjust to the working styles of different teams. Some teams may want to pair-program and have daily interaction others may want engineers to work independently and only interact a few hours per week.</li></ul><p><strong>Vetting - Developers and Clients</strong></p><p>We match technically vetted engineers to pre-vetted clients who place a high value on engineering and focus on running healthy projects. We take care of contracts, billing, payments and all of the other work that goes into freelancing so that engineers can focus on code and clients on building their product. Our vision is for the hiring process to be simple, trustworthy and enjoyable for both companies and engineers.</p><p>When we vet clients we make sure they:</p><ul><li>Prioritize communication</li><li>Plan appropriately and have realistic timelines</li><li>Understand the cost of healthy development and have a budget to pay for it</li></ul><p>When we vet engineers we make sure:</p><ul><li>Engineers vet other engineers</li><li>Our code challenges are to the point and based on production-level code, no whiteboarding</li><li>Our process is objective, repeatable and quantitively scored</li><li>Our process is completely transparent</li></ul><p><strong>Who you will work with</strong></p><p>We only work with companies that value engineers and run healthy engineering teams. We regularly partner with&nbsp;<a href='http://www.ycombinator.com/' rel='nofollow'>Y Combinator</a>&nbsp;funded product companies that place a high value on engineering. Some of the companies we have worked with are: Lattice, Major League Soccer, ZeeMee, Software Engineering Daily, and Truebill with new clients coming in weekly.</p><p><strong>Diversity</strong></p><p>G2i is an equal opportunity employer.

By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.</p><p>We are a socially conscious, distributed team. We give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living where you’re most comfortable and working in areas where you can help foster and grow the community that you are a part of.</p><p>We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth. As one of our first front-end developers, your decisions will have an outsized influence on the future of our product.&nbsp; You’ll take input from product, design, and customers and then you’ll collaborate with other experienced, passionate engineering team to build the frameworks and features that will support our customers now, and in the future.</p><p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborative.&nbsp;</strong>You know that your colleagues’ perspectives will make our customers successful. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together. You propose ways for us to be more engaged and successful with our customers.</li><li><strong>Customer focused</strong>. Our customers are at the forefront of your day.&nbsp; You prioritize our customers’ voice to ensure their needs are met.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ambitious, curious, and resourceful.&nbsp;</strong>You are innately curious, and you aren’t afraid to work hard. You are self driven, you take direction well but are able to be creative to find results on your own when asked. You are driven to succeed because your hard work and results make you proud.</li><li><strong>Disciplined and reliable.</strong>&nbsp; We are a distributed company and you enjoy the benefits of working distributed while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.</li><li><strong>Appreciative of honest feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</li><li><strong>Work smarter and harder.</strong>&nbsp;You often identify a problem, create a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own.&nbsp; You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful.</li></ul><p><strong>Crisp's Frontend Tech Stack&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Statically typed, modern languages.</strong>&nbsp;We use TypeScript and React for the UI, and GraphQL with Apollo to communicate with our backend.&nbsp; Knowledge of these specific technologies is not a requirement. If you’re willing to learn, we’re willing to help you along the way.</li><li><strong>Continuous deployment.</strong>&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</li><li><strong>Micro-services.</strong>&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.</li><li><strong>Start-up mode.</strong>&nbsp; The team is still small, and the product is fresh.&nbsp; You’ll be able to exert a large amount of influence, and contribute to decisions that will determine the future of the product and the team.</li></ul><p>We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products.

Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects.

We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made.

It appears to be more thorough, personal, caring, and honest by far than any other I've seen. In my experience there are qualities present in a company's management that tend to permeate through all levels and find expression in many subtle ways. If I am reading into what I am seeing correctly then this would be an exceptional place to work. I'm not sure how to say it other than that. It was just kind of a feeling after looking over the page, that this is where I want to be.</p></blockquote><p>JF, 10/2018</p><blockquote><p>I'm extremely impressed with how much effort your organization puts into describing work opportunities! By far, this is the most helpful job posting I have ever seen. I intend to respond in a point-by-point fashion, as that seems to be the most efficient way to proceed. I hope to repay honesty with honesty.</p></blockquote><p>JH 8/2018:</p><blockquote><p>Like I mentioned before, I really like the whole interview process that you guys have.&nbsp; That in combination with how you guys responded to emails, etc. gave me a very positive impression of your company and I am still interested in working with you guys someday.</p></blockquote><p>LB, 8/2018</p><blockquote><p>The feedback I received from [your first skills assessment] was amazing!&nbsp; That was fantastic! I was really impressed with it.</p></blockquote><p>KM, 9/2018</p><blockquote><p>I just wanted to reach out and give you some really positive feedback. If I could go back in time and finish up those final interviews with you, I would do it in a heartbeat. I can already see a huge difference in personality between you and those who lead the company I joined -- and I think it speaks volumes. Keep being a great person!</p><p>I hope you found a great candidate in the end!</p></blockquote><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights.

We are not afraid to embrace new technologies, but are mindful in what we choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As an organization, we understand the importance of design, focusing on fundamental problems, and decentralizing decision making. As an engineering team, we design, build, and test with simplicity and scalability in mind. As individuals, we take ownership in our work and decisions.

Do animations, interactions, and user experiences delight you? Are you disciplined enough to work in sprints, but also mature enough to work independently?</p><p>Undefined LLC is hiring a full-time&nbsp;React / Node developer to work on customer-facing and internal websites and web applications. Say goodbye to the agency or freelance rat race - you’ll be working exclusively on a small number of company-led projects and initiatives.</p><p><strong>Our Projects</strong></p><p>So what types of projects will you be working on?</p><ul><li>A custom e-commerce site built in React and Next, powered on the back-end by Firebase and WordPress</li><li>A custom admin dashboard for a native app with more than 250,000 user accounts and 5,000 daily users, built in React and Next, and powered by Firebase</li><li>A shopify e-commerce site with a custom theme built on Shopify’s themekit and React</li><li>An app microsite built in React and Next, powered by Firebase</li><li>Various landing pages and microsites generally built in React and Next, powered by Firebase and/or WordPress as a CMS</li><li>Internal reporting and communication tools that may need some FED love</li></ul><p><strong>The Daily Grind</strong></p><p>What’s a typical day for an Undefined developer? We work in sprints; so, you’ll be in daily communication with your dev team members and leadership. But we also work like animals; so, you’ll be free to focus on getting your work done. Your week will begin with a Sprint Planning Meeting, you’ll have daily stand-ups during the week, and it will end on Friday with a Sprint Review.</p><p>Though most of your time during the week will be working on tasks and bugs, you’ll have the opportunity to step up regularly (if that’s your thing) and be involved in higher-level design and direction decisions. We say “if that’s your thing” because some people love that, others don’t. And we want you focused mostly on what you love.</p><p><strong>But What Am I Really Doing?</strong></p><p>Sometimes, you’ll have an entire Sketch design and you’ll be building out the FED. Other times, you’ll have the basic design requirements (fonts, colors, etc) and some functionality requirements (credit card form, shipping address), and you’ll design and build the page or component in browser. Or maybe you're writing a script to traverse Firestore to pull some data.</p><p>Hey - we just added some new functionality to how subscriptions are set up or we’re building out the functionality to export customer lists from our admin portal. You’ll FED those components, and also bug fix them should something break or not work as expected.</p><p><strong>Our Tech Stack</strong></p><p>You must know React and Firebase. We use React heavily in our front end development. You must also be great - not good, great - with CSS, SCSS, or some similar styling. We currently use SCSS modules in React, so you should be comfortable with SCSS even if you want to convince us that something better exists.</p><p>You must also have a great - not good, great - eye for CSS animations, timings, transitions...everything animated in the browser. If we (or you) get a crazy idea to animate a user interaction or drop in a little delighter, you’ll be the one to pull it off.</p><p>Experience with WordPress and/or Shopify is a plus.</p><p><strong>What You Need To Qualify</strong></p><p>This is a full-time position or contract-to-hire position depending on your situation and needs. To qualify:</p><ul><li>Must be a US citizen or resident alien</li><li>Proven work experience as a FED with React</li><li>Proficiency working in git and terminal</li><li>A portfolio and/or repo of actual work experience</li></ul><p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p><p>Send us your details - we need to see your work and resume or similar doc. We’ll reach out to qualified candidates via email to ask some questions or for a phone conversation.</p>            </div>        <div>            <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/328010?reset=False&amp;ra=1M0gQ5h9MW3K&amp;oqs=a%3D1M0gQ5h9MW3K%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>                                <span>Easy apply</span>            </a>                            </div>            <h4>About Undefined LLC</h4>            <div><p>Undefined's sole focus is to develop and scale our internal businesses.

We're not&nbsp;one of those as-seen-on-tv tech companies where everyone is playing ping pong or getting massages, but we're also not corporate overlords&nbsp;benchmarking lines of code per minute.</p><p>We operate with a few simple rules/thoughts:</p><ul><li>Act like an adult and you'll be treated like one</li><li>If you make a promise to a team member (or anyone), you'll&nbsp;see it through (even if that means working late or on the weekend - hey, you made the promise)</li><li>You'll never get in trouble for asking questions,&nbsp;but for doing something stupid because you didn't bother asking</li></ul><p>So yeah - that's how Undefined works.

This is a remote, full-time position.</p><p>CLIENT COMPANY DESCRIPTION:<br>The client operates a popular software for cannabis industry compliance. Is the fastest-growing Seed to Sale Cannabis tracking platform in the US. They help cannabis business owners by providing seamless integration with their California State reporting system to monitor inventory, prevent diversion, and collect taxes. About 1,000 cannabis operators currently use the product.<br><br>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:<br>The client needs to modernize and rebuild the frontend of a legacy AngularJS app in React/Redux in a very rapid/iterative fashion. The UX will not change a lot, but new, modern frontend technologies will be used. There are existing REST APIs (powered by ASP.Net v4) which can power much of functionality, and there will be dedicated backend developers available to improve APIs as necessary to ensure smooth/clear contracts between frontend and backend. The client is also considering wrapping the backend REST APIs in GraphQL so that the frontend code can use GraphQL queries as opposed to REST queries.<br><br>Your responsibility will be modernizing the frontend of the Application using React and Redux.<br><br>The client would really like to build the new frontend using TypeScript, but if they can't find developers quickly enough who know TypeScript, they may be open to using regular JavaScript.<br><br>They are currently using the Semantic UI frontend framework, but they are concerned with the long-term maintenance of that framework and are open to moving to Bootstrap or Material UI.<br><br>The entire React application will be deployed to Firebase as a static application (no server-side rendering needed).<br><br>The client is using Jira for project management and Git (Bitbucket) for source control.<br><br>RELATIONSHIPS - WHO YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH:<br>You'll be reporting to a Lead Engineer and working with two backend engineers, a designer, and a product owner. There is an existing daily meeting at 9:00 am America/Los Angeles (-07:00) PDT.<br><br>REQUIRED SKILLS:<br>- Excellent written and spoken English communication skills<br>- React<br>- Redux<br>- CSS<br>- Ability to move quickly to replicate an existing legacy project and work with the existing backend team<br>- Git<br><br>DESIRED (NICE-TO-HAVE) SKILLS:<br>- Experience with GraphQL (Apollo)<br>- TypeScript (Strongly preferred)<br>- Cypress.io test framework (or experience with similar end-to-end testing framework)<br>- Jira<br><br>START DATE:<br>As soon as possible.<br><br>EXPECTED CONTRACT DURATION:<br>This project will last anywhere from 2-4 months.<br><br>NOTES:<br>The client plans on hiring two frontend developers, so if you do not have experience with all the tools, you still may be selected for the project if your skills are complementary with the second developer's.<br><br></p><p>HOURLY RATE:</p><p>The pay rate for this role is from $40 - $60 USD per hour, depending on experience and capability.</p>            </div>        <div>        <a href='https://www.scalablepath.com/view-position/685d6821/react-redux-typescript-pro?pt[]=37110' rel='nofollow'>            Apply        </a>                            </div>            <h4>About Scalable Path</h4>            <div><p>Scalable Path is a group of visionary strategists and technologists, headquartered in San Francisco, with a network of top talent worldwide.

We love to contribute to the progress of agriculture. Our main cause is to support the farmer because in the end, it's all about mutual care and cooperation. Agriculture is our home and our origin and we speak from our own experience and know about the specific needs, which makes us the perfect partner for the agricultural trading of the next century. We want to push agriculture forward using state of the art technologies and we constantly stay in motion by taking one step at a time, being excited about everything that comes along. Working with us means to make a difference and to help us developing a meaningful product that in the end has an impact on the future of sustainable agriculture and thus the food you eat everyday.</p><p><strong><em><strong>What you should bring</strong></em></strong></p><ul><li>Great communication skills, ability to work in an agile team and workflow experience (git-flow, scrum, etc.)</li><li>4+ years proven JS work experience in a professional or institutional environment (including usage of node/npm/yarn)</li><li>Demonstrable experiences with Vue.js (or at least one out of the following: Backbone/Ember/Angular/React)</li><li>Demonstrated facility in a HTML/CSS/SASS/LESS environment</li><li>General understanding of core computer programming, distributed systems, logic &amp; cloud infrastructure as well as concepts like REST or GraphQL</li><li>Open-mindedness and an attitude that encourages nurturing your skills, learning new ones while at the same time passing on knowledge in areas you excel</li><li>Passion for writing quality, high-performance and maintainable code following best practices by heart</li><li>Farming experience (just joking but having played Farming Simulator does count)</li></ul><p><strong><strong>What to expect</strong></strong></p><p>As a Lead Front End Engineer at Agrando you will lead our team of frontend engineers in the creation of our main SPA frontend for the stakeholders on our trading platform (farmers, retailers, producers) as well as other products. You will make technologies or frameworks like Jest or TailwindCSS work for you. Most importantly, you will be responsible for our Front End architecture which is based on the latest JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Vuex, Axios as well as REST APIs and GraphQL. You will improve the UX and UI together with our Designers and guide them in their implementation efforts to align the product to their design philosophies. On the other hand, you will directly influence decisions supporting our DevOps, Analytics, Design and Product Department while keeping yourself in sync with the Sales &amp; Marketing team.</p><p>Since future logic is also driven by our data intensive infrastructure it is a plus if you want to get in touch with other parts of our product like our BI &amp; Big Data Pipeline (GCP) and Machine Learning strategies.

We encourage our employees to learn, teach and improve also through advanced trainings, workshops, (hosted) meetups or other external activities and provide them with the best resources (Books, Coachings &amp; Trainings, Udemy for Business, Nanodegrees from Udacity) for free.</li><li><strong>Additional Benefits:</strong> Weapons of choice (MBP etc.), Qualitrain (subsidized sports), Coffee &amp; Beer, Organic Fruits &amp; YumYum Soups, Switch &amp; XBOX360 Gaming</li></ul><p></p><p>If you are more motivated than others and you want to develop yourself further in an aspiring workplace environment, we are looking forward to receiving your application.

This is a remote, full-time position.</p><p>CLIENT COMPANY DESCRIPTION:<br>The client company is a membership organisation which provides country sports insurance and other benefits to members in the UK and Ireland. The company and its first club were established in 2008 and sister club was launched in 2017. They are looking to streamline the purchase process and improve overall user experience to encourage new members and maintain existing members. They also want to improve their search rankings by ensuring the new site is optimised to help potential customers find them, and relevant information about their products, quickly and easily.<br><br>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:<br>You will be tasked with developing two new websites from scratch (and potentially maintain them in the future)<br><br>Both websites are for clubs which require a membership database, members area with login, e-commerce and an admin control panel to manage memberships / purchases etc. There are various referral forms and a member’s benefits page which needs to have an interface for Trade Associates to upload details of special offers to members - this needs an approval system. There are lots more unique elements which require additional features for specific types of memberships/sales and, although functionality is broadly similar across the two sites, the second club also requires some extra functionality not required in the first.<br><br>Features they do not currently have and would like to introduce include optional recurring / automated renewal and payments, means to purchase multiple memberships in a single transaction, claims forms and claims management in the admin panel, ability to attach uploaded files to a member's record, ability to create custom reports and many more minor tweaks.<br><br>The current websites have been built (and built upon) by their in-house web developer. As the company has grown, requirements and systems have changed and the existing database and code is no longer fit for their purpose. They require a full structural review of the database and rebuilding from the ground up to ensure everything is fully cohesive. Existing membership data will need to be migrated into the new database and systems.<br><br>Once the new sites are finished and launched the client will require ongoing maintenance and updates.<br><br>RELATIONSHIPS - WHO YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH:<br>You will be reporting to the Managing Director and consulting with existing in house developer (and potentially another freelance developer) as needed. The client is in the Europe/London (+00:00) GMT time zone.<br><br>REQUIRED SKILLS:<br>- Strong English Communication<br>- PHP (Laravel or Symfony experience strongly preferred)<br>- JavaScript<br>- HTML<br>- CSS<br>- MySQL<br>- Server Configuration and Management in AWS<br>- Git<br><br>DESIRED (NICE-TO-HAVE) SKILLS:<br>- Experience with a modern JavaScript framework like React, Angular or Vue)<br>- Payment Gateway Integration experience<br><br>START DATE:<br>March 16, 2020<br><br>EXPECTED CONTRACT DURATION:<br>About 6 months but this is flexible. Ongoing maintenance thereafter.<br><br>NOTES:<br>The client is open to someone who can start part-time, but with a transition to full-time.</p><p>HOURLY RATE:</p><p>The pay rate for this role is from $30 to $50 USD per hour, depending on experience and capability.</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

Full-stack engineer</p><p>Our stack is React/Redux/TypeScript on the frontend, and Node/TypeScript on the backend. We're looking for an engineer who has experience with these technologies.</p><p>Our product primarily consists of a web UI on the frontend and a Monte-Carlo computation engine on the backend.

Do you have a passion for working with Product Managers to shape and deliver outstanding products for our customers?&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re Bloom &amp; Wild, the UK&rsquo;s most loved online florist. We&rsquo;re using technology to reimagine the experience of buying and receiving flowers, connecting people more thoughtfully to make sending flowers a joy to send and a delight to receive. In doing so we're aiming to become Europe&rsquo;s most loved flower brand. We&rsquo;ve raised over &pound;20million in venture capital funding and were recently named as the second-fastest growing tech company in the UK by Deloitte. One of the Tech Nation &ldquo;Future Fifty&rdquo; alumni and one of the Sunday Times Top 100 Small Companies to Work For 2020, we&rsquo;re now the fastest growing online flower company in Europe.</p><br /><p>Our business has, so far, been in the fortunate position to be able to continue trading and growing during this time of economic uncertainty, with the Government actively encouraging online retail, and customer demand for flowers for their loved ones is strong due to social distancing measures in place.</p><br /><p>This is a great opportunity for a Software Engineering Manager with people management experience to lead two cross functional engineering squads. You will report to Steve, our VP Engineering who is extremely passionate about people development and scaling teams. You&rsquo;ll get to shape both people and platforms to support our ambitious growth plans and take part in the next phase of our success.</p><br /><p>In Technology we're split into three squads with a fourth on the way. You'll start by leading the Growth squad, which focuses on driving profitable customer acquisition across all of our markets.&nbsp; This means helping to inspire our customers to understand, find, compare and select their perfect gift as well as working on improvements to our core checkout flow - delightfully expressing our brand to new customers and making it easy to order flowers.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll then play a leading part in the setup and day to day running of our new Expansion squad, with a mission to accelerate growth outside our UK core business. You&rsquo;ll work closely with our VP of Business Development as the squad works on solutions that build our international markets, develop new distribution channels and support the development of new products and services.</p><br /><p><strong>About you</strong></p><br /><p>Building diverse, happy, high performing squads will be a key part of what you do.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We believe strongly in giving our squads autonomy, while using cross team communities of practice and company wide OKRs to ensure alignment. You&rsquo;ll need to be comfortable working at pace, while fostering a mindset of continuous improvement within the squad, evolving and extending the agile, iterative approach to meet the squad&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll play a leading part in delivering the product and technology roadmap, and ensuring that customer needs are at the forefront of the squad members minds. We favour a collaborative, data-driven and experimental approach to solving complex problems, and expect our Engineering Managers to foster this mindset in their squads. You&rsquo;ll ensure that there is a focus on scrum mastery within your squad, either by playing the role yourself or empowering a squad member to assist you.</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll work closely with other Engineering Managers, VP Engineering and community of practice leads to shape the technology roadmap and strategy going forwards, ensuring that we are improving the whole team and optimising the approach for more than just your squad.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Ideally your background will be in frontend development and this will enable you to help your squad interpret requirements into something they can deliver as you work with them to find the right technical approach. Working with our VP Engineering and Technology Leadership team, you&rsquo;ll help to solve our top priority problems for the quarter from a technology and people perspective.</p><br /><p>As an experienced people manager you&rsquo;ll take responsibility for performance management, career progression, pastoral care and everything else that means that you have a happy and motivated squad. The team environment that you create will promote both autonomy and accountability. You&rsquo;ll be a great coach and servant leader, able to motivate and guide the squad through the good times and the bad, learning and improving as you go.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We care about creating a diverse and inclusive team - it's what helps us generate the best ideas and grow faster. We want to make giving and receiving gifts a joy for everyone, and to do this we need people from all backgrounds, with different perspectives and ideas. We welcome anyone to apply, with the knowledge that you&rsquo;ll have the freedom to give your opinion, do your best work and be part of a genuinely inclusive, friendly and caring team.</p><br /><p><strong>Our tech</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll also get to work with some great technology. Our stack consists of iOS and Android apps, an Angular 7 website and backend platform in Ruby on Rails. We encourage our developers to be full stack and our squads to own their code from their local machine into usage in production. We&rsquo;re focusing heavily on increasing our usage of machine learning and automation of our business processes so we can continue to scale at pace.

By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.\\n\\nWe are a socially conscious, distributed team. We give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living where you’re most comfortable and working in areas where you can help foster and grow the community that you are a part of.\\n\\nWe believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth. As one of our first front-end developers, your decisions will have an outsized influence on the future of our product.&nbsp; You’ll take input from product, design, and customers and then you’ll collaborate with other experienced, passionate engineering team to build the frameworks and features that will support our customers now, and in the future.\\n\\nSigns of a great candidate\\n\\n\\n* Collaborative.&nbsp;You know that your colleagues’ perspectives will make our customers successful. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together. You propose ways for us to be more engaged and successful with our customers.\\n\\n* Customer focused. Our customers are at the forefront of your day.&nbsp; You prioritize our customers’ voice to ensure their needs are met.&nbsp;\\n\\n* Ambitious, curious, and resourceful.&nbsp;You are innately curious, and you aren’t afraid to work hard. You are self driven, you take direction well but are able to be creative to find results on your own when asked. You are driven to succeed because your hard work and results make you proud.\\n\\n* Disciplined and reliable.&nbsp; We are a distributed company and you enjoy the benefits of working distributed while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.\\n\\n* Appreciative of honest feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.\\n\\n* Work smarter and harder.&nbsp;You often identify a problem, create a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own.&nbsp; You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCrisp's Frontend Tech Stack&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* Statically typed, modern languages.&nbsp;We use TypeScript and React for the UI, and GraphQL with Apollo to communicate with our backend.&nbsp; Knowledge of these specific technologies is not a requirement. If you’re willing to learn, we’re willing to help you along the way.\\n\\n* Continuous deployment.&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.\\n\\n* Micro-services.&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.\\n\\n* Start-up mode.&nbsp; The team is still small, and the product is fresh.&nbsp; You’ll be able to exert a large amount of influence, and contribute to decisions that will determine the future of the product and the team.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific background, experience or geographical location. Instead we’re looking for individuals that are capable, reliable, and hoping to grow along with us. Do you have strengths you can share? If so, we’d love to hear from you!  </div> </div>",

This is a remote, full-time position.\\n\\nCLIENT COMPANY DESCRIPTION:\\nThe client operates a popular software for cannabis industry compliance. Is the fastest-growing Seed to Sale Cannabis tracking platform in the US. They help cannabis business owners by providing seamless integration with their California State reporting system to monitor inventory, prevent diversion, and collect taxes. About 1,000 cannabis operators currently use the product.\\n\\nDUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:\\nThe client needs to modernize and rebuild the frontend of a legacy AngularJS app in React/Redux in a very rapid/iterative fashion. The UX will not change a lot, but new, modern frontend technologies will be used. There are existing REST APIs (powered by ASP.Net v4) which can power much of functionality, and there will be dedicated backend developers available to improve APIs as necessary to ensure smooth/clear contracts between frontend and backend. The client is also considering wrapping the backend REST APIs in GraphQL so that the frontend code can use GraphQL queries as opposed to REST queries.\\n\\nYour responsibility will be modernizing the frontend of the Application using React and Redux.\\n\\nThe client would really like to build the new frontend using TypeScript, but if they can't find developers quickly enough who know TypeScript, they may be open to using regular JavaScript.\\n\\nThey are currently using the Semantic UI frontend framework, but they are concerned with the long-term maintenance of that framework and are open to moving to Bootstrap or Material UI.\\n\\nThe entire React application will be deployed to Firebase as a static application (no server-side rendering needed).\\n\\nThe client is using Jira for project management and Git (Bitbucket) for source control.\\n\\nRELATIONSHIPS - WHO YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH:\\nYou'll be reporting to a Lead Engineer and working with two backend engineers, a designer, and a product owner. There is an existing daily meeting at 9:00 am America/Los Angeles (-07:00) PDT.\\n\\nREQUIRED SKILLS:\\n- Excellent written and spoken English communication skills\\n- React\\n- Redux\\n- CSS\\n- Ability to move quickly to replicate an existing legacy project and work with the existing backend team\\n- Git\\n\\nDESIRED (NICE-TO-HAVE) SKILLS:\\n- Experience with GraphQL (Apollo)\\n- TypeScript (Strongly preferred)\\n- Cypress.io test framework (or experience with similar end-to-end testing framework)\\n- Jira\\n\\nSTART DATE:\\nAs soon as possible.\\n\\nEXPECTED CONTRACT DURATION:\\nThis project will last anywhere from 2-4 months.\\n\\nNOTES:\\nThe client plans on hiring two frontend developers, so if you do not have experience with all the tools, you still may be selected for the project if your skills are complementary with the second developer's.\\n\\n\\n\\nHOURLY RATE:\\n\\nThe pay rate for this role is from $60 - $140 USD per hour, depending on experience and capability.  </div> </div>",

The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry.

We expect high attention-to-detail, whether it's in how we write an email, review our analytics, or design the site. We delight in getting the details right, even in internal documents. High attention to detail isn’t something you turn on and off — it’s an attitude.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Always look to improve:</strong>&nbsp;We survive and grow by constantly looking for opportunities to improve our solutions, our processes and ourselves. We own our mistakes, using them as an opportunity to learn what changes we should make to processes and tools. We expect our people to proactively look for opportunities to develop and improve our own performance.</li><li><strong>Enjoy the journey:&nbsp;</strong>We consider our health and families to be more important than work. We ensure no-one feels that they are frequently required to work excessive hours. We support each other in overcoming problems and achieving work and life goals. We’re positive and enthusiastic — helping everyone feel energized to take us to the next level. We don’t pin our happiness on the attainment of a particular end goal - we delight in every step along the way.</li></ol><p>We don’t just ‘say’ these are our values.

We’ve built:</p><ul><li><strong>A user-created library of templated docs</strong>, so you never have to start from scratch</li><li><strong>Workspaces&nbsp;</strong>that bring your team together in a single home for your work</li><li><strong>Powerful search</strong>&nbsp;that gets you to the right doc, every time</li><li><strong>Linked document versions</strong>, so you can merge or update multiple docs in one tap</li><li><strong>Approvals</strong>&nbsp;to keep your team aligned and on track through complex workflows</li></ul><p>We've seen professionals waste too much time managing information across disorganized documents instead of doing meaningful work. We believe this problem isn’t rooted in a lack of knowledge in the world, but in the deficiencies of tools we rely on to access, share, and improve how work gets done.</p><p>We’ve been moving fast since we founded Almanac in January 2019. Almanac is now used by over 4000 teams and sees over 50,000 visitors per month to its public Core of knowledge.

We are a team of multinational people with various domain of expertise ranging from business, to data science, to logistics, to software development, to finance… A nice blend of domain and technology expertise.</p><p><strong>CEL is putting together a full product team to create a ground breaking Simulation As A Service offer that will deeply impact the supply chain industry.</strong></p><p><em>Why is Supply Chain important?</em></p><p>Take a second and look around you - everything you see has came to you through a supply chain, starting from a natural resource into your home through hundreds of activities more or less coordinated so you have what you want when you want.</p><p>So Supply Chain is everything of the physical world. Without supply chains, there are no businesses, no jobs, no buildings, no economy, nothing.</p><p>So we think that it’s kind of important.</p><p>After 15 years of working with hundred of companies that make and distribute their products (from milk to shoes, from furniture to cement, from electronics to vegetables….) we have came to a simple conclusion: it is too complex for people to operate properly. Current IT system, organisation, processes actually don’t help much. All these networks of flows are inherently inefficient.</p><p>Why? Complexity. No human brain is capable to comprehend the actual dynamics of such complex systems. No IT tool, no ERP, no fancy solution is actually taking a holistic view of the problem, instead each of these focus on improving small pieces.</p><p>The result? massive wastes of resources, enormous amount of inventory, unnecessary impact on the environment… and ultimately rare are the cases when supply actually meets demand, creating massive systemic effect and rather low customer satisfaction. Pure waste.</p><p>So we decided to really do something about it.</p><p>We are currently developing a product that that combines technologies like Data Science, Simulation Modelling, Cloud computing - backed up with years of business experience - to help companies actually assess what their future could look like and figure out what alternatives exist.</p><p>To replace the common approach of guessing what could happen, we are aiming at answering “What if” questions in an easy, sexy and fast manner.</p><p>Imagine you could simulate various scenario of your own future, would your life decisions be better?

Our stack includes React, React Native, Electron, GCS, AWS, C#, and Java. We don't expect experience with all of these, but we do expect you to be able to learn quickly and pick up what you need to know. The majority of work will be in React.</p><p>You'll be working with a great distributed engineering team with a history of working with large-scale web applications.

But we're always looking for ways to improve. People rarely work more than 40 hrs/wk and we spend&nbsp;0% of our time fighting fires.</p><p>There's no babysitting. You're in charge of yourself. That means you work where and when you want.</p><p>Culture is really important to us. But building culture in a remote team can be difficult. We do a lot of things to try to remedy that. Chief among them are our annual retreats. Last year our retreat was in Lisbon, Portugal. We had a hackathon, broke out of escape rooms, and ate lots of good food.</p><p>There's always something challenging to work and great people to spend your days with building things at Hubstaff.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible schedule</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote / Work from home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Job security / Long term</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 72 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>            </div>        <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>            Apply        </a>                            </div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives.

We are a team of multinational people with various domain of expertise ranging from business, to data science, to logistics, to software development, to finance… A nice blend of domain and technology expertise.</p><p><strong>CEL is putting together a full product team to create a ground breaking Simulation As A Service offer that will deeply impact the supply chain industry.</strong></p><p><em>Why is Supply Chain important?</em></p><p>Take a second and look around you - everything you see has came to you through a supply chain, starting from a natural resource into your home through hundreds of activities more or less coordinated so you have what you want when you want.</p><p>So Supply Chain is everything of the physical world. Without supply chains, there are no businesses, no jobs, no buildings, no economy, nothing.</p><p>So we think that it’s kind of important.</p><p>After 15 years of working with hundred of companies that make and distribute their products (from milk to shoes, from furniture to cement, from electronics to vegetables….) we have came to a simple conclusion: it is too complex for people to operate properly. Current IT system, organisation, processes actually don’t help much. All these networks of flows are inherently inefficient.</p><p>Why? Complexity. No human brain is capable to comprehend the actual dynamics of such complex systems. No IT tool, no ERP, no fancy solution is actually taking a holistic view of the problem, instead each of these focus on improving small pieces.</p><p>The result? massive wastes of resources, enormous amount of inventory, unnecessary impact on the environment… and ultimately rare are the cases when supply actually meets demand, creating massive systemic effect and rather low customer satisfaction. Pure waste.</p><p>So we decided to really do something about it.</p><p>We are currently developing a product that that combines technologies like Data Science, Simulation Modelling, Cloud computing - backed up with years of business experience - to help companies actually assess what their future could look like and figure out what alternatives exist.</p><p>To replace the common approach of guessing what could happen, we are aiming at answering “What if” questions in an easy, sexy and fast manner.</p><p>Imagine you could simulate various scenario of your own future, would your life decisions be better? Most likely!</p><p>If the challenge is of interest to you, if you are keen to understand how product-driven businesses actually works, if you are willing to make full use of your systemic thinking and bridge the gap between the physical and virtual world, and if you have the competencies we are after, then we may pretty much want to work together to change the world!</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shares and revenu shares</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full remote possible</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team trips to Vietnam (head office)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly team retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Cross field product with a huge disruption potential</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
