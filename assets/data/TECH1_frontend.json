Our mission is to make them more open and fair, driving new economic opportunities and putting people in control of their digital lives.</p><p>To start we've built the <a href='https://www.argent.xyz/' rel='nofollow'>first crypto wallet</a> with the simplicity and security of the best new bank apps - yet we never hold users’ assets. It takes the complexity out of Ethereum and is driven by our dedication to user experience.</p><p>We launched in 2018 and have a world-class team with experience scaling mobile apps to tens of millions of users. Our eclectic backgrounds include PhDs in nuclear physics and quantum cryptography. We’re fortunate to be backed by the top VCs in Europe, including <a href='https://www.indexventures.com/' rel='nofollow'>Index Ventures</a>, <a href='https://www.creandum.com/' rel='nofollow'>Creandum</a> and <a href='https://www.firstminute.capital/' rel='nofollow'>firstminute capital</a>.</p><h4> The Senior Javascript Engineer role </h4><p>You'll lead the development of several important areas:</p><p>First, the Argent Security Center. A core part of the Argent experience, this web application helps to secure our users' data. It's a customer facing React app that interacts with the Ethereum blockchain and our own backend services.</p><p>Second, the Argent Javascript SDK. You'll develop, publish and maintain this product. This is a vital part of how we'll help millions of people access a new, decentralized internet.</p><p>Third, out Internal Dashboard. We have an internal view to help solve customer issues and keep our engineering team happy when debugging (also in React).</p><p>You'll have extensive experience building and maintaining web products and be fluent in JavaScript. Ideally you'll also have some experience of Ethereum JS libraries. In the role you'll work closely with the founders and a small team of highly skilled and experienced engineers and designers.</p><h4> Requirements </h4><ul><li>5+ years experience with building and maintaining web products</li><li>Fluent in JavaScript/Typescript and its functional style</li><li>Solid understanding of Javascript frameworks such as React/Vue</li><li>Experience with Ethereum JS libraries (web3js, ethers.js, ...)</li><li>Experience with Node.js</li><li>Fluency in written and spoken English</li></ul><h4> How we work </h4><p>We work remotely, transparently and balance Argent with the rest of our lives. We’ve all got loved ones with unpredictable schedules, be they kids or cats.</p><p>Although we’re a distributed team you'll need to be based in the UK or Europe. This is because we find communication much easier when we’re in similar time zones and a short flight away. Within Europe you can choose to work wherever you like!</p><p>We get together for a week every quarter so we can collaborate in person, explore new solutions, and have fun. So far we’ve been to Nice, Toulouse, Brussels, Lisbon and Barcelona.</p><h4> Equal opportunities </h4><p>At the heart of what we do is making crypto accessible to everyone. We want the team itself to reflect that diversity so we’d strongly encourage applications from underrepresented demographics.</p>",

This offers researchers/R&amp;D professionals, and their corresponding organisations (ie. pharmas), a highly scalable, modular and reproducible system that automates the analysis processes, learns from the data and provides actionable insights.<br /><br />Our tech team is split into:<br />1. Engineering and Machine Learning:<br />&bull; Stack: Node JS, React, MongoDB<br />&bull; Building Lifebit&rsquo;s platform.<br /><br />2. Bioinformatics and Genomics:<br />&bull; Building Lifebit&rsquo;s genomics modules: end-to-end solutions for specific operations and analysis.<br /><br /><br />We are hiring an experienced Backend Engineer with at least 3 years of experience in the role, to help us grow the team in a scalable and sustainable way.<br /><br />Requirements, knowledge and experience:<br />&bull; Quality process and automation.<br />&bull; Scalable and optimisation of backends.<br />&bull; Server availability, security, backups.<br />&bull; Scalability in architectures and databases.<br />&bull; Big data technologies and platforms.<br />&bull; Leverage of open source solutions.<br />&bull; Designing and delivery of large scale applications.<br />&bull; High availability architectures, load balancing, fault-tolerance, virtualisation and cloud computing.<br /><br />&bull; NoSQL databases, especially MongoDB.<br />&bull; REST APIs and web services.<br />&bull; Advanced JS.<br />&bull; Experience with React, Redux, D3, and latest JS visualisation frameworks.<br />&bull; Experience with cloud platform (AWS, Azure,...).<br /><br />&bull; Having worked in startups, especially valuable if these scaled significantly, and fast-paced environments.<br /><br />Job type:<br />&bull; Full-time<br /><br />Job Location:<br />&bull; London, we don&rsquo;t allow fully remote but are open to some flexibility. If you&rsquo;re based in Cambridge, for example, we&rsquo;d cover your commute to London and after the initial on-boarding period, we&rsquo;d be happy to explore being at the office for just 3 days/week.<br /><br /><br />_____________________________<br /><br />More about the team:<br /><br />Lifebit&rsquo;s founding team has over 30 years of combined experience in the field - they know first-hand what the need is and how to build the right technological solution to address its pain-points. Prior to founding Lifebit, they worked on building the programming language that is predominantly used in the genomics world to develop applications that are faster and better at analysing DNA data - Nextflow (<a href='https://www.nextflow.io/' target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel='noopener noreferrer'>nextflow.io</a>) published on Nature Biotechnology.<br /><br />Nextflow&rsquo;s quick and overreaching adoption shows the urgent need the industry faces for a solution that addresses the increasing computational and big data challenges related to any genomics analysis.<br /><br />All above requirements and specs are just an indication of what we&rsquo;re looking for. However, sometimes the perfect person is far more or less experienced than we anticipated. If you think that might be the case, please apply and just let us know.</p>",

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\\n\\nWe take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.\\n\\nOur current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic. We don’t expect you to have experience with everything on this list, and we’ll help you learn what you don’t know!\\n\\nAs a front-end engineer at Olo, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us build one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the hospitality industry.

More in the posting.\\n\\nTechnologies\\n\\nangularjs ruby vue.js react angular\\n\\nJob description\\n\\nAre you a versatile developer (frontend and backend) with a touch of UX designer who is obsessive about creating thoughtful software that improves someone’s day? If so, we’d love to chat with you about adding some firepower to our senior product team -- a team who is actively helping women’s health providers spend more quality time with patients by fundamentally re-imagining their daily digital workflows. &nbsp;\\n\\n***&nbsp;\\nUpdate on 'Location' : So, while we do have the 'remote' flag on, we're *ideally*&nbsp;looking for someone in the Richmond, VA&nbsp;area-ish (think: 2 hour train ride, so DC to Raleigh to Charlottesville); however, we could live with the NE corridor-ish (think: &lt;2 hour flight; our VP Engineering is near Boston), too.&nbsp;Our CEO works in an office in Arlington, VA, if you want to keep him company. Or, put another way: are you available to be in the Richmond, VA&nbsp;virtual office once every month-ish? Yeah, That'd be greaaaaaat... Don't forget the cover page on those TPS reports either.\\n****\\n\\nIdeally you are as eager and passionate as we are about:\\n\\n\\n* Crafting thoughtful user experiences that help people (in our case doctors, nurses, and medical assistants) make the best decisions possible while removing tedious BS from their daily workflow.\\n\\n\\n\\n* reducing the large amount of time that clinicians spend on documenting what they have already done (go ahead -- ask your doctor about how much they like their EHR (electronic health record) next time you’re sick)\\n\\n\\n\\n* re-imagining not only the traditional user experiences &amp; workflow of EHRs, but also the medium through which the latest medical best practices can be actionably and seamlessly incorporated into delivering care.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOK, you may not be super-passionate about these things right now (let’s face it -- medical workflows and “EHRs” sound pretty boring on paper), but you will be. Why? Because you’ll be building software that fixes INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATING experiences for doctors. &nbsp;And it’s incredibly satisfying to modernize, replace &amp; improve outdated, problematic software. &nbsp;It’s important. And you’ll be loved/adored for it. &nbsp;(And once you see the way this stuff is currently done, you’ll be left scratching your head or otherwise disappointed)\\n\\nA little about us...\\n\\nWe’re a small-but-mighty with funding and&nbsp;a strategic partnership with the most influential voice in women’s health: the American College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynecologists (ACOG).\\n\\nOur mission is to remove the digital roadblocks that interfere with healthcare providers’ ability to spend quality time with patients (Oh, and we try to help them make better decisions along the way as well).\\n\\n...A Lot About You\\n\\nIdeally, you are a multitalented wunderkind who runs circles around each of the below bullet points, but let’s be real: while some of these are must-have, many are wish-list. &nbsp;We may have gotten a bit carried away with these, so if feel your unique combination of skills is close-ish to the mark, don’t hesitate to reach out. In fact, do so enthusiastically.\\n\\n\\n* ...you’re a software craftsperson with a roll-up-your-sleeves mentality -- there’s a lot of thoughtful, nuanced, nitty gritty work to get done.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* … you have “X years of experience” &nbsp;Pshaw. We aren’t big on formal requirements in the credentials department; rather, we want to see what you’ve worked on. &nbsp;Show us a project you’re proud of that you shipped and we’ll start the conversation from there. But let’s not kid ourselves -- you should absolutely come without training wheels.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* ... you are comfortable shifting gears between front-end Javascript and back-end Ruby-on-Rails when you need to… We have some folks who are stronger on the front end and some folks who are stronger on the back end. &nbsp;Our ideal is&nbsp;someone who&nbsp;has excellent design sensibilities and a firm grasp of HTML5 / CSS / SASS, ui toolkits like bootstrap, but also can talk about and implement good APIs to talk to the front end and also write code to connect to other APIs from our backend. &nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* … you’re pretty opinionated about your design choices and can easily articulate/defend your design decisions/rationale when asked “Why did you &lt;insert observation that challenges your design choice&gt;?”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* … you have solid AngularJS front-end development chops. &nbsp;But, because you love javascript frameworks in general, you’ve played around with -- and probably are opinionated about -- other frameworks like Angular(7), React, and Vue.js.\\n\\n\\n\\n* ... you have solid&nbsp;Ruby on Rails development jobs., &nbsp;Or, because you love software development in general, you're not worried about picking it up because you have other back-end experience that translates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* ...you should be able to design, architect &amp; implement solutions that reflect your particular problem-solving approach (...and you’ll probably be solving a problem that was based on a story that you yourself were instrumental in either eliciting or refining).\\n\\n\\n\\n* … you’re a natural Design Thinker. &nbsp;Therefore, you’re good at leveraging your empathy to investigate both known and ambiguous aspects of a complex, convoluted story (lots of these in healthcare!) in order to discover hidden parameters and open alternative paths which may lead to the real story. &nbsp;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* … &nbsp;you have an admirable understanding of the principles behind a good* RESTful API design. &nbsp;(*But also know enough to not let perfect get in the way of the good)\\n\\n\\n\\n* … you’re comfortable/knowledgeable with git. &nbsp;CI experience a bonus, but not required.\\n\\n\\n\\n* … you’ve worked at startups before or have always been looking for an excuse to.\\n\\n\\n\\n* … you work well in a loosely structured PM/Managerial environment (we’re agile with a “little a”)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUs + You?\\n\\nAs the newest member our product team, you’ll be an integral part of every aspect of our business strategy, dev roadmap, technology architecture decisions, and, undoubtedly, will wear a lot of hats. &nbsp;\\n\\nOnes of these hats -- in addition to your techie/design hats -- will almost certainly be the Customer Hat. At Dorsata, we are fervent (rabidly obsessive, really) believers in frequent, high-touch interactions with our involved, loyal customer base, who drives our roadmap. &nbsp;As we've grown, developers are often removed from the day-to-day, but you should be the type of person who is able to empathize and ask good questions of customers.\\n\\nObligatory message: &nbsp;If you're a third-party recruiter who is looking to send us resumes, please don't. We don't accept resumes from third-party recruiters. No, we're not interested in how Yet Another Recruiting company&nbsp;can help us make the world a better place, etc.; we already know good people who do that when we need to. (We're amazed at the number of random LinkedIn messages from recruiters we see, both on the hiring and job seeking side. Yes, you're great human beings, but please move along.)\\n\\nAbout Dorsata\\n\\nDorsata’s clinical workflow intelligence platform is designed to work both top of and inside of the existing electronic health records (EHRs) that our customers use. The ACOG Prenatal Record -- our flagship product for the Dorsata platform -- is an AngularJS/Rails SPA designed collaboratively with women’s health providers to support the way that they work &amp; think -- not tell them how to work &amp; think (or add additional clerical burdens to their already-busy day). We want practitioners of women’s health to feel like they are using a piece of software not only designed for them, but by them. &nbsp;\\n\\nMore About Us :\\n\\nHow We Interview &amp; Hire\\n\\nLike many of the other startups you are currently perusing on stackoverflow/angellist/hired/vettery/reddit/linkedIn/etc., our interview process begins with an intro call to help you learn more about the role, for us to hear more about you, and to help the two of us decide if Dorsata is a mutual fit. If we move forward, the next step will be a more in depth call with us that dives into some problem solving about healthcare. &nbsp;Based on that problem solving exercise, we do a quick real-world based coding test to make sure you actually do know AngularJS (or React or Vue or AngularX) / what a computer is.\\n\\nWe're small, so we also like to have people talk to our CEO.\\n\\nBenefits / Perks / Comp\\n\\n\\n* Health Insurance / Dental\\n\\n* Market salary + equity participation opportunity\\n\\n* We are remote first, though we do have some space in Arlington, VA. &nbsp;If you like, go&nbsp;for an occasional stints in Antarctica, though we operate on the East Coast timezone and get together every 6 weeks in person. &nbsp;Also, Antartica is cold.\\n\\n* Fun, friendly &amp; delightfully BS-free work environment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoel Test\\n\\nSource control One-step build Daily builds Bug database Bugs fixed before writing new code Up-to-date schedule Specs Quiet working conditions Best tools that money can buy Testers Code screening Hallway usability testing  </div> </div>",

In this role you’ll be helping to shape their digital products by working closely with their design team to deliver high quality transactional applications across multiple devices, as well as building highly transactional microservices to support their architecture. Key to the company’s success is the ability to build effective UX that is supported by performant APIs – you’ll have a pivotal role in making this a reality, working across a pure JavaScript stack.</p><p>They’re looking for someone who has solid experience with React (plus associated libraries) and OO JavaScript/ES6. You’ll have previous experience working with microservices architecture as well as Node.JS (again, plus associated build tools – think Yarn, Babel etc.). They’re huge fans of GraphQL so hopefully you are too! Then there’s your more generic skills:</p><ul><li>HTML5/CSS3 (SASS etc.)</li><li>Experience delivering cross browser responsive websites/apps (including isomorphic ones)</li><li>Unit testing/integration testing/BDD/TDD</li><li>Cloud hosting experience on AWS</li></ul><p>Bonus points for prior experience working on high traffic e-commerce websites or if you’re an active contributor to open source projects!</p><p>As well as the requirements in the opening paragraph they’re looking for someone who’s keen to contribute to, and assist the Solution Architect with technical solution design and a roadmap; ensuring this is followed by the dev team. Again, there’s also your more generic expectations:</p><ul><li>Mentor junior developers</li><li>Engage and contribute to story workshops</li><li>Refactoring pages as required</li><li>Ensuring all code is delivered from the BDD processes</li></ul><p>In return they’re offering a salary of up to £70K (though I’m sure there can be flex here) as well as some fantastic benefits, the best of which is an outstanding pension scheme and a substantial discount on travel fares. They’re also HUGE fans of flexible and remote working.</p><p></p>                                                <div>                            <a href='https://www.jobg8.com/Traffic.aspx?gF5uTLP27Fp12n%2fqlfMZqAq' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>                    </div>                                    </div>",

Expect to travel at least two times a year: once for our all-hands meetup and again for a team retreat (each ~4-5 days).</li><li>We believe in a focused approach to collaboration, where individual team members work on a single top priority at a time, each supporting larger, company-wide objectives. This philosophy serves to impact our vision to raise the standard of trust online.</li><li>Our work philosophy centers on empowered project management.

We felt a little bit impersonal just throwing you right in there with words like “revolutionizing” and “disrupting”.\\n\\nAs such, we want you to know that the person that wrote this job description apologises in advance for any clichés, tropes or sudden-insecurity-driven-panic-attacks that you might find in the description below.\\n\\nWhat Is Impala Now?\\n\\nImpala makes building travel software incredibly easy. We provide hotels with a powerful data management platform that makes connecting to software, hardware and room distributors extremely easy.&nbsp;Think Twilio for Travel.\\n\\nWe launched in January 2019 and since then have grown at - quite frankly - a ridiculous old clip. Our technology is already installed in hundreds of hotels worldwide, on six continents and categorises more than 1 billion data points.\\n\\nWe are a team 14 exceptional people split across engineering, product and commercial that have built a fantastic community.\\n\\nWhere Is Impala Going?\\n\\nWe’re supported by some of the best investors in the business, the early stage backers behind Deliveroo, PillPack, SecretEscapes, Zoopla, Trivago and more. They’re on board because of our vision - revolutionizing a $1.6 trillion dollar market that’s been out-of-date for 20 years.\\n\\nWithin the next two years, 25% of hotel bookings worldwide will flow through Impala technology and the product that we’re building will support the entire ecosystem of travel technology (we already have over a thousand companies signed up).\\n\\nAnyone travelling anywhere will interact with products powered by Impala and to achieve this we’re growing the team to 50 people within the next year.\\n\\nWhat Will I Be Doing?\\n\\nBrace yourself for some bullet points:\\n\\n\\n* You’ll initially&nbsp;work across our agile teams&nbsp;as a frontend engineering resource before becoming a dedicated member of one of the teams.\\n\\n* You’ll&nbsp;add features to our existing UIs and also create new UI products&nbsp;that allow our technology partners and their hotels to better manage their applications and data.\\n\\n* You’ll&nbsp;improve the security features&nbsp;across all of our frontend products.\\n\\n* You’ll&nbsp;add functionality to our internal tools&nbsp;that allows our support team to better service customers.\\n\\n* You’ll&nbsp;analyze and optimise (be that UX, performance, security) new and existing features&nbsp;to continually improve our products.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Sort of Person Are You Looking For?\\n\\n\\n* Someone with&nbsp;significant React experience&nbsp;and good knowledge of JS fundamentals\\n\\n* Someone&nbsp;comfortable working closely with product owners, designers, UX experts and the ability to translate their designs/requirements into maintainable, componentised UIs.\\n\\n* Someone that is&nbsp;extremely collaborative, Impala’s engineering team is not political, everyone has great ideas and should be open to input. We have no space for brilliant jerks.\\n\\n* Someone who is&nbsp;passionate about customer experience&nbsp;and building high quality maintainable software that looks and works fantastically.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere Will I Work?\\n\\nThis is a remote position (all of our engineering team and some of our other staff members are distributed). This means you can work from anywhere +/- 2 Hours of London, timezone wise (and less than a 3 hour flight). As part of that:\\n\\n\\n* We offer an office stipend (you can furnish a home office or choose a coworking space near you).\\n\\n* We give you an additional significant start-up equipment budget for things like monitors, keyboards, headphones etc.\\n\\n* You’ll travel once a quarter to meet the rest of the engineering team somewhere in Europe.\\n\\n* You’ll have a budget to travel to team socials if you’d like to meet everyone in person more frequently.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease note,&nbsp;we only accept candidates in Western Europe because of timezone and travel time differences. We make no exceptions (we don’t have time to!).\\n\\nWhat Do You Offer In Return?\\n\\nAs a member of the Impala team, you’ll have access to:\\n\\n\\n* Working with some of the best and brightest&nbsp;minds in their field, helping you to achieve the best that you can.\\n\\n* A culture that celebrates success, reliability and building a great community.\\n\\n* A top of market salary. If you’re truly great, we’ll pay what we need to.\\n\\n* Equity in an honest-to-god-could-buy-a-yacht-later&nbsp;company. Travel is a huge industry and infrastructure is a huge part of that.\\n\\n* A minimum of 36 days paid holiday per year.&nbsp;Unlimited holiday means you never take it, we just decided to give you a lot.\\n\\n* A professional development budget.&nbsp;That we make sure you spend with frequent PD sessions.\\n\\n* Generous maternity and paternity leave.\\n\\n* Health and wellbeing scheme.&nbsp;Including access to Headscape, Meditation/Stress management, Massage Lottery, Health Food Voucher etc.\\n\\n* A bunch of great benefits, like private health insurance, cheaper gym membership, cycle-to-work scheme, an everlasting friendship with the author of this post, annual “un-sick” day and many more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore About Impala\\n\\nIf you’re really, really, really,&nbsp;really&nbsp;excited to learn more then please check out our&nbsp;Medium page&nbsp;which includes more information about who we are, what we do and our culture.\\n\\nFor more information on what it's like working here, check out our&nbsp;Glassdoor page.\\n\\nYou can also check out getimpala.com for more information about what we’re doing.  </div> </div>",

They’re on board because of our vision - revolutionizing a $1.6 trillion dollar market that’s been out-of-date for 20 years.</p><p>Within the next two years, 25% of hotel bookings worldwide will flow through Impala technology and the product that we’re building will support the entire ecosystem of travel technology (we already have over a thousand companies signed up).</p><p>Anyone travelling anywhere will interact with products powered by Impala and to achieve this we’re growing the team to 50 people within the next year.</p><p><strong>What Will I Be Doing?</strong></p><p>Brace yourself for some bullet points:</p><ul><li>You’ll initially<strong>&nbsp;work across our agile teams</strong>&nbsp;as a frontend engineering resource before becoming a dedicated member of one of the teams.</li><li>You’ll&nbsp;<strong>add features to our existing UIs and also create new UI products</strong>&nbsp;that allow our technology partners and their hotels to better manage their applications and data.</li><li>You’ll&nbsp;<strong>improve the security features</strong>&nbsp;across all of our frontend products.</li><li>You’ll&nbsp;<strong>add functionality to our internal tools</strong>&nbsp;that allows our support team to better service customers.</li><li>You’ll&nbsp;<strong>analyze and optimise (be that UX, performance, security) new and existing features</strong>&nbsp;to continually improve our products.</li></ul><p><strong>What Sort of Person Are You Looking For?</strong></p><ul><li>Someone with&nbsp;<strong>significant React experience</strong>&nbsp;and good knowledge of JS fundamentals</li><li>Someone&nbsp;<strong>comfortable working closely with product owners, designers</strong>, UX experts and the ability to translate their designs/requirements into maintainable, componentised UIs.</li><li>Someone that is&nbsp;<strong>extremely collaborative</strong>, Impala’s engineering team is not political, everyone has great ideas and should be open to input.

We’re not just doing reporting - our product is an end-to-end retail analytics stack.

Therapists (physios, sports therapists etc) are trained to treat not run so need support to reach their business and clinical goals. Equally, as it’s such a confusing market the average member of the public sees three of more therapists before they find the right one costing them a lot of time money and frustration.</p><p>With increasing NHS delays and a population that is having to be more active the demand for private practice treatment is increasing every day. Therapists benefit from technical solutions we provide to make their job easier, more efficient and more effective.</p><p>We are fully funded, revenue generating and fast growing.</p><p><b>The role will involve: </b></p><p>You would be working with a highly experienced Technical Director on an exciting fast-growing platform business using advanced cloud technologies.</p><p>Your role would live and breathe the front end, implementing new features whilst maintaining and improving existing ones. We work very much as a team with the business and the technical side working closely together and a flat management structure so all views and opinions are valued.Whilst initially the role would be office based to get up to speed then we are big believers in the work getting done in the most effective way so there are opportunities for remote and flexible working.</p><p><b>Required: </b></p><ul><li>You are competent in VueJS and Axios. Other reactive frameworks are accepted, but VueJS is our choice.</li><li>You see the limitations of jQuery and are keen to step away from it (or avoid it).</li><li>You have good experience with either Foundation, Bootstrap, Tailwind, or any other such framework.</li><li>You are annoyed by inconsistencies. Why is the primary button on the left, whereas it’s on the right everywhere else? Why is the margin 6rem here where it’s 4rem there?</li><li>You test in all browsers and think mobile-first. Microsoft Edge is a big improvement but still has its little fusses.</li><li>You have your own side projects which you’d love to show us.</li><li>You know your way around the element inspector or have a wealth of tools you prefer to use to really see what’s going on.</li><li>You are familiar, but careful with NPM, Yarn etc. We won’t expect you to define the toolchain as we have one, but feel free to improve it. Likewise, you give each library careful consideration rather than wildly installing dependencies.</li><li>You use js-lint, css-lint, though we can get you up to speed with these if not.</li></ul><p><b>What you can expect from us: </b></p><ul><li>We love being up to date with current frameworks and approaches. We learn from and teach each other such.</li><li>You will gain very strong industry experience with expected front-end tools under your belt. If this sounds like you already, your tools will be sharpened.</li><li>A fun, ambitious team with a lot of interesting features on the way which you will be a core part of.</li><li>Whilst we work hard, we also respect working smart rather than long. A nasty case of burnout won’t get us very far.</li></ul><p><b>Benefits: </b></p><ul><li>Flexible working: time and location</li><li>Pension</li><li>An amazing office right next to Cardiff Central Station with all the benefits that brings including free tea/coffee etc.</li><li>Healthcare: free physiotherapy treatment and personal training.</li></ul><p><b>Salary</b></p><ul><li>£22,000-£25,000 dependent on experience</li></ul><p>Job Type: Full-time</p><p>Salary: £22,000.00 to £25,000.00 /year</p><p>Experience:</p><ul><li>Web Development: 1 year (Preferred)</li><li>VueJs: 1 year (Preferred)</li><li>JavaScript: 1 year (Preferred)</li></ul></div><div><div><div><span></span></div><span>Cardiff CF10</span></div><div><div><span></span></div><span>£22,000 - £25,000 a year</span></div></div>",

For this role we are looking for a &quot;full stack&quot; generalist who has the experience and interest to be our team's frontend expert.</strong></p><p>Zymergen’s Automation team is building the technology for a reconfigurable, highly automated <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbXOIuTvEJ8' rel='nofollow'><em>industrial microbe factory</em></a>. Combined with the work done by our colleagues who are geneticists, data scientists, research associates, and many other disciplines, our work leads to new chemicals with properties <a href='https://youtu.be/1X9Npq2eQxo?t=275' rel='nofollow'><em>unlike anything that can be derived from petroleum</em></a>.</p><h4><strong>ABOUT THE JOB</strong></h4><p>You will contribute to the code that controls the many different <a href='https://medium.com/@ZymergenTechBlog/the-case-for-modular-lab-automation-c34f214e1276' rel='nofollow'><em>types of machinery that make up our microbe factory</em></a>, adding support for new equipment types, improving the user interfaces for scientists, scaling the scheduling software to support larger transport systems, improving observability tools to monitor the factory, and generally working towards support for more complex automated workflows.</p><p>We call this role “Software Engineer” and not “Automation Engineer” on purpose: Our tech stack combines a modern web tech stack with a few cherry-picked components you’d find in a traditional process control system. Our codebase currently contains REST APIs served by Django apps, Vue.js for user interfaces (and simple Django forms with sprinkles of jQuery for others), Python’s asyncio in worker processes, and a collection of device drivers (also written in Python). Our infrastructure includes Kubernetes, Puppet-managed EC2 nodes, Kafka, MySQL, as well as a few Windows machines and PLCs.</p><p>The project you will start on has been in flight for two years. Some days you will be working on a brand new service to add a major new feature. On other days you will be fixing bugs or troubleshooting misbehaving robots in production (you might be wearing a lab coat). We use two-week sprints to structure our work, with every team member being responsible for keeping track of one or two ongoing efforts. Who works on what is driven just as much by our current skills as by what we want to learn.</p><p>One specific area our team is trying to get better at is frontend development and we hope that you can play a role in that. Be prepared to spend 50% or more of your time designing and implementing user interfaces. All our users are internal to Zymergen: They include scientists who need to tell the robots what to work on, support engineers who troubleshoot misbehaving robots, and managers who rely on <a href='https://medium.com/@ZymergenTechBlog/visualizing-automation-usage-at-zymergen-970440a58568' rel='nofollow'><em>utilization data from our dashboards</em></a>.</p><h4><strong>ABOUT YOU</strong></h4><p>You have several years of experience working in technical software development role (SWE, SRE, web dev, etc). We do not expect you to have prior experience in the biotech industry or in working with robots. To make sure we can get you up to speed quickly on those things, you’ll need to bring a solid fundamental knowledge and recent hands-on experience with software development, working in a team, and the two foundational languages in our tech stack: Javascript and Python.</p><p>You might have a CS degree, or not. (If you do, you would be the first team member who has one.) We want to hear the stories about how you used your skills in thoughtful and interesting ways, whether you learned them in a school or elsewhere.</p><p>We are looking for a software engineer who cares about the product we are building at least as much as the code they are writing. Nobody gets micromanaged in our team, even junior engineers own complete problems and participate in architecture decisions and project management. Because you join the team as an experienced engineer, we expect you to be comfortable dealing with ambiguity and ready to mentor others to become excellent at it too.</p><p>In addition to writing code every day, you will review the work of others both at the design and implementation stage, design significant new features and infrastructure from scratch, and help maintain and prioritize our backlog and road map. When we deploy our work to a prototype system, you will be hands on with testing and troubleshooting, even in situations when it’s not clear if the problem is software or hardware or biology.</p><p>You will be the sixth member of a team of people who are excited to both introduce you to our tech and to learn from you! When you arrive, we will have an onboarding plan that gets you ready for working on critical path features and the gnarliest bugs within two or three months. We will save you a spot in the schedule for our biweekly chalk talk lineup, too!</p><p>A note on logistics: This is <em>not</em> a remote job. At least some of your work will involve (expensive!) machines which are located in our laboratories in Emeryville, CA. Emeryville is one of the biotech hubs in the Bay Area’s “tech industry” and easy to commute to: Zymergites bicycle or ride public transit from Berkeley and Oakland, take the train or company shuttle from the South Bay, and BART or drive from SF. We don’t have fixed working hours: Most of us meet in the office on most weekdays. Most meetings happen between 11am and 4pm, if you work from home you can always videocall in.</p><p>Legal authorization to work in the U.S. is required. Zymergen may agree to sponsor an individual for an employment visa now or in the future if there is a shortage of individuals with particular skills for this job. In compliance with federal law, all persons hired will be required to verify identity and eligibility to work in the United States and to complete the required employment eligibility verification form upon hire.</p>                </div><a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/embed/job_app?for=zymergen&amp;token=1754529' rel='nofollow'>Apply now!</a>",

Emulating the models of Netflix and Goodreads we're building robust discovery mechanisms, data-driven recommendations, and next generation tools to engage with theatre and other performing arts.</p><p>We are looking for a Frontend or Full-stack Engineer to join us, ideally on a full-time basis, to help us continue to scale and enhance our theatre discovery platform. We're really proud of the product we've built, are getting great response from our users and the theatre industry and have had over 3k users in just a few weeks. We have a clear, exciting roadmap of enhancements and innovations ahead of us and are looking to add more bench strength to an already strong team so we can accelerate progress. </p><p>Our team:</p><p>We're a pretty focused and skilled bunch (ex-Amazon, Adidas, fintech, BBC, etc.), based in London. We love feedback and collaboration and have lots of exciting problems to solve, so would love to find someone that cares about our mission: to remove barriers-to-entry for potential theatre-goers and be the most trusted way to access theatre. We're based in London's South Bank and have weekday access to a stunning, unique co-working space.</p><p>You:</p><p>Ideally you care deeply about clean code, scalable solutions and delivering scrappy but error-free enhancements for users. So ideally looking for someone with deep experience in quickly implementing straightforward solutions. We are not interested in hiring a dispersed remote team that we can't get to know or actively collaborate with - we need you to bring your passion, problem-solving and curiosity to our work. Our diversity of perspectives helps us find and implement the best solutions. Ideally you have deep experience in React and single-page web apps, and experience/willingness to dive in on Next.js. Backend is Python/Django, infrastructure is AWS and we're very open to full-stack generalists provided the frontend skills are strong. Experience with Auth0, Prismic CMS, FB social plugin integrations, or SendGrid/email all helpful as well.</p><p>Where we're at:</p><p>Our beta is exceeding all expectations so we've doubled down on speed, and thus posting this role. Exciting times. Thespie is a disruptive model in our space, so continuing to improve the platform and deliver on our roadmap is essential - but unrealistic timelines, angst and blame are not part of the equation. We're heads down on building and moving fast because we love what we do, and have big things we need to deliver for theatre-goers.</p><p>If the above sounds like you - or you're excited about what we're doing, please apply and/or connect! We love meeting new people interested in the problems we're solving.</p>",

The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry.

You have the perfect balance of left and right brain, with an eye for great dynamic industrial style and the mind to implement the complex logic to drive it. HTML/CSS/ES6 are second-nature to you, you are equally comfortable with CSS keyframes and HTML Canvas as well as Javascript asynchronous functions and DOM manipulation.</p><p>You are very adaptable, and know that there is no single way or right way to develop. You understand that the endsare more important than the means, and the endswill forever evolve and always introduce new challenges. You don’t hesitate to abandon code or methodology in favor of something new that better solves the current problem. You thrive in doing something that has never been done before.</p><p>Adacado client-side applications contain most of our business rules, and you will be expected to design, implement, and maintain complicated business logic as per our architecture. Your designs and code will be expected to effectively manage data efficacy, data versioning, and all calls to our various APIs.</p><p>As a developer at Adacado you will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new features in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis. You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of constant group learning as we exchange expertise and experience with each other. You have no problems spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill. You understand that the best tool for the job is teamwork.</p><p>The Adacado Platform</p><p>The Adacado SAAS platform (and its roadmap) creates many interesting technical challenges. Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, and ES6, and utilizes Node, Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch. We manage an ever growing army of microservices (150+ unique across 300+ deployments) with special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.</p><p>The Adacado Team</p><p>Everyone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit. We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource.</p><p>We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours, and a generous skills-development/education budget. All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun!)</p><p>Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit. Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks. We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.</p><p>Location</p><p>This is role is based in our Vancouver office and applicants must be eligible to work in Canada.

We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.</p><p>We're a stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.</p><p>Our team is composed of open-source enthusiasts, former audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going, fun-loving, dedicated folks.</p><p>About you:</p><p>- You know that product development goes off the rails without rapid, early feedback from real users.</p><p>- You believe that &quot;looks great&quot; does not necessarily equal &quot;feels great&quot;, and that the latter is higher priority (but your favorite applications accomplish both!).</p><p>- You feel that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture. Differing viewpoints are borne from differing backgrounds, and lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.</p><p>- You're annoyed that modern websites ship megabytes of unnecessary dependencies to user's browsers. You're painfully aware of the difference between &quot;DRY&quot; as an important guiding principle of software development, and &quot;DRY&quot; as a cargo-cult mentality used to justify lazy over-coupling of code.</p><p>- You simultaneously hate and love Javascript, and are excited about various LLVM-based languages' recent progress targeting WebAssembly.</p><p>- You have a battle-tested workflow for debugging performance issues and deciding which layer of the stack merits optimization.</p><p>- You sigh at bullet-pointed job descriptions that try to prescribe visceral emotional reactions to technical opinions.</p><p>Outside of the browser, our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. Our nascent tooling for serving data to the browser is written in Julia as well. We're still experimenting with various parts of our tech stack, however - come help us make the right decisions!</p><p>Contact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.</p><p>P.S. We're also hiring for Lead Android and Lead DevOps roles!</p>",

We operate in over 250 cities: from Sydney to Tokyo to London to New York.</p><br /><p>We believe time is valuable and you should be able to make the most of it. We focused on simplicity, security and scalability, to create an innovative service accessible to everyone.</p><br /><p>Stasher is one of London&rsquo;s fastest growing startups. Venture backed by the likes of Wayra (Telefonica), VentureFriends.vc and HOWZAT partners, Stasher is on an exciting mission to improve the experience of travelling. Winners of Expedia&rsquo;s inaugural travel startup competition, Stasher also won Pitch@Palace 10.0 in Buckingham Palace and was named Travolution and VisitEngland&rsquo;s Startup of the Year.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>About the team / tech:</strong></p><br /><p>The main app is built with the isomorphic Next.js React framework but has a lot of custom work on top of it. We use Redux and React hooks and try to stay as cutting edge as possible without sacrificing stability or code scalability. We also have a few smaller projects and internal tools and have recently launched webview apps on both iOS and Android.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We're pretty happy with our current tech core, but for the next phase we&rsquo;re focusing a lot more on speed, scalability and reliability which may require quite a bit of refactoring. We are considering rebuilding the core booking flow as a PWA, for offline support and all the other goodies, and building React Native apps to replace the webview ones.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re running Python (Flask) and PostgreSQL on the backend and use Heroku for hosting as well as Cloudflare and a myriad other services for infrastructure.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Who are we looking for:</strong></p><br /><p>We are looking for a mid-level frontend developer to work with our frontend team on developing our website (React) and associated tools - and potentially apps (React native).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Beside the technical requirements, you need to be able to work collaboratively and communicate your ideas and decisions to tech and non tech people alike. We&rsquo;re still a small team, so you need to be fairly independent and confident in making your own decisions.</p><br /><p>The below is a guideline but it&rsquo;s not a strict requirement to tick all the boxes:</p><br /><p>- 2+ years experience in a frontend role<br />- Good understanding of React app architecture and current frontend ecosystem<br />- Reasonable understanding of backend technologies (databases, python, APIs)<br />- Experience with Next.js is a plus<br />- Experience with unit tests is a plus<br />- Startup experience is a plus</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Perks:</strong></p><br /><p>Stock options &ndash; share in the success that we build!<br />25 days holiday + bank holidays + 1 extra day holiday per year with Stasher.<br />Equipment and learning budget<br />Great workspace in Shoreditch<br />WFH options<br />Regular team socials &ndash; sometimes abroad!<br />Drinks each friday<br />Lots of free fruit and food at office + team meals</p>",

    "content": "<h1><strong>About us</strong></h1><br /><p>We are on a journey to make pet healthcare more accessible, and we want you to help us! Did you know that only 8% of health issues are seen by a veterinary professional? In real numbers: pets experience 24 issues per year, but only 2 of them make it to the vet. This isn&rsquo;t because people are bad at being pet owners &mdash; going to the vet can be expensive, and takes a lot of effort, and sometimes it&rsquo;s even embarrassing. We want to remove all these barriers that stop pet parents from seeking expert care so that our pets can live the long and healthy lives they deserve.</p><br /><p>Our mission is to empower vets to advocate for their patients wherever and whenever suits them. Our current product provides an app-based approach that allows vets to interact with their patients through a combination of chat and video consultations. The future holds lots of exciting opportunities to expand this into the go-to app for all things pet care related. Gula recently raised a pre-seed round of funding, and off the back of that, we are looking to build the beginnings of our product team, which is where you come in. With a goal like allowing pets to live healthier lives, a fantastic experience across all our user facing products is going to be key to overcoming challenges in changing the way pet owners think about how they interact with their care providers.</p><br /><p>Our customer facing products right now are in the form of iOS &amp; Android apps written in React Native, with a web-app soon to follow. We use AWS for much of our backend functionality;&nbsp; Lambda, DynamoDB, and Elasticsearch underpin our API, providing a <em>blazing fast</em>&nbsp; experience for our users. We also use various other cloud services like Pusher, Twilio, and Stripe for added areas of functionality. Our backend code is written in JavaScript right now, but we are open to any language that is suitable for the job, and we have experience deploying Python and Rust services to production.</p><br /><h1><strong>Who we&rsquo;re looking for</strong></h1><br /><p>Gula&rsquo;s CTO, Will, is the sole engineer. You would be working with him day-to-day which gives you the opportunity to help architect the ways of working in the product team and put in place what we would consider to be best practices. As the engineering team is in its infancy, you will be responsible for all things tech. While this seems broad, it would be a great opportunity for somebody looking to make their mark on an engineering organisation. Here are some projects you might work on in the next six months:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Building a membership management section across BE &amp; FE.</li><br /><li>Rebuilding our website so it speaks to our target customers better.</li><br /><li>Architect a complete CI/CD solution for our BE services.</li><br /><li>Building a component library to be used across our native and web apps.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>React Native experience is not necessary, but it will be where a lot of your work is based right now. You might be perfect for this role if most of these apply to you:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>You have extensive experience with React or a similar technology</li><br /><li>You have built responsive web apps</li><br /><li>You consider a close relationship with the UX team mandatory for building great products</li><br /><li>You have worked in a start-up</li><br /><li>You have experience working with languages other than JavaScript</li><br /><li>You would describe yourself as an animal lover</li><br /><li>You are happy working autonomously</li><br /><li>You love learning new things</li><br /></ul><br /><h1><strong>Application process</strong></h1><br /><p>Once we have reviewed your CV and have decided that we could be a great mutual match, we&rsquo;d start with a short phone call or coffee to tell you more about what we&rsquo;re trying to achieve at Gula long-term and also to give you some more details about the role. Then if successful there would be a final stage where we&rsquo;d spend some more time talking about technical topics, and you would meet Gula&rsquo;s CEO Thom to find out more about our values and to see if you&rsquo;d fit in.</p><br /><h1><strong>The benefits</strong></h1><br /><ul><br /><li>Pay &pound;55,000-65,000</li><br /><li>Stock options</li><br /><li>Flexible hours</li><br /><li>Working from home when you want</li><br /><li>25 days holiday</li><br /><li>Pick your own hardware up to &pound;2000</li><br /><li>Training budget</li><br /><li>Central London office</li><br /></ul>",

We encourage you to explain your approach, be collaborative and ask questions. The goal of taking you through different parts of the stack is to confirm your areas of strength and passion. We also like to see fluency with your chosen tools. &nbsp;It’s totally expected for you to use search engines while you’re problem-solving, we just ask that you’re mindful of how much you’re relying on them. &nbsp;You'll be working through the exercises on your own machine, using the tools of your choice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Code day with one of our development hiring teams&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* Our code day is meant to be a day in the life of our Software Developer role. &nbsp;You’ll join us for the day, work with our team and build an application. &nbsp;You’ll simulate a mini sprint by planning a project with a Software Developer, Database Administrator, Product Manager and Engineering Manager. &nbsp;You’ll have a combination of individual work time and pair programming with a Software Developer. &nbsp;At the end of the day, you’ll demo your application and dig into the code. &nbsp;You’ll have tons of opportunities to ask us questions and really learn what it’d be like to work at CoverMyMeds. &nbsp;We’re happy to conduct this step virtually for our remote candidates to get a good sense for how a remote Software Developer role would feel.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA quick note: If you’d prefer different logistics to accommodate your individual needs and set you up for success, let us know how we can help. &nbsp;We want this process to be accessible and inclusive for you.  </div> </div>",

Our clients include NGOs, state and national governmental agencies, and several of the largest forest landowners in the world.\\n\\nOur work has been featured in [The Wall Street Journal,](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ai-might-be-used-to-battle-wildfires-11554168366) [Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90269483/how-ai-software-could-help-fight-future-wildfires), and the [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190226-how-to-bring-wildfires-back-under-control). Through our collaboration with Microsoft as an AI for Earth grantee we’ve been able to create the first ever high resolution nationwide forest inventory, with data for every acre in America. Looking forward, we believe that recent advancements in remote sensing, cloud computing, and AI - combined with deep domain expertise - puts us in a unique position to build the future of forestry. If we ship even half of the things we have planned for 2020, it will be a wild year and we can’t do it without you.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n In this role, you’ll work closely with project managers to help design the next generation of forestry software. We’re a small team, so you’ll be contributing at all levels of the process - from initial UI/UX sketches to phone calls with users in the field about their experience with the new feature.\\n\\nSilviaTerra is a fully remote company, working loosely US hours. Some travel will be required to company meetings (3-4 weeks per year).\\n \\n\\n# Requirements\\nA successful candidate will have the following:\\n\\n* Experience with Python, Docker, and Linux based development\\n* Front end experience - can design product UI/UX. HTML/CSS/Javascript. Has googled “how to vertically center a div” before at least a few times (and knows they will have to again!)\\n* Ability to manage their own work remotely\\n* A highly organized, communicative and collaborative work style\\n\\nWe'd be extra excited if you have:\\n\\n* Experience with React/Redux, Django\\n* Experience building mobile applications\\n* Dev Ops experience. Digital Ocean/AWS/Azure, CI/CD.\\n* General interest in forestry. For this position, we won’t need you to be able to distinguish between a Pine and Spruce (hint: it’s the needles!). We have a separate Biometrics Team for that. However, we hope you can get excited about nature or, at the very least, a good game of Photosynthesis the Board Game. \\n\\n#Location\\n- US-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world and provide skills that will enhance our business intelligence system to help us make better decisions.\\n\\nWe’ll teach you the ins and outs of the online business brokerage industry, coming from years of experience. You’ll work on improving the customer journey, which should be flawless, pain free and easy to navigate. For many of our customers it is the first time either buying or selling an online business, which can be an incredibly anxious and confusing moment in their lives. You’ll be helping them directly by providing them with an easy to use interface that just makes sense.\\nThe Senior Full Stack Engineer position is vital to the success of our company, partnering with all departments to align technology strategy with the company’s objectives.\\n\\nOur small and close knit engineering team currently consists of a UX specialist, 2 frontend engineers, one backend engineer, one WordPress engineer and several QA specialists. You’ll work closely with the team to implement solutions for all departments within Empire Flippers, be it compliance, customer support, sales and migrations. Additional responsibilities could lead to supervising our engineering team.\\n\\nThis is a full time position – our company is growing at a fast rate, which means excellent opportunities for personal and career growth. We may ask you to attend conferences too, which can help you network with industry leaders.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n You’ll take on the challenge of improving the overall efficiency of Empire Flippers by developing fully fledged platforms, ensuring both the user experience and functionality are elevated to unprecedented levels. You’ll be responsible for the full software development life cycle, from conception to deployment building high quality, architecturally sound systems. You will use your initiative to design and implement client-side and server-side architecture, as well as implement API’s and integrations that address our business needs. Both our clients and staff will be using the software you write and you’ll be responsible for monitoring system performance and configuring new software and hardware. \\n\\n# Requirements\\nYou must have a passion for travel, ideally with long periods of digital nomad experience with travel outside your home country.\\n\\nYou should have at least 5 good years of full stack experience under your belt, having implemented some complex, data driven applications. Your portfolio speaks louder than your words.\\n\\nYou should have team-lead or management experience with a remote team.\\n\\nAn in-depth understanding of database management systems, both relational and non-relational databases.\\n\\nHands on experience in IT, computer systems engineering, or systems engineering and analysis is necessary.\\n\\nYou should have an ability to conduct technological analyses and research, with a solid understanding of technological trends to build strategy.\\n\\nYou should be a ninja with every component of our tech stack. You must have a complete working knowledge of Ruby on Rails, SQL, Postgres, Sidekiq, Rspec, Git, Redis.\\n\\nExperience working with a wide range of 3rd party integrations. Our platform talks to many 3rd party applications, you should have experience building and maintaining such integrations in a test driven fashion.\\n\\nDev-ops/sysadmin skills, particularly AWS. Experience with managing servers, maintaining hosting environments, being responsible for uptime and responsiveness, addressing bottlenecks, ensuring backups are kept safe and sound.\\n\\nYou need to have immaculate attention to detail. We need to hear you grunting and moaning if something doesn’t quite look or feel right, to the nearest code change and to the nearest hexadecimal color, to the point you become annoying to us. At times other developers may edit your code, you’ll be watching to ensure the code base remains readable, scalable and fast.\\n\\nBe a good communicator. It sounds very cliché, but you’ll immerse yourself in almost every department, you’ll be learning problems and presenting solutions, and also overseeing the implementation of those solutions too.\\n\\nA self-starter. We need to see some evidence that you’re able to get up every morning, bite the bullet and just get on with it, even if you’ve tried four coffee shops and none have decent wifi. You won’t have eyes looking over your shoulder on a day to day basis, you’ll be working in almost full autonomy, we’ll need to trust you to deliver the goods. We don’t believe in micro-management.\\n\\nA complete working knowledge in React. Our client code is written in React. Being able to navigate the front-end code and patch things up is needed.\\n\\nThe following skills/experience would be a bonus, but not required:\\n\\nPHP/WordPress. We will be interfacing with WordPress significantly, being able to speak the same language would be great.\\n\\nDatabases. A comprehensive experience working with various types of SQL and noSQL databases would be very useful. MySQL, Postgres, DynamoDB, Cassandra, to name a few.\\n\\nCaching. The software we’re building needs to be fast and to remain fast as we scale, both in terms of traffic and database size. Having experience with Memcached, Varnish or experience with complicated CDN setups with many rules would be a plus. \\n\\n#Salary\\n$120,000\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

We are building the data exchange platform, backed by a network of hundreds of health systems and thousands of app developers, that provides consistent, easy access to the developers building the next generation of healthcare technology.</p><p>By eliminating access to healthcare data as a barrier to entry, we are enabling the technical innovation that will allow healthcare providers to better care for patients and for patients to better control their health.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Transparent Communication- Regular All Team Meetings</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work - work anywhere in the US!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Open Source languages</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Open PTO - Flexible time off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance Day 1</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k Day 1</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Parental Leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Productivity Stipend</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.</p><p>We are a socially conscious, distributed team. We give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living where you’re most comfortable and working in areas where you can help foster and grow the community that you are a part of.</p><p>We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth. As one of our first front-end developers, your decisions will have an outsized influence on the future of our product.&nbsp;You’ll take input from product, design, and customers and then you’ll collaborate with other experienced, passionate engineering team to build the frameworks and features that will support our customers now, and in the future.</p><p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong></p><ul><li>Collaborative. You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together.</li><li>Customer focused. User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if the customers don't enjoy using it.</li><li>Disciplined and reliable. We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.</li><li>Appreciative of honest feedback. You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</li><li>Work smarter and harder. You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.</li><li>Analytical and practical mind. You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.</li></ul><p><strong>Front-End at Crisp&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Statically typed, modern languages. We use TypeScript and React for the UI, and GraphQL with Apollo to communicate with our backend.&nbsp;Knowledge of these specific technologies is not a requirement. If you’re willing to learn, we’re willing to help you along the way.</li><li>Continuous deployment. Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</li><li>Micro-services. Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.</li><li>Start-up mode.&nbsp;The team is still small, and the product is fresh.&nbsp;You’ll be able to exert a large amount of influence, and contribute to decisions that will determine the future of the product and the team.</li></ul><p>We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products.

Das Tool soll&nbsp;Maschinenbauern erstmalig einen Modulbaukasten an die Hand geben, der Usability- und Designregeln automatisch befolgt, Spaß macht und ein ausgereiftes HTML5 HMI generiert, ohne dass auf Kundenseite tiefe Fachexpertise notwendig ist.&nbsp;Wenn Du Teil einer&nbsp;innovativen Produktentwicklung rund um das Thema intelligente&nbsp;Maschineninterfaces&nbsp;werden möchtest, dann bist Du bei uns richtig.</p><p>Als Frontend-Entwickler konzipierst Du Teile der Webanwendungen mit JavaScript, Typescript, HTML und CSS und setzt UI-Designs um. Du bist stark in der technischen Konzeption und im API-Design und&nbsp;implementierst zusammen mit dem Team&nbsp;neue Features.&nbsp;</p><p>Da wir ein kleines Team sind, legen wir viel Wert auf eigenverantwortliches und zuverlässiges Arbeiten. Wann und wo Du Deine Arbeit am besten erledigen kannst, weißt Du selbst am besten. Deine Arbeitszeiten und ob Du im Büro oder Remote arbeiten möchtest, kannst Du daher selbst festlegen. Über Slack, Github, u.a.&nbsp;können wir trotzdem jederzeit Ideen und Fragen austauschen.</p><p>Da unsere Software einer technisch anspruchsvollen Branche&nbsp;dient, sind uns gute Lösungen wichtiger als schnelle. Wir nehmen uns daher immer die Zeit, unsere Entwicklung gut zu planen und unsere Ergebnisse mit Tests und Performance-Tools zu prüfen.&nbsp;</p><p>Entwicklerkonferenzen&nbsp;gehören für uns jedes Jahr fest zum Programm um mit anderen Entwicklern im Gespräch zu bleiben und einen Blick über den eigenen Tellerrand zu werfen. Als Entwickler experimentieren wir liebend gerne mit neuen Technologien und überlegen, was sich sinnhaft in unser Produkt&nbsp;integrieren lässt. Die Abstraktion individueller Kundenanforderungen und&nbsp;Maschinentypen in generische und zeitgemäße Toolbausteine ist eine anspruchsvolle Aufgabe und die Arbeit an&nbsp;unserem&nbsp;stetig wachsenden Produkt wird garantiert nie langweilig.</p><p><strong>Was wir suchen:</strong></p><ul><li>Sehr gute Kenntnisse von React, TypeScript, HTML und CSS</li><li>Gutes Gespür für grafische Details</li><li>Erfahrung mit Git</li><li>Stark in der technischen Konzeption</li><li>Entwickler mit Wohnort in D/A/CH und guten Deutschkenntissen</li></ul><p><strong>Worüber wir uns freuen – oder was du gerne bei uns lernen würdest:</strong></p><ul><li>Erfahrung in Backend-Entwicklung mit Node.js</li><li>Erfahrung GraphQL und&nbsp;Sketch</li><li>Erfahrung in der Produktentwicklung</li></ul><p><strong>Unser Bewerbungsprozess:</strong></p><ul><li>Bewerbung mit Deinem Portfolio</li><li>Telefoninterview mit&nbsp;technischer Leitung</li><li>Persönliches Gespräch mit Geschäftsleitung und Kollegen bei uns im Büro</li><li>Anschließend Rückmeldung und Angebot innerhalb von 2 Wochen</li></ul><p><em>Wir freuen uns auch, wenn Du anderweitige Programmierkenntnisse hast und uns davon etwas zeigen willst.&nbsp;</em><em>Wir möchten Deine Fähigkeiten und Motivation nicht nur anhand von Zeugnissen beurteilen.

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone’s day, you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p><p>At NearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.</p><p><strong>Our company</strong>:</p><p>Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.</p><p><br>More information:<a href='https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/' rel='nofollow'> https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/</a></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/287824?reset=False&amp;ra=1ywGIJdBrCCs&amp;oqs=a%3D1ywGIJdBrCCs%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>International environment with distinctive colleagues</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Feedback culture to help everyone grow</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly learning seminars</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly company trip</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Several trips to our HQ in Copenhagen per year</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Budget for conferences</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Have an impact on the industry that powers global trade</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Our developers work from home and co-working spaces and sometimes even on the beach!&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>competitive compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>amazing start-up projects</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>inclusive cultural environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>technical mentorship</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>non-intrusive work environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Agile processes set-up</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>community involvement</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We need a senior developer and we&rsquo;ve made a video for the role <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXMR9RmDG7c&amp;feature=youtu.be'>here</a>. <br /><br /></p><br /><p>The concept of the app is to give people video calls with a lawyer at the press of a button, to deal with their problems like employment, matrimonial, tax and property. Most people have never used a lawyer (other than perhaps for conveyancing) and we want to change that. It is similar to the Babylon health app but for lawyers instead of doctors.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>This is a fantastic opportunity to make a difference and work with a dynamic and forward thinking startup team. We encourage teamwork and open discussion, especially for problem solving, and we have a real passion for bringing the provision of legal services up to date using tech. In fact, Monaco Solicitors was recently shortlisted in the Law Society Excellence Awards for innovation in technology.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>The product team currently consists of 1 front end dev and 2 designers plus a product owner. To give you a little sneak peek of what you will be building, our app will feature the following:</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Account creation (both Lawyers and clients)</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Lawyer and user profiles</li><br /><li>Calendar booking system with availability</li><br /><li>Cloud stored documents/paperwork</li><br /><li>Provision of advice from Lawyer in paid sessions, including video call</li><br /><li>Payment gateway</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Skills Required</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Building React &amp; React Native apps&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Building PWA (progressive web apps)</li><br /><li>Javascript, ES6+</li><br /><li>NodeJs (AWS lambda / serverless)</li><br /><li>Minimum 6-8 years of Experience in creating Web &amp; Apps solutions</li><br /><li>IT infrastructure and cloud development</li><br /><li>Software architecture design</li><br /><li>DevOps</li><br /><li>Project and product management</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Coding (minimum 50% of the role)</li><br /><li>Analysing requirements and coming up with appropriate solutions</li><br /><li>Setting up the workflow for devs&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Guiding and participating in stack selection</li><br /><li>Project management, agile / scrum&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Nice to have</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>AWS ecosystem experience</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Competitive salary</li><br /><li>Pension scheme</li><br /><li>Opportunity to work from home&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Unique office space (converted multi-storey car park in Peckham</li><br /></ul>",
