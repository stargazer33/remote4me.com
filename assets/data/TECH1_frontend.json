We’re always building and shipping, but with an appreciation for the theoretical. We work closely with our users, technology partners, and engage with the global decentralization community on and offline.</p>  <p>From our very beginnings having a female cofounder: we are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We strongly encourage applications from women, transgender or non-binary people, people of color, people with disabilities, or anyone traditionally underrepresented in tech.</p>  <p><strong>Location:</strong> We’re in Berlin, Germany. If you don’t know much about Berlin, don’t fret. Almost all of us have immigrated here, from all over the world, from Canada to India, from Italy to USA. And we love it!</p>  <p><strong>Office time:</strong> We trust you to do your job, and doing your job is about getting the task done, not us looking over your shoulder. In general we try to be around the office here in Berlin but as with our technology, our team is often distributed and our processes are optimized so work can get done in a mix of on-site and remote work. If you feel you’re most effective working from a top of a mountain, please do.</p>  <p><strong>Choice of tech:</strong> We provide you with either a top-notch Dell or MacBook Pro laptop, and with everything else you need and chose to get your work done.</p>  <p><strong>Immigration:</strong> We’ll hold your hand in the visa / immigration process, which is smooth and surprisingly fast.</p>  <p><strong>Language:</strong> We speak English in the office. And in fact if you only speak English, you can easily get by in Berlin. (As is the case for many of our employees.)</p>  <p><strong>Transit:</strong> We’re spoiled, Berlin has one of the best public transit systems in the world. Our office is near a connection point of the underground (U-bahn) and trams. Berlin also has safe bike lines all throughout the city; you can park your bike in the office. We offer to reimburse half of you annual public transport ticket.</p>  <p><strong>Time off:</strong> Health first. Without health and happiness, what is left? So, our minimum paid leave per year is 25 days, plus statutory national holidays.</p>  <p><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Germany has one of the best healthcare systems in the world. Some of the nation’s top university hospitals are here in Berlin. Many of us have a family doctor just down the street from our office. Berlin is also great for sports.</p>  <p><strong>Parenting, Parental Leave:</strong> We love kids! And we recognize the time that parents need for their children’s’ well-being, not to mention their own well-being! So we want to give all the space in the world to new parents who wish to spend time with their children: mothers get fully paid maternity leave six weeks prior to birth and eight weeks after. In addition, there are 14 months of 2/3 paid leave, split between the parents according to the parents’ choice. And for general parental responsibilities that invariably come up, by all means, go attend to your child. We trust that you are a professional and know how to balance your time.</p>  <p><strong>Professional and Personal Growth:</strong> Ocean Protocol is at the epicenter of blockchains + big data + AI, so if you’re not learning, then something’s wrong! We’ll be giving you opportunities to represent us speaking at conferences, hosting hackathons, writing, and more. Finally, we give you an annual self-development budget that you choose as you wish to spend on books, personal conferences, and other things to grow yourself.</p>  <p><strong>Your next step?&nbsp;</strong></p>  <p>Are you up for working in an awesome team, learning a ton, and bringing blockchain to the masses?

We have exciting plans for product development and are looking for a number of superb developers to lead us through the next phase.<br /><br />We're building a true marketplace of under-utilised space. Just like Airbnb & Booking.com but for hourly or daily hire... with >16,000 spaces currently live across the UK ranging from school halls, universities, iconic buildings, and hotels.<br /><br />If you fancy a new challenge, early stage, venture backed start-up with a fun and energetic team, read on!<br /><br />We're looking for a number of full stack developers who can help take our business to the next level. We’re hiring in London, but would also consider a remote European location where we could recruit a team of 3-5 developers in our own office. You'll have 1-5 years' experience working on digital B2C products and have a passion for delivering only the best products to market. Perhaps you’re a senior developer or team leader with a small team looking for a new challenge? Alternatively, if it’s just you and you’re looking to turbo your career, please get in touch. <br /><br />We work truly agile and you'll spend most of your time building the next features for our users (of which there are many and exciting!):<br /><br />> Work with the commercial and customer teams to define and prioritise opportunities for optimisation on key product areas: venue onboarding, venue search results, venue presentation, enquiry process, messaging hub, ratings & reviews, rewards<br /><br />> Build in AI, personalisation & automation to make the business truly self-service for our organisers and hosts<br /><br />> Regular session replay to source issues and bugs<br /><br />> Select solutions for each product - build in house v borrow v buy<br /><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />Our tech stack is anchored in Javascript, with Node JS driving the core business logic. On top of this, we have an Angular / Mongo DB stack and a Ruby on Rails / PostgreSQL stack. Plus a little React now too. So, you’ll probably have experience of working in a number of frameworks to adapt to this environment. <br /><br />Be great if you have experience of working in a B2C environment with a dynamic, transactional website and you have an appreciation for commercialising the product.<br /><br />You’ll need to be highly self-sufficient and passionate about working in an early stage start-up company, along with the excitement, reward and risk that comes with it.<br /><br /><br />BENEFITS<br />Weekly beers and breakfasts.<br />Monthly bonus scheme.<br />Business travel to UK / Poland / Elsewhere.<br />A little team of wonderful people.<br />"

We’re working with ICOs, exploring the identity space, and looking forward to open-sourcing financial technology, which is desperately lacking appropriate and inclusive international standards.</p><p>Fractal’s 6-strong engineering team is known for its sky-high standards and aspirations. Software is hard, and we know it takes curiosity, passion, discipline, and patience to get it right.</p><p><strong>Your Profile</strong></p><p>There's a specific kind of person we're looking for. We understand we’re describing a rare breed, so it’s ok if you don’t meet all these requirements.</p><ul><li>You consider yourself a senior software engineer, and so do all of you peers.</li><li>You understand that “move fast and break things” is only a good philosophy when what you build is inconsequential.</li><li>You're excited to break out of an application's code and think about the system as a whole (tweaking nginx configs, thinking about load balancers, worrying about queues and their throughput).</li><li>You're the person your friends turn to when they hear about that new tech in Hacker News. They do that because you’re up to speed with the current trends and great at breaking down complex technology in a way that your juniors can grasp.</li><li>Someone at our team has done mutation testing by hand because they’re that careful about things. You don’t think this is crazy, and maybe have done the same yourself.</li><li>You get really angry if someone tries to takes away your agile, or your tests, or your continuous delivery, or.... You get the point.</li></ul><p><strong>Our values</strong></p><p>It’s always difficult to accurately write about one’s values in a way that captures their subtlety, but here's a decent start. We can chat more about it during the application process.</p><ul><li>Gather great talent: Have the best peers you could ask for, people you can continuously teach and learn with. We know A-players want to work with other A-players.</li><li>Enforce transparency: Every decision's process is documented in the clear, all information is available to everyone (to the extent of the law).</li><li>Include everyone: Consider all ideas from anyone. Even if it isn't your area of expertise, we encourage you to ask questions and contribute in any way you feel inclined.</li><li>Don't worry about salaries: We want our engineers thinking about code, not money. All engineers get paid enough to live a comfortable lifestyle.</li><li>Promote authenticity: We have an informal environment, and we believe getting along well is fundamental. Everyone's different and we're going to spend a third of our lives together, so we make sure everyone feels welcome.</li></ul><h3>Main requirements</h3><ul><li><p>You've built at least a handful of websites by now, of which at least one really challenged your software design skills and dealt with more than 10 concurrent users</p></li><li><p>DFA, BFS, DFS, A: these are not just words for you. You might not be totally in the know, but you'd know where to start. You can reason about algorithmic complexity and know which trade-offs to make</p></li><li>Your education and years of experience don’t matter but, when we speak, we need to feel like you’ve been doing this forever.</li><li><p>We build our web applications mostly in <strong>Ruby/Rails</strong> for the back-end and <strong>JavaScript/React</strong> for the front-end. We also have a bunch of services running <strong>Go.</strong> Our infra is docker-containerized and sits on <strong>AWS</strong> (Fargate/ECS and RDS PostgreSQL) and is managed through <strong>Terraform</strong>. We work with <strong>Bitcoin</strong>, <strong>Ethereum</strong> (and <strong>Solidity</strong>), and <strong>Lisk</strong>.</p></li></ul><h3>Nice to have</h3><ul><li>Understanding of blockchain technology, distributed systems, and cryptography.</li></ul><h3>Perks</h3><ul><li>Remote work, flexible hours, world-class engineering team</li></ul><p></p>"

We all have three things in common:</p><p>Put our personal lives first<br>Respect our work as a means to put our personal lives first<br>Understand that respect is measured by others enjoying and benefitting from  working with us</p><p>When working with us means you can forego the 9-5 in favor of working when you need to – wherever you want to.  We are creating the digital workspace of the future today. This workplace  is not only defined by the tools we use, but rather by the environment we create. Our team members each contribute to the success of each project and the company as a whole. We learn from each other, collaborate cohesively, help each other grow and hone our skillsets, and have fun together - from different corners of the world. Our work isn’t about creating busyness, we are here to build businesses through innovative inbound marketing. </p><p>If you are a good fit for us (and we for you), we will work together. Rather than make you fit into a position defined by a boxed-in title, we aim to understand your strengths, interests, and passions and how they can fit within our team. Depending on when you apply, as well as the amount of recent applicants, we might not have work for you right away. And due to the sheer amount of applicants, we are not able to respond to all of them personally or always fast enough. Most of our team members started out with a couple of hours a week. Some had other projects and some wanted to test the water before giving up on a full time job elsewhere.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to InboundLabs</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to InboundLabs</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>InboundLabs is hiring an extremely talented front end developer.</p><p>InboundLabs.co is an international agency-hybrid, with a remote team that works together seamlessly.

You turn on your monitor and join the hangout for your daily Standup. Call done, you hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. There are some GitHub PRs you need to review, so you head there first. The rest of the morning goes by working on that feature for the weekly client demo tomorrow. Lunchtime arrives so you head to your Yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls (where did the day go) and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone's day you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong></strong></p><p>At nearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields. Our role is to help them build solutions and platforms; help them to launch new product ventures and fundamentally change how they operate.</p><p>Join a highly skilled multidisciplinary team; typically consisting of designers, front-end and back-end experts, DevOps engineers, and also members of the client team.

Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. Elastic is backed by $104 million in funding from Benchmark Capital, Index Ventures, and NEA; has headquarters in Amsterdam and Mountain View, California; and has employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong>Kibana is the window into the Elastic Stack</strong></p><p>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developer who wants to add to Kibana and X-Pack? We want to meet you!</p><p><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Innovate, lead and contribute to front end and visualization experience of the Kibana and other UI products using JavaScript</li><li>Collaborate with other development teams, quality engineering team, and documentation team to execute on product work</li></ul><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Strong JavaScript programming skills</li><li>7+ years of front end development work</li><li>Experience with one modern MVC style JS Framework</li><li>Experience writing automated tests</li><li>Ability to work in a fast paced start-up environment</li><li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills, a great teammate with strong analytical, problem solving, debugging and troubleshooting skills</li><li>Strong preference for operational experience</li><li>Strong preference for knowledge of building complex data visualization and related tooling</li><li>Strong preference for Open Source experience</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><ul><li>Deeply competitive pay, medical, dental, vision, disability, benefits</li><li>Stock options</li><li>Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices</li><li>An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life</li><li>Passionate people building great products</li><li>Employees with a wide variety of interests</li><li>Your age is only a number.

We do not detect or predict anything.  We isolate everything.</p><p>Our technology includes a microkernel, super lightweight virtual machine manager (hypervisor) and encryption management designed to replace the vulnerable and large (14M+ lines of code) linux kernel that Android is built on.  Our microkernel is &lt; 100K lines of code, resulting in a super small attack surface and secure foundation for Android.  This is the first step.  </p><p>Next, we change how executables run on Android so that every application and its data, regardless if its a system app or one you download, runs in its own isolated environment.  </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Diego</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Android</span>, <span>Tablets</span>, <span>Cyber Security</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/secureduniverse' rel='nofollow'>@secureduniverse</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://blog.secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>http://blog.secureduniverse.com</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>secureduniverse.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Secured Universe</h3><ul><li><div>Design Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/73428-ui-ux-jedi' rel='nofollow'>UI/UX Jedi</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69250-aosp-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>AOSP Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69253-virtualization-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Virtualization Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69401-machine-learning-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Machine Learning Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/73426-kernel-hacker' rel='nofollow'>Kernel Hacker</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Operations Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69045-cfo-co-fundraiser' rel='nofollow'>CFO &amp;

You must be located in Florida and be able to interact in person with our team in Clearwater, FL. No contractors or agencies. Seriously.</p><p>Why We Started Guardian Trust</p><p>Guardian Trust was created for the sole purpose of helping people with disabilities financially qualify for public assistance programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI).</p><p>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is hefty, and we accomplish it by leveraging technology and hiring the best.</p><p>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</p><p>The development shop we’ve partnered with over the last few years, Very, is a remote-first company, and we’ve fully embraced this concept alongside them. About 30% of the Very dev team works out of HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. &nbsp;Currently, the Guardian Trust staff works full-time in Clearwater, FL. However, we see the benefit of remote work and welcome engineers who would like to work mostly remote. We ask that from time to time you come to the office to work directly with our staff using our trust management software. Especially in the beginning, we feel it’s essential to fully understand our workflows and advise on system improvement. &nbsp;</p><p>What You’ll Be Working On</p><p>Guardian in collaboration with Very, has built custom web-based CRM software to manage back-office workflows and the day-to-day operations of Trust management. You will have the opportunity to shape and grow the user experience to facilitate intuitive and efficient use. The web application integrates with a robust accounting system as well as a check-writing service. There is a strong focus on availability in the face of degraded performance from integrations. As such, you will be able to leverage the strengths of Elixir to continue providing a high-quality experience as part of the Guardian team.</p><ul><li>Elixir (Phoenix)</li><li>JavaScript (React)</li><li>Redis</li><li>Postgres</li><li>AWS</li><li>Heroku</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This Role: Senior Software Engineer</p><p>Your job will be to not only add on to our platform, but also to listen to the team using it and make continuous recommendations for improvement. While the Guardian Trust team doesn’t have a degree in programming, they truly understand leveraging smart software and taking care of their customers.</p><p>We’ve got lofty goals for growth— striving to help as many people with disabilities as possible. As a Senior Software Engineer at Guardian Trust, we expect you to not only bring a high level of programming expertise, but also a high-level of product ownership. We value collaboration, as well as exceptional communication with the ability to distill complex ideas in layman’s terms. We also value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineer to be as good a practitioner as they are a leader and teacher.</p><p>When you start working at Guardian, you’ll pair with our development partner, Very, to learn the ropes of the product and code-base, third-party integrations, deployment, business decisions, etc. Very will continue to be part of the code review process to ensure Guardian is well taken care of—and you’re set up for success.</p><p>How We Operate</p><p>We emphasize that outstanding people providing excellent service are the key to our success. We expect our employees to be careful and conscientious in their performance of duties, thoughtful and considerate of other people and courteous and helpful when dealing with other employees. We encourage our employees to improve proficiency in their respective jobs and to participate in continuing education opportunities that are relevant to their position.</p><p>Our standard workweek is Monday - Friday, and our office is open between the hours of 8:30 am and 5:00&nbsp;pm.</p><p>How You’ll Be Compensated</p><p>We believe in fair compensation, depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $120,000 annually upon joining the company. We have an excellent health plan available to our employees, and we cover 100% of the cost of the premium for our employee and their families. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a maximum of a 3% match based upon the percentage you contribute.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>How To Apply</p><p>This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in Florida.

Seriously. </span></p><p><span>Why We Started Guardian Trust</span></p><p><span>Guardian Trust was created for the sole purpose of helping people with disabilities financially qualify for public assistance programs such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). </span></p><p><span>Not to oversimplify things, but our mission is hefty, and we accomplish it by leveraging technology and hiring the best.</span></p><p><span>We Fully Embrace Working Remotely</span></p><p><span>The development shop we’ve partnered with over the last few years, Very, is a remote-first company, and we’ve fully embraced this concept alongside them. About 30% of the Very dev team works out of HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. &nbsp;Currently, the Guardian Trust staff works full-time in Clearwater, FL. However, we see the benefit of remote work and welcome engineers who would like to work mostly remote. We ask that from time to time you come to the office to work directly with our staff using our trust management software. Especially in the beginning, we feel it’s essential to fully understand our workflows and advise on system improvement. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>What You’ll Be Working On</span></p><p><span>Guardian in collaboration with Very, has built custom web-based CRM software to manage back-office workflows and the day-to-day operations of Trust management. You will have the opportunity to shape and grow the user experience to facilitate intuitive and efficient use. The web application integrates with a robust accounting system as well as a check-writing service. There is a strong focus on availability in the face of degraded performance from integrations. As such, you will be able to leverage the strengths of Elixir to continue providing a high-quality experience as part of the Guardian team.</span></p><ul><li><span>Elixir (Phoenix)</span></li><li><span>JavaScript (React)</span></li><li><span>Redis</span></li><li><span>Postgres</span></li><li><span>AWS</span></li><li><span>Heroku</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This Role: Senior Software Engineer</span></p><p><span>Your job will be to not only add on to our platform, but also to listen to the team using it and make continuous recommendations for improvement. While the Guardian Trust team doesn’t have a degree in programming, they truly understand leveraging smart software and taking care of their customers. </span></p><p><span>We’ve got lofty goals for growth— striving to help as many people with disabilities as possible. As a Senior Software Engineer at Guardian Trust, we expect you to not only bring a high level of programming expertise, but also a high-level of product ownership. We value collaboration, as well as exceptional communication with the ability to distill complex ideas in layman’s terms. We also value well-tested, reusable code and expect our engineer to be as good a practitioner as they are a leader and teacher. </span></p><p><span>When you start working at Guardian, you’ll pair with our development partner, Very, to learn the ropes of the product and code-base, third-party integrations, deployment, business decisions, etc. Very will continue to be part of the code review process to ensure Guardian is well taken care of—and you’re set up for success.</span></p><p><span>How We Operate</span></p><p><span>We emphasize that outstanding people providing excellent service are the key to our success. We expect our employees to be careful and conscientious in their performance of duties, thoughtful and considerate of other people and courteous and helpful when dealing with other employees. We encourage our employees to improve proficiency in their respective jobs and to participate in continuing education opportunities that are relevant to their position.</span></p><p><span>Our standard workweek is Monday - Friday, and our office is open between the hours of 8:30 am and 5:00 pm. </span></p><p><span>How You’ll Be Compensated</span></p><p><span>We believe in fair compensation, depending on your skill and experience, you can expect to make somewhere between $80,000 and $120,000 annually upon joining the company. We have an excellent health plan available to our employees, and we cover 100% of the cost of the premium for our employee and their families. We have a 401k program that we’ll provide a maximum of a 3% match based upon the percentage you contribute. </span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>How To Apply</span></p><p><span>This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in Florida. Thanks!</span></p><p><span>To apply, please send us a note to jobs-gt@verypossible.com with {{Guardian Trust Engineer}} in the subject line. Please include the following:</span></p><ol><li><span>What’s most important to you from a company culture and operating environment?</span></li><li><span>What are the biggest things that de-motivate you and make you unhappy when it comes to being an independent engineer within a company?</span></li><li><span>Your resume</span></li><li><span>Code samples with comments explaining what you did and how you architected the code.</span></li></ol><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>"

You’ll be an integral part of our product and engineering teams focused on architecting and developing our client-side programming.</p><p>We’re looking for a strong track record of architecting and building products. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>*What You'll Do*<br>* Lead development on the client layer and user experience.<br>* Develop a comprehensive HTML/CSS/JS framework for rendering web applications for multiple devices and themes.<br>* Refine the application building experience that makes it a delight for our customers to use and extend Knack.<br>* Consistently improve the speed, reliability, and performance of the Knack client application.<br>* Evaluate new technologies and help determine opportunities to leverage these.<br>* Work on implementing front-end Knack features.</p><p>How you’ll do this:<br>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our small engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*About You*<br>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You’re an outstanding communicator. You can document a problem, and clearly and succinctly outline a solution. You’re not afraid to distill things into plain English for teammates and customers.</p><p>You have experience working in fast-paced environments, prioritizing and balancing multiple projects, and working with cross-functional teams.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.</p><p>*About Knack*<br>Knack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data.</p><p>Knack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we’ve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>So why are we different?</p><p>We’re bootstrapped: we’ve had to build something our customers actually pay for. This changes how you do things.</p><p>We’re 100% remote: and have been from the beginning. Every decision we’ve made has been based around optimizing our remote operations.</p><p>We’re small: and we like it that way. We’re more than just chat avatars-- we’ve all gotten to know each other, have grown together, and love working with each other.</p><p>We enjoy the journey: we’re in this for the long haul. We’re not chasing an exit or the next round of funding. We’re building something we’re proud of and want to keep improving on.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*<br>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work. It’s not about separation, it’s about optimization.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. You’ll get forced days off for birthdays and knackiversaries.</p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p><p>Please note that we are only considering applicants legally eligible to work in the US.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Javascript, HTML, CSS, Front-End Development, UI/UX Design, Responsive Design, Product Design, Vue.Js</div><div>Compensation</div><div>$85K–$120K<br>1.0%–3.0%</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Knack</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/91908-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/91908-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Software Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/forkable/jobs/91908-software-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Forkable</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/36391-senior-javascript-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/36391-senior-javascript-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Senior JavaScript Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/36391-senior-javascript-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Knack</a></div><div>United States, Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knock-7/jobs/320477-front-end-engineer-remote-in-us?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knock-7/jobs/320477-front-end-engineer-remote-in-us?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front End Engineer - *Remote in US*</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knock-7/jobs/320477-front-end-engineer-remote-in-us?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Knock</a></div><div>Remote, United States, Charlotte</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/325636-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/325636-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front End Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/325636-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Gitcoin</a></div><div>Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/stealth-startup-52/jobs/309987-principal-ui-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/stealth-startup-52/jobs/309987-principal-ui-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Principal UI / Front End Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/stealth-startup-52/jobs/309987-principal-ui-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Stealth Startup</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/goodtimeio/jobs/307066-full-stack-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/goodtimeio/jobs/307066-full-stack-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Full Stack Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/goodtimeio/jobs/307066-full-stack-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>GoodTime</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/car-next-door/jobs/333056-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/car-next-door/jobs/333056-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front-End Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/car-next-door/jobs/333056-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Car Next Door</a></div><div>Sydney, Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/loremtech/jobs/322312-freelance-web-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/loremtech/jobs/322312-freelance-web-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Freelance Web Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/loremtech/jobs/322312-freelance-web-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Lorem Technologies</a></div><div>New York City</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/whereto/jobs/285945-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/whereto/jobs/285945-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front-End Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/whereto/jobs/285945-front-end-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>WhereTo</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>What We're Building</h3></div><div><div><p>Knack enables non-programmers to do amazing things with their data.

Using Fulfil.IO retailers can fulfill orders faster with a higher accuracy, which increases customer satisfaction and improves the bottom line.</p><p>Why? because e-commerce customers are an impatient lot. They want what they bought and they want it now. For these shoppers used to amazon prime and google express, fulfillment speed and accuracy are crucial to this customer experience. But in SMBs, fulfillment operations are antiquated and manual. </p><p>With Fulfil.IO, retailers never run out of inventory, can sell the same inventory across offline and online channels and ship faster to their customers.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Bengaluru</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>11-50

We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.</p><p>ConsenSys is presently comprised of a number of core personnel — some of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development, acquisitions, investments, or the formation of joint ventures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Brooklyn</span>, Remote

We're self-funded and doing this for 6.5 years. We believe in what we do, and are committed to the team and our value proposition. We give back plenty but are not able to compensate interns financially.</p><p>RiteKit interns share insights on the team, experience, career boosts: <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a></p><p>At our core:<br>&quot;Enhance&quot;: this feature is the gem at the center the RiteBoost automation dashboard and RiteForge, the social publishing SaaS. </p><p>The customer's customized &quot;Enhance&quot; does any/all of the following in one click: <br>• semantically determines topics of a post and auto-hashtags them for current and historical engagement <br>• Auto-emojify<br>• converts URLs in social posts to a custom tiny URL with a baked-in advertisement<br>• if the words in your post are not good as hashtags, Enhance adds up to two at the end of the post<br>• extracts a good image from images embedded in the body of a page, if the page's URL is in your post<br>• optional: highlight text or add &quot;quotes&quot; around text before Enhancing - this makes an image from the text, with a customer-branded image background.<br>• author attribution<br>• even more options are available</p><p>We serve enterprise customers, too: <a href='https://ritekit.com/api-demo' rel='nofollow'>https://ritekit.com/api-demo</a></p><p>We're growing fast, gaining traction, we're going big, and all the while, our culture continues to improve. No one works &quot;for&quot; RiteKit; we listen, mentor, involve people in the decision making. We work &quot;with&quot; people not above them. Please feel welcome to ask any of us to explain what the difference means to to them. See Hashtag Academy in Medium to see their interviews and read what they say about our impact on careers.</p><p>What do our interns do after us? Search RiteTag in LinkedIn, then do an advanced  search to see the people. Our interns either join the team or have moved on to PopSugar, Google, Snapchat and so on.</p><p>Our four SaaS products in 60 seconds: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to RiteKit</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to RiteKit</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>All RiteKit internships are UNPAID. If you are not considering internships without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you.</p><p>&quot;Hashtags! Yay!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No!!!&quot; That's not what we're about.</p><p>We began with total social media optimization: images, link ads and yes, machine learning powered auto-hashtagging, too. We build and market data-driven social media engagement SaaS products. Long-term: automating needless nuisance tasks out of business people's workflows. (See our APIs for examples.)</p><p>For those who need to get sales, sign-ups, or other specific goals met from what they share to Facebook, Twitter and beyond, RiteForge automates image creation and extraction, adds a call-to-action (something like an &quot;advert,&quot; you might say) to pages shared socially, and uses text analysis and machine learning to aid with hashtags as well.<br>Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>You would work remotely with the lead programmer and CTO. We have our engineering office in Prague, Czech Republic as well as distributed staff working from home/school in many countries.</p><p>FIRM REQUIREMENTS:<br>•  Must write clean, re-usable code (We will test you.)<br>•  Must be willing to commit to a minimum of 3 months X 20 hours/week. (There is no need or preferential treatment for those who agree to commit to longer than three months. Some decide to do so late in their internship.)<br>•  Understand that the internship is UNPAID. No salary, no stipend, etc. <br>•  64-bit computer with at least 8GB of system RAM<br>•  Python Django REST framework experience required<br>•  Fluency with javascript, vue.js, mysql, jquery, node.js preferred <br>•  Must be a self-starter with demonstrated interest (test the RiteForge browser extension before applying, please) in what we have done over the last 6.5 years and interest in being part of what we're building for improving the effectiveness of various aspects of a social media post (hashtag length, position, no. of hashtags, languages, sentiment, update length, mentions, link attributes, etc.).</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this). First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers. </p><p>WHAT YOU WILL LEARN if you excel at your first tasks when you work with us: <br>Conceiving and building data-backed recommendation functions, some using machine learning as well. <br>Doing backflips with social network APIs. <br>Learning to lead: if you are fast and good we will ask you to help others first, move into a leadership position very soon. Ask for specific people examples in your first interview - what they did to earn this, and the outcomes for them, both with us and in other companies.</p><p>We ship fast - and with over 250,000 registrations, when we make your latest feature live, your work will be seen and become part of the workflow for a great many business people.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>PHP, Javascript, MySQL, Node.js, Git, PHP Frameworks, Laravel, Nette Framework, Docker, React.js, Vue.Js, Django-Rest-Framework</div><div>Compensation</div><div>No Salary<br>No Equity</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to RiteKit</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/ritekit/jobs/57132-cross-platform-mobile-development-internship-flutter?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/ritekit/jobs/57132-cross-platform-mobile-development-internship-flutter?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Cross-Platform Mobile Developmen...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/ritekit/jobs/57132-cross-platform-mobile-development-internship-flutter?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>RiteKit</a></div><div>Earth</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/anyaupmarketing/jobs/304064-web-developer-internship?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/anyaupmarketing/jobs/304064-web-developer-internship?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Web Developer Internship</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/anyaupmarketing/jobs/304064-web-developer-internship?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>AnyaUp Global Marketing Network</a></div><div>Los Angeles, Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/kuplr/jobs/323944-backend-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/kuplr/jobs/323944-backend-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Backend Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/kuplr/jobs/323944-backend-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Kuplr</a></div><div>Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/custex/jobs/38861-php-developers-options-only-to-start?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/custex/jobs/38861-php-developers-options-only-to-start?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>PHP Developers -

We're self-funded and doing this for 6.5 years. We believe in what we do, and are committed to the team and our value proposition. We give back plenty but are not able to compensate interns financially.</p><p>RiteKit interns share insights on the team, experience, career boosts: <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a></p><p>At our core:<br>&quot;Enhance&quot;: this feature is the gem at the center the RiteBoost automation dashboard and RiteForge, the social publishing SaaS. </p><p>The customer's customized &quot;Enhance&quot; does any/all of the following in one click: <br>• semantically determines topics of a post and auto-hashtags them for current and historical engagement <br>• Auto-emojify<br>• converts URLs in social posts to a custom tiny URL with a baked-in advertisement<br>• if the words in your post are not good as hashtags, Enhance adds up to two at the end of the post<br>• extracts a good image from images embedded in the body of a page, if the page's URL is in your post<br>• optional: highlight text or add &quot;quotes&quot; around text before Enhancing - this makes an image from the text, with a customer-branded image background.<br>• author attribution<br>• even more options are available</p><p>We serve enterprise customers, too: <a href='https://ritekit.com/api-demo' rel='nofollow'>https://ritekit.com/api-demo</a></p><p>We're growing fast, gaining traction, we're going big, and all the while, our culture continues to improve. No one works &quot;for&quot; RiteKit; we listen, mentor, involve people in the decision making. We work &quot;with&quot; people not above them. Please feel welcome to ask any of us to explain what the difference means to to them. See Hashtag Academy in Medium to see their interviews and read what they say about our impact on careers.</p><p>What do our interns do after us? Search RiteTag in LinkedIn, then do an advanced  search to see the people. Our interns either join the team or have moved on to PopSugar, Google, Snapchat and so on.</p><p>Our four SaaS products in 60 seconds: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to RiteKit</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to RiteKit</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>All RiteKit internships are unpaid. If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. </p><p>FIRM REQUIREMENTS:<br>•  64 bit Mac / Macbook / Hackintosh core i7 preferred<br>•  Must write clean, re-usable code (we will test you)<br>•  3 months X 20 hours/week commitment<br>•  Our internships are UNPAID. No salary, no stipend, etc. <br>•  Desire to work in a startup environment, able to self-manage and work remotely* <br>•  Must have built at least two Android and/or iOS apps with Flutter<br>•  Git experience<br>* Remotely = you would work as we all do, from home or where we live.</p><p>Beneficial but not required:<br>•  Fluency with Java<br>•  Basic understanding of Android extensions/custom keyboards<br>•  TDD/Testing frameworks awareness (JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, etc.)</p><p>We greatly limit the number of interns we work with in each division. Applications are now being taken for start dates 1~3 months from now.</p><p>Hashtags, yay!</p><p>No, that's not what we do. </p><p>So, what DO we do? <br>Data-driven, machine learning-infused social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>• Total social media optimization - avoid paying for ads by intelligently automating everything shared to social with images, GIFs, emojis, influencer-tagging. Come up in social search, get curated and republished, and make a visual impact as well.<br>•  Hashtags that are recommended based on current engagement and outcomes, rather than whether they are &quot;trending&quot; (trending = many accounts sending posts with a hashtag; it says nothing about positive outcomes).<br> <br>What you will experience:<br>•  Building both Android and iOS applications with Flutter<br>•  Learn from mentors and peer feedback in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>•  Brainstorm and implement app features<br>•  Build the fully functional app from start to finish<br>•  Exposure to Rest APIs<br>•  We make you part of the process, so you can earn how to bootstrap your own startup, in case you want to do that<br>•  We ship fast - and with over 250,000 registrations, when put your latest feature into production, your work will be seen and become part of the workflow for thousands of business people.<br> <br>* As a self-funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends who have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time. Should you be selected for a first interview, please do ask what our interns go on to do, either as RiteKit salaried staff or after RiteKit. We'll give you ways to research this.</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Java, Android, Git, Mac OS X, Dart, TDD,

Kraken’s clients also trade US dollars, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Japanese yen and other digital currencies, including ether, on a platform consistently rated the best and most secure bitcoin exchange by independent news media. &nbsp; <br><br>Founded in 2011, Kraken was the first bitcoin exchange to have its market data displayed on the Bloomberg Terminal, the first to pass a cryptographically verifiable proof-of-reserves audit, a partner in the first cryptocurrency bank, and one of the first exchanges to offer leveraged bitcoin margin trading. Kraken is trusted by hundreds of thousands of traders, institutions, and authorities across the world, from Toyko’s court-appointed trustee to Germany’s BaFin regulated Fidor Bank. In January 2016, Kraken announced that it was acquiring prominent bitcoin exchanges Coinsetter and Cavirtex to expand into American and Canadian markets. <br><br>Kraken is backed by investors including SBI Investment, Money Partners Group, Hummingbird Ventures, Blockchain Capital, and Digital Currency Group, among others. &nbsp; <br><br>&quot;We wake up every single day determined to change the world by delivering a great exchange.

They are at the heart of our company and drive everything we do. We believe in having a laser focus when pursuing our strategic goals and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution.

We take pride in a neat codebase with automated tests and continuous integration, and encourage constant refactoring. We encourage new ideas and experimentation. No part of the code base is off limits.</p><p>Our current technologies include modern versions of Ember, React, TypeScript, ASP.NET MVC, C#, and F#. We also rely on tools such as AWS, GitHub, TeamCity, Octopus Deploy, Sumo Logic, Datadog, and New Relic. We don’t expect you to have experience with everything in this list, and we’ll help you learn what you don’t know!</p><p>As a front-end engineer at Olo, you will play a significant and visible role in helping us build one of the most advanced food ordering platforms in the hospitality industry. You will help us shape the digital guest experience for restaurant brands served by Olo. You will contribute to technology selection, architecture and user experience for our front-end applications.</p><p>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experience building user interfaces that put users first and look and feel awesome to use</li><li>Deep knowledge of ES6/ES2015+ and one or more modern Javascript frameworks, with a preference for React or Ember</li><li>Demonstrable understanding of the full .NET web stack</li><li>Leadership experience that spans one or more aspects of technology selection, architecture and design oversight, and mentoring others</li><li>Superb problem solving skills with an emphasis on pragmatism, quality, and performance</li><li>Passion for learning new skills and technologies</li><li>Excellent collaboration skills</li><li>BS degree in a technical field of study, or equivalent practical experience</li><li>Working proficiency and communication skills in verbal and written English</li><li>Legal right to work in the U.S</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://olo.applytojob.com/apply/AzhBQUv0Ml/FrontEnd-Engineer-JavaScript-NET' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Olo</h3>            <div><p>Olo reaches millions of consumers by powering mobile and online ordering for many of the country’s largest restaurant chains. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.</p><p>We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller. &nbsp;We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

If you love building beautiful experiences, architecting scaleable solutions for different languages and territories and optimising to make sure you get the best results, this is the role for you. </p><p>We are a small team so it’s important that the successful candidate isn’t just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit.

We value your skills more than how long you’ve worked on an application, or whether or not you have a Computer Science degree. We don’t care how you’ve acquired those skills, or how long it took you—as a Senior Software Engineer, you should be able to demonstrate a high degree of expertise.</p><p><strong>Bonus qualifications<br></strong></p><p>As we’re working with a lot of newer technology, we don’t expect you to be fully-versed with our entire tech stack, but you should have some experience in a few of these technologies, exposure to several, and a willingness to learn new skills as necessary:</p><ul><li>Experience designing, developing, documenting, securing, and/or consuming a GraphQL API using Relay or Apollo</li><li>Experience developing inclusive, accessible applications, including experience with accessibility (a11y), internationalization (i18n), and localization (l10n)</li><li>Using MongoDB at Scale</li><li>Experience developing event-driven applications using software such as Kafka</li><li>Functional programming experience</li><li>Programming in a JVM language such as Clojure, or Scala</li></ul><ul><li>Experience developing commerce or logistics software</li><li>Experience developing and deploying containerized applications using Docker and/or Kubernetes</li><li>Experience developing with Elasticsearch or other search engine technology</li><li>Previous contributions to open source projects</li><li>Experience with Kafka</li><li>Experience using Clojure</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Characteristics</strong></strong></p><p>As a distributed team building open source software, we understand that being a great software engineer is much more than having a deep technical skillset.

Candidates who don’t submit the necessary information will not be considered.<br><br>If we decide to move forward with your application, we’ll schedule a 30-45 minute screening video call via Zoom to learn more about your interests, talk about the role, and determine if Reaction Commerce is a mutual fit</p><p>We’ll then have a series of technical interviews. The first interview will be a technical conversation where we’ll discuss previous experience and work to uncover how your skill set might fill a need at Reaction Commerce.</p><p>Following the technical interview we’ll have one or more interviews focused on collaboratively solving problems with members of the engineering team. These interviews will involve writing code in a remote pair-programming type of scenario.</p><p>Finally, if appropriate based on location, we’ll conduct an onsite interview so that you’ll have the opportunity to meet key stakeholders on the team. If we can’t do this in person, we’ll arrange it as a video call.</p><p>At the offer stage, you will learn more about compensation, equity range, and benefits. While the entire process can take 4-6 weeks total depending on schedule availability, we’re committed to communicating progress frequently so you won’t be left wondering about the status of your application. We look forward to meeting you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/197466?reset=False&amp;ra=14dSWOlaMuDm&amp;oqs=a%3D14dSWOlaMuDm' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>            <h3>About Reaction Commerce</h3>            <div><p>At Reaction Commerce, we believe that the best results comes from shared ideas.

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.</p><p>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list.</p><p><strong>What You Will Be Doing</strong></p><p>You will be part of the development team building our content management system(CMS) that powers our mobile and web applications. &nbsp;You will get to come to work everyday knowing you are helping educate millions of people all around the world.</p><p><strong>Who We Are Looking For</strong></p><p>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone <strong>bright</strong> with a proven track record in developing software for high <strong>quality</strong>, <strong>scalable</strong> applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.</p><p>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team. Through our hiring process we’ve determined that there are really only a few must-haves to pass the bar:</p><ul><li>You understand Computer Science fundamentals such as data structures/algorithms</li><li>You have a passion for continuous learning and improvement</li><li>You are a seasoned JavaScript developer and have a solid knowledge of modern JS frameworks.</li></ul><p>Other things that are helpful to know are Vue.js, Postgres, Heroku and Rails.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p>While our offices are in Coralville, Iowa, our developers work wherever they want. We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.</p><p><strong>What We Pay</strong></p><p>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a <em>&quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; </em>stance on vacation and PTO.</p><p><strong>How To Apply</strong></p><p>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:</p><ul><li>Your github username</li><li>A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a web app, node package or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!</li></ul><p>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.</p><p><strong>Life at HLT</strong></p><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><ul><li>Remote working</li><li>Flexible hours</li><li>Large amounts of autonomy</li><li>Great pay, insurance, benefits</li></ul><p><strong>So Why HLT?</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in</p><ul><li>Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks</li><li>Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education</li><li>A fast paced and fun work environment</li><li>A career with a higher purpose</li></ul><p>Then we we would love to talk to you!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/196220?reset=False&amp;ra=13NYEKqt7OyA&amp;oqs=a%3D13NYEKqt7OyA' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Large amounts of autonomy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great pay, insurance, benfits</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

They were spending days sending out RFQs, waiting for feedback, sending drawings, asking for different quantities, waiting for more feedback, only to receive back less than optimal pricing and lead times. We also knew that designers were not always fully aware of the capabilities and limitations of the latest manufacturing technology advances.</p><p>Second, we heard frustration from machine shops, who were spending a lot of time and energy responding to inquiries for custom parts that ultimately did not happen. In addition, without extensive sales and marketing resources, many of these shops were limited to working with customers in their local area, making it difficult to grow their business.</p><p>At Xometry, we created a proprietary software platform to enable product designers and engineers to instantly access the capacity of a nationwide network of manufacturing facilities. Our platform makes it possible for customers to receive instant pricing, expected lead times and manufacturability feedback. At the push of a button, the network is able to deliver high quality parts at consistently fast lead times while offering very low prices.</p><p>We make it easy for all customers — from startups to Fortune 100 companies — to access manufacturing on demand by providing the most efficient way to source high-quality custom parts. We’re dedicated to keeping more manufacturing in America by providing an innovative way for customers to easily work with facilities across the country.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vacation Time</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Snacks</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Otions</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Happy hours and team events</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

We're growing steadily and to meet new demands, we’re developing new products that busy city staffers (and our own business) do and will rely on to make their cities better for their citizens. Candidates must have a passion for getting things done and be highly motivated. Candidates must thrive in an entrepreneurial environment and be eager to learn and contribute to the team setting. Ideally, we are seeking a Central-NJ based candidate.</p><p>This position is for a full-time, Software Engineer, who will work semi-autonomously and as a part of a small, but growing, team to design, implement, test, deploy, and maintain web-based, back-office software which runs our business, as well as significant portions of our customers' as well as on-the-street (usually literally) mobile software.</p><p>Our biggest challenges are, by design, behind the scenes, and experienced by our clients (the cities) and our own mobile workforce. We're not so much worried about achieving &quot;web scale&quot; as we are about making people's jobs and lives easier. And if we can add at least dash of whimsy in there, too, all the better!</p><p>PayLock helps cities with those &quot;necessary evil&quot; parts of city governance. We try to make those things less evil, both for the people doing them and the people having them done to them.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Candidates must have: great communication abilities (after all, we're a&nbsp;service company, and you'll inevitably be talking to customers), great problem solving skills, an insatiable curiosity and ability to learn, and an innate commitment to getting things done—or, more precisely, an innate need to not let things go undone. And a sense of humor doesn't hurt, either.</p><p>For starters, you'll need a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Design. Developers on our team also work on and develop database schemas, so you should have experience (and proficiency) with that as well. Since most of what we're doing is web-based, you've gotta know some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and knowing how the Internet works work can't hurt you. If you understand that much, you probably know a lot about many other things and are constantly adding to your repertoire. In fact, you might not even be able to stop yourself. That's a characteristic we really, really dig: fast, eager, creative learners.</p><p>The kinds of things you might find yourself working on are:</p><ol><li>Building and/or extending a RESTful web api for an AngularJS web application</li><li>Designing and building business management tools (to help our business and our clients')--things like dashboards, alerts, and other &quot;knowledge radiators&quot;</li><li>Building and/or rebuilding a data movement pipeline (we do lots of data integrations with our clients and other 3rd parties)</li><li>Mobile apps for our in-the-field and on-the-road workforce</li><li>Tools for us, the developers, to make our own lives easier</li></ol><p>It's also important that you can keep two visions alive: the near-term and the long-term. We find ourselves juggling the needs of the business (often the near-term voice) and the needs of ourselves and the systems and applications we own on the business' behalf. You have to be strong enough to deliver on the near-term objectives while putting in that extra 10% to 20% of effort to accomplish our long-term (i.e. 3-year) objectives. You have to be ok with taking the hard road sometimes, and trust that it'll be worth it (we think it is).</p><p>Repeat after me: Refactoring is my friend. I will leave everything I work on better than I found it.</p><p>As a growing company, there are plenty of opportunities to pitch in, learn, and develop professionally, and help us&nbsp;reach new levels of greatness, and we're looking for folks who like the sound of that. Drop us a line if you're that person.</p><p># years experience required: years of experience!</p><p>WHEN APPLYING, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE INCLUDE A PARAGRAPH OR TWO ABOUT WHAT MAKES YOU TICK OR WHAT YOU'RE PASSIONATE ABOUT--RESUMES AREN'T ENOUGH TO GO ON.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/16080?reset=False&amp;ra=5olFkXF3SeI&amp;oqs=a%3D5olFkXF3SeI' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About PayLock</h3>            <div><p>We are profitable AND well-funded 10+ year-old &quot;post-startup&quot; company focused on improving the current options available to municipalities, universities, and the parking enforcement community to quickly, easily, and humanely manage their ever-increasing challenges in parking enforcement--like collecting overdue parking tickets and managing limited parking real-estate while reducing costs. We offer them technologies and services which allow them to do their jobs quickly, easily, and much less painfully than ever before. And we are introducing cutting-edge tools, services and technologies that are literally changing the way people think about parking—from City Hall, which is passing legislation to allow it, to the officers on the street, who are enforcing those laws.

You ensure optimal user convenience of our website for our customers. You create a blazing fast and solid code that is well-structured and documented.</p><p><strong>Goals of our Firebase Developer</strong></p><p>Within your first weeks, you understand our repositories and the concept of our code base. You know the structure and grasp the what's, where's and why's of our code. You know the code and understand the underlying parts and foundations. You know our focus points. You will <strong>build your first tested and user-ready part of our webshop or cloud function</strong> from scratch by using internal and external API's. You receive approval from the users or collegues and feel hungry for more.</p><p>Within the first months you will be able to elaborate a complete subproject, consisting of new and existing cloud functionalities, <strong>from idea to operational product</strong>. Throughout the process, you communicate efficiently with all stakeholders to ensure that the result meets the demands and goals of the project. You make suggestions to improve working conditions and tools so that everybody can work in a more efficient and enjoyable way.</p><p>On the longer term, you will learn to <strong>manage the entire code base</strong>. You give shape to the building tools&nbsp;and manage large parts of the frontend - and possible also backend - webapps. You can easily respond to the needs and demands of the team.</p><p><strong>Skills and competencies</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Goal-driven</strong> - You are result-driven, focused, realistic and resourceful.</li><li><strong>Responsible</strong> - Most of the time you will work on your own. You have enough self-discipline to always go the extra mile for Pit&amp;Pit. You don't need anybody who directs or motivates you.</li><li><strong>Persistent</strong> - You are motivated and have a heart for Pit&amp;Pit. You are a go-getter. The possibilities in IT are endless: if you can explain it, you can program it. You love challenges.</li><li><strong>Energetic</strong> - You work hard, fast-paced, are vital and always want to go forward.</li><li><strong>Good judgement</strong> - You have your own opinion based on common sense and relevant criteria. You communicate your judgment in a clear manner and are willing to re-evaluate it if necessary.</li><li><strong>Vision</strong> - You are able to think ahead, you are aware of current market trends and new developments.</li><li><strong>Pragmatic</strong> - You do not like to work according to rigorous standard rules because 'that's the way everybody does it'. However, you work very orderly and structured. You dare to think out of the box: &quot;everybody said it wasn't possible, until someone came who did not know that&quot; (which was you).</li><li><strong>Innovative</strong> - Every day new, interesting projects and new opportunities pop up. An interest in new techniques is required in order to maintain the code of Pit&amp;Pit efficient and up to date. New insights and chances energize the whole team. For this reason you have to be very efficient at putting the most suitable innovations in development into practice so that efficiency and stability are continuously improved.</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Experienced javascript developer, with demonstrable knowledge of svelte (or next.js)</li><li>Experience with the consumption&nbsp;of microservices / API's</li><li>Proactive</li><li>Independent, responsible and accountable</li><li>Energetic</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/167433?reset=False&amp;ra=U9pEBGPPbC8&amp;oqs=a%3DU9pEBGPPbC8' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Pit&amp;Pit</h3>            <div><p>We believe that everybody should be able to enjoy a healthy life.

The succes of Pit&amp;Pit stems from a unique and extensive assortiment of quality products, a continuous striving towards full customer-satisfaction, impeccable organization and sustainable business relations. At Pit&amp;Pit you will work in a young, dynamic team of ca. 40 employees and a small IT team.</p><p>At Pit&amp;Pit we enjoy working together with highly motivated people. We find it very frustrating to work in a team in which not everyone is equally dedicated. Hence you will only find top talents at Pit&amp;Pit; driven and enthousiast colleagues, full of energy and always with a big smile on their face.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Nice and friendly people to work with</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Focus on fast and solid code base</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Responsibility is rewarded</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dynamic team of highly motivated people</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours for a great fit with your life</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Kraken is trusted by hundreds of thousands of traders, institutions, and authorities across the world, from Toyko’s court-appointed trustee to Germany’s BaFin regulated Fidor Bank. In January 2016, Kraken announced that it was acquiring prominent bitcoin exchanges Coinsetter and Cavirtex to expand into American and Canadian markets. <br><br>Kraken is backed by investors including SBI Investment, Money Partners Group, Hummingbird Ventures, Blockchain Capital, and Digital Currency Group, among others. &nbsp; <br><br>&quot;We wake up every single day determined to change the world by delivering a great exchange.

Kraken is trusted by hundreds of thousands of traders, institutions, and authorities across the world, from Toyko’s court-appointed trustee to Germany’s BaFin regulated Fidor Bank.

They are at the heart of our company and drive everything we do. We believe in having a laser focus when pursuing our strategic goals and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution.

Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. Elastic is backed by $104 million in funding from Benchmark Capital, Index Ventures, and NEA; has headquarters in Amsterdam and Mountain View, California; and has employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong>Kibana is the window into the Elastic Stack</strong></p><p>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developer who wants to add to Kibana and X-Pack? We want to meet you!</p><p><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Innovate, lead and contribute to front end and visualization experience of the Kibana and other UI products using JavaScript</li><li>Collaborate with other development teams, quality engineering team, and documentation team to execute on product work</li></ul><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Strong JavaScript programming skills</li><li>7+ years of front end development work</li><li>Experience with one modern MVC style JS Framework</li><li>Experience writing automated tests</li><li>Ability to work in a fast paced start-up environment</li><li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills, a great teammate with strong analytical, problem solving, debugging and troubleshooting skills</li><li>Strong preference for operational experience</li><li>Strong preference for knowledge of building complex data visualization and related tooling</li><li>Strong preference for Open Source experience</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><ul><li>Deeply competitive pay, medical, dental, vision, disability, benefits</li><li>Stock options</li><li>Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices</li><li>An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life</li><li>Passionate people building great products</li><li>Employees with a wide variety of interests</li><li>Your age is only a number.

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p><p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</p><p>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p><ul><li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li><li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li><li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li><li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li><li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li><li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li><li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li></ul><p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p><p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p><p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p><p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Analytics Fire</h3>            <div><p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p><p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

You are likely to <strong>learn and grow as a developer</strong> while working here.</li><li>Our pay and benefits will be somewhere between good and great, depending on what you are used to and where you live (see below for specifics).</li><li>You will have the option of <strong>working from home or our office</strong>, whatever suits you best. Let’s make the most of our time and minimize commuting when not necessary.</li><li>We have a no-drama office policy. We value and cultivate enjoyable working relationships among team members.</li><li>We emphasize work/life balance and adopt policies that make sure our people don’t get burnt out. For instance, our PTO/Vacation policies are <strong>designed so that you actually use them.</strong></li><li>A commitment to Agile Principles while not being enslaved to any particular methodology.</li><li>You have the skills and experience to be a mid-level or senior level full-stack web application developer. That is, you need to be able to architect &amp; run with a medium sized project mostly on your own.</li><li>You like building full stack web applications with technologies like Python, React, SQL, etc.</li><li>You are <strong>committed to automated testing</strong> of all the software you write (our apps typically have 92%+ test coverage).</li><li>You recognized that there is a lot of idealism in the software development community and are not disenchanted with the the <a href='https://ukiahsmith.com/blog/programming-is-terrible-so-learn-to-enjoy-it/' rel='nofollow'>day-to-day realities of programming</a>.</li><li>You like working independently but can contribute to a team as needed</li><li>If you apply, we will give you a yay or nay response. No black holes here!</li></ul><p><strong>Daily Responsibilities</strong></p><p>Daily responsibilities primarily consist of coding database-driven web applications and other web-related development work. In a typical day, you will likely work mostly with Python based web applications using frameworks like Django or Flask that interact heavily with a database (PostgreSQL or MSSQL).&nbsp; In the course of that work, you will have to interact with related technologies like JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS/SASS.</p><p>This is not a design job. It will require a lot of in-depth programming and database work including the ability to architect maintainable code that gets the job done.</p><p>While we do prefer to do most of our back-end work in Python, we will occasionally take projects in other languages if they seem to be a good fit for us and the customer.</p><p>Some days you will jump from project to project as issues come up. At other times you may work primarily on one project for weeks or months.</p><p>The ability to take ownership for a project, engineer a sound technical solution, and “drive” a project to completion is <strong>essential</strong>.</p><p>Our customers have varied needs and so we tend to have varied responsibilities and projects. We have a focus on serving the customer and making software conform to their company rather than making the company conform to software.</p><p>We run our teams (two currently) in two week sprints.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Pay: $75-$100K (mid-level), $100K-125K (Senior/Lead).<br><ul><li>We are happy to talk about money as one of the first parts of our conversation so we don’t waste each others time if we aren’t in the ballpark.</li><li>Everyone wants to be paid as much as possible, but the economics of business usually require that we meet in the middle.</li><li>Our offer will take into consideration your salary history, experience, references, and a skills assessment.</li></ul></li><li>Profit Sharing: In addition to a salary, our employees will earn a bonus based on how profitable our company is each year (roughly $1-2K annually).</li><li>One of the best things about working for us is that we really value work/family balance.<ul><li>We rarely work more than 40 hours a week.</li><li>We recently gave everyone an extra day off for Valentine’s Day just for extra quality time with their family.</li><li>We know there are devs out there putting in 50-60 hours a week. We can give them 10-20 hours a week of their life back.</li></ul></li><li>PTO/Vacation:<ul><li>Everyone receives 3 weeks of PTO/Vacation per year.</li><li>Up to 12 sick days per year.</li><li>9 Holidays</li></ul></li><li>Healthcare: We contribute to an HRA to offset the cost of health insurance or healthcare expenses.</li><li>Flexibility: While we expect a regular schedule during normal business hours, we are pretty flexible when schedule changes are needed for legitimate reasons.</li><li><strong>Telecommuting</strong>:<ul><li>Remote candidates are welcome to apply.</li><li>Many of us work from home frequently, even those of us who are local.</li><li>We do have an office if you prefer to get away from home to focus on work.</li></ul></li><li>We Care: It’s easy to say, harder to do. We all need to make a living, our company needs to be successful in the marketplace, and hard decisions sometimes need to be made. But, at the end of the day, we really care about our employees, their families, their needs, and their desires.</li></ul><p><strong>Full Job Description &amp; Application Instructions<br></strong></p><p>Above are just highlights. The full job description for both positions are on our website and includes salary information, videos, and instructions on applying: <a href='https://level12.io/careers/' rel='nofollow'>https://level12.io/careers/</a></p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p><strong>Character First</strong></p><p>Level 12 is <a href='https://www.level12.io/about/' rel='nofollow'>founded on biblical principles</a> and has biblically informed goals. Accordingly, the reputation of Level 12 and the character of our employees is of utmost importance. You <strong>do not</strong> need to share our leadership's religious convictions, but you will need to share our commitment to the following principles:</p><ul><li><strong>Integrity</strong>: honest, trustworthy, reliable, ethical. We have high moral standards and we expect our employees to share those standards. If you use pirated software or media, don’t mind “tweaking” the truth, or think `porn == entertainment`, this is not the job for you!</li><li><strong>Good work ethic</strong>: you work hard and like to work hard. You also work efficiently, seeking to make the best use of your time.</li><li><strong>Dedicated</strong>: you really desire to contribute to and improve our company; you are not just earning a paycheck. You demonstrate a high level of “ownership” for and initiative with projects that are assigned to you.</li><li><strong>Teachable</strong>: you have a willingness and desire for feedback/correction. You are always looking to improve. You are willing to ask for help even if it makes you “look bad.”</li><li><strong>Resourceful</strong>: you know how to solve problems or are at least able to explain that the problem is not solvable with the requirements given. You use all resources at your disposal in an efficient manner to troubleshoot. You know when to ask someone for help and when more effort is needed on your part.</li><li><strong>Technical Prowess</strong>: you just “get” programming, computers, technology.

No-Bullshit-iest Way We Can Describe This Job In The Least Amount Of Words In A Run-On Sentence: </strong></p><p>We build a lot of different kinds of stuff for a lot of different kinds of folks (<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/work/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/work/</a>) at a shop that is big enough to bite off important, meaningful work and small enough to have fun doing it and we’re looking for an engineer who is equally at ease talking to clients, designers, producers, and developers about things like scope, resource allocation, solutions to engineering problems, creative ideas for how to build things, ways to articulate technical complexity to normal business humans...and occasionally...cut some code.</p><p><strong>Here’s What We Think You Probably Need to Be Successful At This Job: </strong></p><ul><li>Have agency experience, leading a development team spread across multiple projects and clients.</li><li>Hands on developer and leader</li><li>Are comfortable reviewing project specifications, collaborating with company leadership to develop project estimates and technical specs</li><li>Experienced in code reviews to adhere to best practices and internal standards, providing feedback and following up on remediation</li><li>You have an ear to the ground for new tech, whether it comes from hacker news or a programming subreddit, and a desire to dive in and try it out.</li><li>Experience in architecting and building bespoke custom WordPress themes using Advanced Custom Fields, Gravity Forms, Yoast with custom integrations to third party systems.</li><li>Experience in client and server-side debugging, performance profiling and optimization techniques with an uncanny intuition for finding the cause and solution</li><li>Experience with integration of analytics, a/b testing, and advertising platforms using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Planning out projects in coordination with Project Manager/Producer and Developer team members, participating in project check-ins providing feedback to the team</li><li>Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals</li><li>Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA</li><li>Comfortable working with small projects (1 dev) and medium projects (2-3 devs)</li><li>Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation</li><li>Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI</li><li>Comfortable in architecting and implementation of APIs in PHP/Laravel, NodeJS/Express and other similar stacks.</li><li>Attention to detail and a seamless user experience. &nbsp;This means making the product look like the design and working with your team to make it smooth and perfect.</li><li>You have real-world experience with React. &nbsp;AngularJS knowledge might be transferable, but React is what we're looking for.</li><li>jQuery is &quot;nice to have&quot; but NOT necessary in your arsenal. &nbsp;You respect the finer points of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear.

We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.<br><br></p><p><strong>BENEFITS</strong></p><ul><li>Work with an extremely talented, diverse team</li><li>Equipment of your choice</li><li>Remote-friendly</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Flexible vacation policy</li><li>Annual company gathering in an international location - this year, Barcelona in October</li><li>We send you hardware for side projects!</li></ul>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

You’ll be an integral part of our engineering team focused on building and scaling a world-class product.</p><p>We do things a little differently here at Knack, and that’s just how we like it:</p><p>* Flat: we don’t have project managers or dictates from a CTO. Each engineer is lead on multiple projects and is expected to make major decisions.<br>* Autonomous: our engineers own their projects, collectively determine technical implementation, and have the freedom to define how they can maximize their impact.<br>* Engaged: our engineers think of their job as more than just 1s and 0s. Only by engaging with our product, our customers, and our team can they be fully equipped to do their best work.<br>* Remote: to make this work our engineers are great communicators and are highly involved with hangouts/chat/discussions around both engineering topics and larger company issues.</p><p>This isn’t for everyone, but for the right fit this will be the definitive experience of your career. Our goal will be to ensure you are driven and supported to continuously grow and do your best work.</p><p>This is a senior position, so we’re looking for a strong track record of shipping code and building products at scale. With that said, we’re not looking for a 100% match on experience or our stack. If you have a history of shipping solid work, we’re interested.</p><p>About the Job</p><p>Our senior engineers are ultimately responsible for delivering an outstanding product. This includes:<br>* Implementing and architecting new features.<br>* Optimizing our systems for performance, including speed, reliability, redundancy, and geographic distribution.<br>* Fixing bugs and issues.<br>* Working with our success team to address customer issues and concerns.<br>* Building tools and processes to improve our operations and help us detect and respond to issues.</p><p>How you’ll do this:</p><p>* Program: ship code every day<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing features that have been specified to death. It includes developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we have enough areas of need where we want to leverage what you're excited about and use that to make Knack a better product.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and actively engage in chat to constantly teach and learn.</p><p>You won’t have a direct boss but will be working collaboratively with our current engineering team of 10, and with cross-functional teams on specific projects.</p><p>Our work is 100% remote. We use Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done.</p><p>*Our stack*</p><p>AWS - we’ve drunk the kool-aid and use AWS across the board.<br>Node.js - APIs<br>MongoDB, Redis, MariaDB - data persistence<br>Vue.js, Backbone - our front-end is largely raw JavaScript/jQuery/Backbone, currently migrating to Vue.js.<br>Github, Jenkins, Webpack - deployment<br>Ghost Inspector, Sentry, LogRocket - testing</p><p>*About You*</p><p>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.</p><p>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.</p><p>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.</p><p>You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.</p><p>*About Knack*</p><p>Knack is a no-code platform that makes it easy for anyone to build applications and workflows to do amazing things with their data.</p><p>Knack launched in 2012 and has been growing steadily as we’ve built our team, perfected our product, and nailed our product-market fit. We’re now ready to take things to the next level and maximize the opportunity for what this product can be.</p><p>*Benefits &amp; Compensation*</p><p>Competitive salaries and generous equity: rather than give up equity to investors to pay engineering salaries, we’ve chosen to give more of that equity to our team while still paying strong salaries.</p><p>Define your work: our only rule is our overlap zone of 11am to 4pm EST. Otherwise find the location, environment, and schedule that is best for your life and work.</p><p>Unlimited Paid Vacation: take the time you need to stay motivated, charged, and balanced. </p><p>Paid Corporate Retreats: we get together twice a year at amazing locations to do normal human being things in person. We pay for your flight, lodging, and meals.</p><p>Learning Credits: an annual allowance is provided to stay on top of your game with classes, books, and conferences.</p><p>HealthCare: we offer health, vision, and dental, covering 75% of the premium for you and your dependents (spouse + children).</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Javascript, SQL, Big Data, MongoDB, Node.js, MariaDB, Vue.Js</div><div>Compensation</div><div>$90K–$125K<br>0.5%–2.5%</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Knack</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/147889-devops-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/147889-devops-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>DevOps Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/147889-devops-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Knack</a></div><div>Remote, United States</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/72947-frontend-vue-js-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/72947-frontend-vue-js-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Frontend Vue.js Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knack/jobs/72947-frontend-vue-js-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Knack</a></div><div>Earth, United States</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/325636-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/325636-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front End Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/gitcoin/jobs/325636-front-end-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Gitcoin</a></div><div>Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/klinify/jobs/293821-web-developer-full-time-remote?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/klinify/jobs/293821-web-developer-full-time-remote?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Web Developer (Full-time remote)</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/klinify/jobs/293821-web-developer-full-time-remote?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>klinify</a></div><div>Singapore</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knock-7/jobs/320477-front-end-engineer-remote-in-us?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/knock-7/jobs/320477-front-end-engineer-remote-in-us?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Front End Engineer -

The last two trips were to Lisbon/Cascais and Paris!<br><br><br><br>⭐️ **What you will do: **⭐️<br><br>• You will be our web app’s interior designer.<br><br>• You will be responsible both for our public site’s and the web app’s frontend code, through layout, elegant presentation, visual functionality, and compatibility across a wide range of browser versions and form factors.<br><br>• You will be in charge of completely overhauling our legacy, spaghetti frontend javascript into a unified, beautifully-structured, and testable web app.<br><br>• You will take charge of your own work and proactively suggest improvements.<br><br>• In a remote environment you will be responsible for your own time and results – there will be no babysitting.<br><br><br><br>✅ **What you will need to succeed:** ✅<br><br>• UX Geek: you know how to strike the right balance between swanky animation and Zen-like simplicity to drive great user experiences.<br><br>• Independent: you are self-motivated, take initiative, and are a strong communicator. You are results-driven and willing to learn and improve yourself.<br><br>• Technical Ninja: proficient at vanilla Javascript and PHP, Vue.js 2.x or Angular 4/5/6, Twig/Blade/Handlebars templating, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3 (all the good stuff), semantic/schema markup, LESS/SCSS, Webpack and/or Gulp, and Git, backed by 5+ years of frontend development experience.<br><br>• Interface Artisan: you can clearly describe data structure requirements as well as points of entry for your frontend code, enabling other developers to integrate their frontend and backend code painlessly.<br><br>• Caring Developer: you recognise that your code and work impact not only the customers but also the rest of the team. You conduct yourself with professionalism and respect not only in meetings but also in how you structure your code and in the documentation that you write.<br><br>• Superb English fluency: we are an international team and clear communication is vital. It goes without saying (but we’ll say it anyway) that you absolutely must have the ability to participate in frequent video meetings.<br><br>• The product team is based in Europe, so at the moment we are looking for developers who are based within the same general time zones (UTC±3). <br><br><br><br> **Brownie points:** <br><br>• You have experience with unit and automated functionality testing of frontend code using tools like Jasmine, Karma, Chai, Selenium, PhantomJS, and/or Sinon.<br><br>• Interactive Git rebasing doesn’t sound like voodoo to you.<br><br>• You’ve used in Git commit messages.<br><br>• You’re pretty darn good at interface design and color palettes.<br><br>• Typescript experience.<br><br>(Let us know how many  you deserve.)<br><br><br><br> **What we offer:** <br><br>• Competitive salary, including the possibility of stock options.<br><br>• Ample paid leave, in addition to maternity and paternity leave.<br><br>• A great support structure: we are here for you.<br><br>• Flexible contract. You will work independently where you are most productive and happiest, with flexible weekday hours.<br><br>• All the resources and tools that you need to succeed <br><br>• Join a fast-growing startup and be part of the force that shapes the company in the years to come!<br><h2>Requirements</h2>We are solving global short-term rental automation.

We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</span><br><br></li><li><span>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</span><br><br></li><li><span>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</span><br><br></li><li><span>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</span><br><br></li><li><span>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</span><br><br></li><li><span>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</span><br><br></li><li><span>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</span><br><br></li></ul><div><span>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc).

You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h2><span>About Analytics Fire</span></h2></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

    "content": "This is a unique opportunity to become an influential member of a small engineering team located in Shepherd's Bush in West London. You will enjoy all of the benefits of working in a startup, the freedom to innovate, to explore new technologies and to use your experience and ideas to directly influence the business.<br /><br />*---- Why ClickMechanic ----*<br /><br />ClickMechanic is a marketplace for vehicle repairs. Our platform enables customers to acquire real-time industry-standard quotes for repairs (a first in Europe), services and diagnostics, and quickly book a vetted mechanic online. Our mission is to bring trust and transparency to car repair.<br /><br />Founded in 2012, the company has grown quickly to offer nationwide coverage and is backed by such institutional investors as 500 Startups and Forward Partners, and angel investors including the former CEO of JustEat and Chairman of Treatwell.<br /><br />Vehicle repair is a huge market, ripe for technology disruption. There are millions of consumers, tera- or even peta-bytes of potentially underused data, with an exceptional logistics infrastructure (parts distribution).<br /><br />*---- The Role ----*<br /><br />As a full-stack developer in a small team, you will work across all aspects of the product from architecture and DevOps to code reviews and tech support. Working alongside our CTO & Head of Engineering, you will deliver new features and continually improve our existing code.<br /><br />Technology underpins our entire business. We’ve built an industry-leading quote engine and mobile Mechanic App. We consume millions of rows of third-party automotive data and have implemented machine learning to improve the accuracy of our quotes.<br /><br />*---- Responsibilities ----*<br /><br />* Writing well-tested production code in Ruby and JavaScript.<br />* Refactoring and rearchitecting legacy code where appropriate to ensure you always leave it better than you found it.<br />* Reviewing code fairly and honestly; and receiving code reviews openly on each of your pull requests.<br />* Collaboration with business stakeholders to develop requirements and expectations.<br />* Collaboration with technical stakeholders to discuss constraints and opportunities.<br />* Monitoring our production systems and providing technical support to the business.<br />* Maintaining our development pipeline and toolchain.<br />* Innovation and self-led learning.<br /><br />*---- Our Technology ----*<br /><br />As a startup, we prefer open-source technologies. Our main app is built with Ruby (on Rails) and is hosted on Heroku and AWS. We use both PostgreSQL and SQL Server relational databases and also MongoDB and Elasticsearch NoSQL databases.<br /><br />Our mobile Mechanic App is built on JQuery mobile and we are planning to rearchitect this system onto a more modern framework (e.g. React) soon.<br /><br />Our development pipeline utilises Jira, Git, GitHub, Docker, Webpack, Grunt and CircleCI.<br /><br />*---- Requirements ----*<br /><br />Your potential is much more important to us than a list of characteristics. Nevertheless, here is a list of characteristics that we hope already apply to you, or that you’re very keen to develop:<br />* You consider yourself fairly expert in at least one OO programming language (not necessarily Ruby).<br />* You have built a production web application using an MVC (or equivalent) framework (e.g. Ruby on Rails).<br />* The terms OOP, SOLID and TDD make you feel warm inside.<br />* You can write complicated SQL statements directly in the console without a query designer.<br />* Unix, Linux, Heroku, GitHub and NoSQL are not just made-up words to you.<br />* You can describe JavaScript as a functional, prototypal language and know what that means.<br />* You have strong Git-fu and can perform interactive rebases from the command line.<br />* You’re not afraid to get stuck into DevOps and have a go at, say, implementing Docker in a CI pipeline.<br />* You write your best code when pair-programming with another developer regardless of their experience.<br />* You wouldn't write a line of production code without writing a failing test first, because that’s how it’s done, right?<br />* You read about programming and technology because it’s a passion, not just a profession.<br />* You see legacy code as an exciting opportunity to innovate and make things better.<br /><br />*---- Benefits ----*<br /><br />* Working with leading open-source technologies in an agile team.<br />* A culture that embraces flexibility, and rewards growth and innovation.<br />* The opportunity to directly contribute to the success of the business every day.<br />* A competitive package including company pension and share options.<br />* MacBook Pro as standard.<br />* 10% innovation time.<br />* Manage your own training budget.<br />* Tea, coffee, fruit, snacks and Friday beers provided!<br />* Bringing trust and transparency to an industry which is widely recognised for high levels customer dissatisfaction."

The potential outcome to these types of collaborations are unlimited and exciting to us.  Secondly, farmers can easily manage their animal records and expenses/income through our SaaS-based management software.  This software will be a continual improvement process and will develop according to farmers' needs. Thirdly, we provide a variety of ways to buy/sell animals, food products, and farm related products such as hay, farm equipment, farm vehicles, real estate, etc. In addition to these services, we also allow animal transporters to use the site and offer transportation services.

    "content": "Join a small JavaScript development team within a successful business about to embark on its next phase of growth.<br /><br />* Lead and coach a small team of developers, whilst also contributing.<br />* Working on a varied 3 year roadmap for in-house products, including FLG (sales lead management) and Flow XO (chatbots and messaging).<br />* Our team is focused on JavaScript across the full stack.<br /><br />**Who we are**<br /><br />We're a B2B (SaaS) technology business established just over 10 years ago. Since then, our growth has been steady and organic, and we've built a great business with several £million in annual revenue and very healthy profits.<br /><br />A few years ago we launched Flow XO, a business messaging and chatbots product. Flow XO is already a leader in its market with users all over the world.<br /><br />**Our plan for growth**<br /><br />We're now working on a 3 year plan to accelerate our growth and bring the FLG and Flow XO products closer together.<br /><br />The foundations are there - strong history, good revenues, excellent profits, amazing people in both the team and customers.<br /><br />Our plans include a new focus on sales and marketing, and a revamped approach to product, which will see FLG and Flow XO become an expanded product family and see new products brought into the mix.<br /><br />**The role**<br /><br />As the single lead developer and coach in the team, it will be your job to work alongside the product manager to turn product plans into well architected software products.<br /><br />About half the time you'll be managing, coaching and organising the team. The rest of the time, you'll be working on code alongside the rest of the team.<br /><br />You'll be working on both the front-end (React/Redux and Angular) and also the back-end (Node, MongoDB & Redis) plus anything else we bring into the picture for our new products. The work is challenging, as we're building complex products with interesting problems around UX, scaling, and architecture.<br /><br />Although there's obviously some complexity in the codebase, we've worked hard to reduce technical debt, achieve excellent test coverage, and follow conventions where possible. So you'll be joining projects where most of the working day is spent thinking about the future rather than catching up with the past.<br /><br />Our product roadmap means there is likely to be whole new products being actively worked on every 3-6 months, at least for the next few years.<br /><br />**Is this you?**<br /><br />* You have a few years' experience of building full-stack JavaScript web apps<br />* You currently have team leadership responsibilities and want to develop that further. We need you to lead technical discussion to collaborate with the team and nurture innovation whilst always having an eye on the commercial strategy. We also need you to act as our scrum master (or delegate the responsibility elsewhere)<br />* You want to coach and develop other members of the team around you<br />* You're engaging, approachable and pragmatic<br />* You're a great communicator<br />* Always be considering 'what if', so you can write code and design logic that is robust and secure<br /><br />If this is you, please come and join our team. Our customers need you.<br /><br />**The rewards**<br /><br />This is a rare opportunity to transform something great into something incredible.<br /><br />A chance to plot the businesses growth and point proudly to when you joined the business, just before the curve takes that sharp upwards turn.<br /><br />As well as a rewarding challenge, we also offer:<br /><br />* A very competitive salary<br />* Flexible working hours<br />* Part-time remote working available<br />* Our product team is based in Manchester City Centre in a cool office. We don't care about your gender, race, sexuality, age, whether you have disabilities we need to accommodate, etc. - we're simply looking for someone that can deliver.<br /><br />**Next steps**<br /><br />The first step is to send us your current CV and write us an intro.<br /><br />The intro is important, you need to explain (succinctly) how you fit into the picture.<br /><br />We're looking forward to hearing from you. Don't delay."

We are well funded and backed by one of the UK’s most successful tech accelerators, Entrepreneur First.</p><p>We’re developing a range of applications and technologies to record, monitor and analyse container ship cargo operations (i.e. the process of moving containers on and off a ship in port), to ensure ships depart early and consume less fuel on voyage. Our long-term goal is to bring the widespread adoption of autonomous technologies to merchant ships.</p><p>Voyages by ship are legally classed as ‘adventures’. We see CargoMate as an adventure too; driven by passionate problem solvers who are resilient when faced with a storm. We reach our destination by working as one crew.</p><p>Your Role</p><p>We care about our craft and it’s important to us that you do as well. We’re looking for someone who’s willing to learn on the job, as well as teach others. You write code that you’re proud of as you know you and your team members will be the ones maintaining and adding new features to it.</p><p>You’ll work on an Android-only React Native app that lets users on container ships across the world keep their progress up to date. Skills in Android development will come in handy as React Native has its limits.</p><p>You’ll collaborate closely with the rest of the tech team as we’ve created an initial MVP and are now looking to create a new version that’s will be used on thousands of ships. You’ll build new features, prototype new ideas, do code reviews, mentor future team members as well as have mentors around you. We keep up to date with the latest tech but know that bleeding edge usually isn’t optimal for production. You don’t have to know our whole tech stack but it’s important that you’re willing to learn.</p><p>For this role, mobile development skills and culture fit are more important than a formal education. We don’t do whiteboard interviews or ask you how many golf balls fit in a 747. You will get to show that you know what you’re doing by coding on your own machine as part of the interview process.</p><p>We’re a tight-knit team with people from many different cultures. We enjoy each other’s company and it’s therefore important that you’re a great fit for our company culture.</p><p>Remote work is an option after first spending three months in our offices in central Richmond upon Thames. Richmond offers great restaurants and walks along the Thames during breaks.</p><p>You</p><ul><li><p>Take pride in your work</p></li><li><p>Are a team player</p></li><li><p>Are always striving to learn from and teach others</p></li><li><p>Are independent with good communication and teamwork skills</p></li></ul><p>You have</p><ul><li><p>B.S. in Computer Science or equivalent work experience</p></li><li><p>Strong proficiency in Android development and experience with React Native</p></li><li><p>Experienced knowledge and understanding of the Android SDK, APIs and libraries</p></li><li><p>Experience writing unit and integration tests</p></li><li><p>Experience with CI/CD and deploying apps</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>A high level of accuracy and attention to detail</p></li></ul><p>Get in touch at crew@cargomate.co.uk.</p>"

Of course there’s plenty of flexibility and lots of opportunities to grow, but we also have share options, private health insurance, and unlimited leave (with a minimum of 5.6 weeks per year - just so everyone actually takes time off). Our CEO is (really) devoted to making Rotageek the best place to work, and so while we work really, really hard, we definitely play hard, too. And we have nice snacks, good beer, amazing team events and a roof terrace.</p><p><b>Your role</b></p><p>We're looking&nbsp;for an experienced JavaScript developer who is proficient with React.js. You’ll be responsible for developing new user-facing features and implementing them following well-known React.js workflows (such as Redux). You will ensure that these components and the overall application are robust, reusable and easy to maintain coordinating with the rest of the team working on different layers of the infrastructure. A commitment to collaborative problem solving, sophisticated design, and product quality is important.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Rotageek</b></p><p>A few years ago, Rotageek was a small side project; our CEO, an A&amp;E doctor, wanted to improve scheduling in his hospital department. Today, we’re a software company leading the way in reinventing how employees are scheduled. </p><p>We’re helping some of the largest UK organisations move from paper and excel based rotas to intelligent and interactive schedules. In doing so, we’re helping employees gain more ownership over their hours - improving their work-life balance - whilst making sure that businesses improve how they run their operations. We use intelligent technology to make sure the right staff are in the right place at the right time, whilst making the process of creating, communicating and modifying a rota as easy as possible.</p> <p><b>What we expect from our developers</b><br></p><ul><li>You have outstanding software development skills. You write clean, maintainable and technically sound code.</li><li>As part of the development team, you’re responsible for the scalability, security and performance of the platform. This responsibility underlines all of your work and it plays on repeat in your head whilst you code away.</li><li>You really want to build something new. You’re confident in suggesting new and brave ideas, technologies and ways of working.</li><li>You’re super eager, want to learn new technologies and get knee-deep in all areas of the code: front-end, back-end, mobile apps.</li><li>You’re happy to communicate clearly with both techy people as well as the wider business. Meaning you can explain things and not sound like you’re talking about quantum gravity.</li><li>You’re cool with documenting complex processes where needed. We try really hard to keep this to a minimum, but when it must be done it must be done and that’s that.</li></ul><p><b>As the ideal candidate, you have...</b></p><ul><li>A strong proficiency in JavaScript, including DOM manipulation and the JavaScript object model</li><li>A thorough understanding of React.js and its core principles</li><li>Experience with popular React.js workflows (such as Redux)</li><li>Experience with TypeScript</li><li>Familiarity with RESTful APIs</li><li>Familiarity with modern front-end build pipelines and tools</li><li>Experience with tools like Babel, Webpack, NPM, etc.</li><li>Ability to understand business requirements and translate them into technical requirements</li><li>Familiarity with code versioning tools in Git (Bitbucket)</li><li>Experience with mobile app development using React Native (advantageous but not essential)</li></ul><p><b>Apply!</b><br></p><p>If you think this sounds like something you'd enjoy and excel at, we would love to hear from you!&nbsp;</p><p>To apply, please send us your CV and a short paragraph explaining why you think you’d make a great React Developer to claire@rotageek.com.</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p> <p>(We’re not looking to work with recruiters for this job posting so please only contact us if you’re a candidate wishing to apply - thank you!)</p>"

Industrialisation has brought to our shelves mass-produced, mass-distributed products and mass-marketed brands.</p><p>Unfortunately for small wine producers, they can only craft by hand a small batch each time and thanks to the three-tier system, distribution happens at very low margins and sometimes even at a loss.</p><p><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_system_(alcohol_distribution)' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-tier_system_(alcohol_distribution)</a></p><p>Most wineries in the world (circa 80%) are small mum-and-dad businesses. Passionate about crafting a piece of art. Most are not business savvy. Most are not tech savvy. Most struggle with simply emailing those who love their product, and love their story. </p><p>Yet, to survive, they need more people who care about them, to talk about them. Direct sales is key to their survival.</p><p>This total disaster extends to every wine lover. The best wine stories ever encountered can hardly be brought home or shared with those we care most about.</p><p>That's wineries and microbreweries alike.</p><p>---</p><p>At Troly, we are slowly rebalancing the industry. By connecting wineries together, our project builds the volume and leverages our collective power to help each winery into their direct sale journey. Think of it as Fair Trade Wines!</p><p>We do not have fancy swanky offices (many work from home!) We have an intimate interest in ensuring each winery and microbrewery stands the test of time. We work very closely with wineries, on a first name basis, to educate them, and show them the tools they can leverage to make their journey easier. </p><p>It will be written in history that Troly.io changed the industry.

We are at a stage where our interest lies in finding founding team members. We will happily expose you to strategy, planning and the entire foundation of the business if and when required.</p><p>The right person is not afraid to shake things up or speak up when needed. They will stand their ground when they know they are right, and learn from it when they are wrong. </p><p>Technical skills are important, but making sure everyone in the team gets along is even more. We work in a distributed environment, so working alone, using technology for discussions and managing your own time are added challenges you will have to deal with.</p><p>Now, we also realise that these kind of people don’t just turn up out of the blue. So we are always on the lookout and are planning to grow based on people, not hire based on growth. In return, you must be committed, and anything measured in months will be considered insufficient.</p><p>Finally; if your only goal in life is to make a difference and genuinely help wineries, you really should get in touch.

    "content": "*SOLVING THE PROBLEM OF FOOD WASTE*<br /><br />OLIO is the world’s only neighbour-to-neighbour food sharing app, and our mission is to solve the problem of food waste in the home & local community. We do this by connecting anyone with spare food – which can be households or local businesses – with neighbours living nearby who would like it. Globally, over one third of all the food we produce gets thrown away, which is worth over $1 trillion. What few people realise however is that in the developed world, over half of all food waste takes place in the home, with the average UK family throwing away £800 of food each year - collectively adding up to £15bn. OLIO solves this with our award-winning mobile & web apps. Over the past 2 years OLIO has grown from a local initiative in North London to a global movement. <br /><br />We now have over 465,000 users who have together shared well over half a million portions of food – with food being successfully shared in 32 countries and counting. Underpinning this incredible growth has been our volunteer programme, with over 19,000 people reaching out to spread the word about OLIO in their local community and rescue unsold food.<br /><br />OLIO is now looking to grow our core team as we embark upon the next exciting phase in our journey.<br /><br />*JOIN OUR TEAM!*<br /><br />In order to accelerate OLIO to its next level in growth and impact, we are recruiting for a Data Analyst & Dashboard Developer, who will report into Viv Taylor, Product Manager.<br /><br />In this role you will be responsible for:<br /><br />* Data Analysis: Analysing key business questions in our burgeoning data via an SQL interface (both through<br />GUI and command line tools)<br />* Data Visualization: Development of a “data dashboard” for the company to help us interrogate our data<br />visually and in a user friendly manner<br />* Data Innovation: Liaison with our broader OLIO team to ensure that the right questions are being asked of<br />our growing datasets, in the right order.<br />* Data Exploration: Evaluation of the effects of specific initiatives/experiments at OLIO, generating and<br />presenting reports of their efficacy<br />* Setup of regular reports that provide insight into ongoing company/departmental performance.<br />* Assisting with online ad creative endeavours, their implementation and analysing their impact<br /><br />Once you have proven yourself you will have great freedom and autonomy, coupled with an enormous opportunity for personal development. All of our roles are remote working roles, however for London based team members<br />there is the ability to co-work as well. We live for our mission, but like to have fun along the way!<br /><br />*IS THIS YOU?*<br /><br />Our ideal candidate will first and foremost be as passionate about our mission as we are! In addition to this, you will have the following experience and skills:<br /><br />* Significant prior experience with SQL and RDBMS.<br />* Experience with Web Development and Visualization Tools, preferably with experience of relevant<br />JavaScript libraries (such as D3, jQuery, Bootstrap) and knowledge web models (e.g. LAMP)<br />* Experience of image processing software (e.g. Photoshop/GIMP)<br />* Excitement about Productivity Tools and Data Science.<br />* Curiosity about and enthusiasm for systems and processes<br />* Scrappy and resourceful when facing challenges of all types<br />* An eye for detail<br /><br />*Bonus points:*<br /><br />* You have experience working for a high-growth startup<br />And all OLIO team members share these attributes:<br />* A self-starter with a ‘can-do’ attitude<br />* Resourceful and creative<br />* Thorough, but able to move quickly and decisively<br />* A ruthless ability to prioritise<br />* Excellent communication skills<br />* Fun to work with :)"

There’s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products you’ve already bought. It’s irritating for the end user and counterproductive for the company attempting to sell their products or services. Using our tooling marketers can refine their targeting such that the ads are only shown to people who have shown genuine interest.<br /><br />WORKING AT DRIFTROCK<br /><br />Driftrock’s tooling provides our users with a way to receive, transform, track and optimise leads from social channels. Currently these tools look and feel very separate so we’re in the process of bringing them together, with the view to having Driftrock be more of a platform than a set of tools. Other problems we’re solving, and are looking to solve in the near future, include:<br />. How to securely and safely handle personally identifying information;<br />. How to enrich incoming data with information that will help our users decide on the best next steps for their leads;<br />. What reports to provide to our users such that they can see if their efforts are resulting in quality leads and what they can do to improve.<br /><br />The technology is a mixture of Ruby, Elixir and React applications hosted on Kubernetes and Google Cloud. We make use of Redis and Postgres for data storage and RabbitMQ for event processing.<br /><br />You will be expected to:<br />. Build RESTful APIs, event-based systems and front-end applications;<br />. Work with well-known public APIs like Facebook and LinkedIn;<br />. Design and improve user experience;<br />. Support production systems;<br />. Manage cloud infrastructure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE TEAM<br /><br />We’re a small team of 15 people at Driftrock but we’re growing. Our product development team is 7 people with 6 developers and 1 CTO, this means that anyone we bring in can have a huge impact on the culture and practices of the team. <br /><br />We believe in continuous improvement and we are constantly refining and improving how we work and communicate. One of the ways we do this is by performing fortnightly retrospectives, which are often run by different team members. <br /><br />Currently we make use of daily standups and weekly prioritisation meetings to ensure we're pulling in the same direction and maintaining our focus of delivering value to our end users early and often.<br /><br />ABOUT YOU<br /><br />. You should be keen to learn and improve technical, product and personal skills;<br />. You want to be involved in crafting products whilst building on the culture and process of the product team;<br />. You are happy working in a small team, collaborating closely with other engineers as well as our product and sales teams;<br />. You can provide new and diverse viewpoints for our technical and product discussions;<br />. You are interested in agile practices such as continuous delivery, TDD, pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives;<br />. You are keen to ensure there is a high standard of quality and security in the software we produce as a team;<br />. You have had some exposure to Ruby, Elixir or Javascript (we do not expect you to have experience in all of those languages); <br />. You have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br /><br />The interview process has some flexibility but is primarily made up of the following stages:<br /><br />. An initial phone conversation with an engineer;<br />. A take home technical test/coding challenge;<br />. Followed by an on-site pairing interview, where we'll build on your code challenge solution. We then do an informal problem solving task and we finish up with an informal chat with the rest of the team;<br /><br />We try our hardest to reduce the amount of stress involved in the process, we’re not trying to catch you out with trick questions and if at any point (even on the take home test) you have any questions for us we encourage you to ask them.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />. You will work with passionate and smart people, in an environment where we firmly believe in sharing knowledge;<br />. You will be an integral part of a growing and innovative tech startup;<br />. You can be enrolled to the Company’s pension scheme;<br />. The company atmosphere is social and friendly; <br />. You will be part of fun monthly team events.<br /><br /><br />We will not be considering any recruitment agencies for this role.<br /><br />&quot;By applying for this job you hereby give us permission to store your data on our secure applicant tracking system and to contact you with regards to Driftrock Ltd and our job opportunities. We will store your data for a year before deleting all individually identifiable information. If you wish data to be deleted sooner, respond to this email requesting the deletion of your data&quot;."

You actively assist and mentor your peers in their own learning, know when to ask for help yourself, and the two highlights of your sprint cycle are the planning and retrospective sessions, where you both give and take across story definition, personal recognition and constructive suggestions for improvements.<br><br>Your skills<br><br><br>* Javascript Expert: you know your promises from your closures and can tell the difference between your observables, prototypes and modules.<br><br><br><br><br><br>* ReactJS: if you haven’t yet, then you know you want to; and can instead demonstrate your expertise across Angular, Ember, Dojo or Vue.<br><br><br><br><br><br>* React Native: you may have only dabbled, or you may have apps already on the stores, complete with shelling out to native components and SDKs like Geolocation or NFC. Alternatively, if you’ve got some Android Java, SWIFT or ObjectiveC under your belt, then it all counts.<br><br>* AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Step Functions… or NodeJS: Let’s be realistic… not every developer has worked for forward-thinking companies that know serverless is the future, so if you haven’t yet had a chance to ditch the [virtual] tin, prove to us instead that you are a NodeJS guru and can learn the modern AWS FaaS methodologies as you go.<br><br>* Redux? Webpack? Gulp? Browserify? Flux? Relay? Flow? ImmutableJS?: If you have the skills and can prove the advantage of your preferred libraries to your peers, then consensus will mean go for it (license agreement permitting).<br><br>* HTML/CSS/SASS/LESS/REST/JSON: Duh!<br><br>* TDD/BDD: we shouldn’t even have to mention it. You’ve been on Github. You know that no self respecting NPM ships without its tests. You practice what you preach and provide unto others what which you expect to consume yourself… and it’s not an afterthought.<br><br>* Terraform: if you’ve got it, we’ll take it.<br><br>* Security ingrained: You know your CAPTCHAs from your SQL injection from your brute force attacks, how to specify and develop to mitigate them, and under the covers you know your IAM from your KMS from your Secrets Manager and will layer security throughout your application stack. ...PII - encrypt it!<br><br>* English Communication Skills: you can debate your technical solutions with developers and business people alike. You won’t be expected to write War &amp; Peace, but you will be expected to keep the development wiki comprehensible<br><br><br><p>See more jobs at <span>Coachhire.com</span></p></div></div>"

Wouldn’t it make better sense, he thought, to use their smartphones to study? When he didn’t find an effective mobile-learning solution, he decided to create it. HLT was born. Since its start in 2012, HLT has attracted millions of learners and become the market-leading platform for mLearning applications.<br><br>HLT’s rapid growth is directly attributable to their emphasis on attracting top talent and building a culture that is nationally renowned. &nbsp;This includes being on Entrepreneur Magazine’s coveted “Top Company Cultures” list.<br><br>What You Will Be Doing<br><br>You will be part of the development team building our content management system(CMS) that powers our mobile and web applications. &nbsp;You will get to come to work everyday knowing you are helping educate millions of people all around the world. <br><br>Who We Are Looking For<br><br>We are looking to work with the best. Our peer. Someone who learns from us as much as we learn from them. We are looking for someone bright with a proven track record in developing software for high quality, scalable applications. Someone we'll be proud to say is part of our family and who will play a large role in pushing HLT forward.<br><br>We’re not going to list 100 technologies you need to know to join our team.

We just need you to be online and available via Slack during regular business hours. We're a team and we work as a team, so even if your preferred hours are the wee hours of morning, that doesn't work for us because we need a team player, not a lone wolf.<br><br>What We Pay<br><br>This is a full time position and everyone who works for us gets paid pretty darn well. In addition to medical, dental and vision insurance, we also offer 8 holidays + 3 floating paid holidays. We have always maintained a &quot;take what you need but don't screw it up for others&quot; stance on vacation and PTO.<br><br>How To Apply<br><br>So if you are interested in working for a great company alongside a bunch of really talented developers, building cool software with the best tools, all from the comfort of your own home then please send us:<br><br><br>* Your github username<br><br>* A short description of something really cool you've worked on - code or tech-related, and preferably as your own project rather than something as part of an existing job. Perhaps a web app, node package or a mobile app. Or a fun game you built. Something!<br><br><br><br><br>That it's. You can send us your resume too, but those things read like fiction anyway, so we're more interested in seeing the work you've done and projects that you've contributed to.<br><br>Life at HLT<br><br>Benefits<br><br><br>* Remote working<br><br>* Flexible hours<br><br>* Large amounts of autonomy<br><br>* Great pay, insurance, benefits<br><br><br><br><br>So Why HLT?<br><br>If you’re interested in<br><br><br>* Coming up with solutions, not just completing tasks<br><br>* Being part of a passionate team determined to improve education<br><br>* A fast paced and fun work environment<br><br>* A career with a higher purpose<br><br><br><br><br>Then we we would love to talk to you!<p>See more jobs at <span>Higher Learning Technologies</span></p></div></div>"

    "content": "Location: Old Street, London N1<br /><br />Start Date: ASAP<br /><br />Salary: depending on experience and skill level<br /><br />WHO ARE DRIFTROCK?<br /><br />Driftrock was started with the aim of making advertising through social channels better. There’s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products you’ve already bought. It’s irritating for the end user and counterproductive for the company attempting to sell their products or services. Using our tooling marketers can refine their targeting such that the ads are only shown to people who have shown genuine interest.<br /><br />WORKING AT DRIFTROCK<br /><br />Driftrock’s tooling provides our users with a way to receive, transform, track and optimise leads from social channels. Currently these tools look and feel very separate so we’re in the process of bringing them together, with the view to having Driftrock be more of a platform than a set of tools. Other problems we’re solving, and are looking to solve in the near future, include:<br /><br />* How to securely and safely handle personally identifying information; <br />* How to enrich incoming data with information that will help our users decide on the best next steps for their leads; <br />* What reports to provide to our users such that they can see if their efforts are resulting in quality leads and what they can do to improve.<br /><br />The technology is a mixture of Ruby, Elixir and React applications hosted on Kubernetes and Google Cloud. We make use of Redis and Postgres for data storage and RabbitMQ for event processing.<br /><br />You will be expected to:<br /><br />* Build RESTful APIs, event-based systems and front-end applications; <br />* Work with well-known public APIs like Facebook and LinkedIn; <br />* Design and improve user experience; <br />* Support production systems; <br />* Manage cloud infrastructure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE TEAM<br /><br />We’re a small team of 15 people at Driftrock but we’re growing. Our product development team is 7 people with 6 developers and 1 CTO, this means that anyone we bring in can have a huge impact on the culture and practices of the team.<br /><br />We believe in continuous improvement and we are constantly refining and improving how we work and communicate. One of the ways we do this is by performing fortnightly retrospectives, which are often run by different team members.<br /><br />Currently we make use of daily standups and weekly prioritisation meetings to ensure we're pulling in the same direction and maintaining our focus of delivering value to our end users early and often.<br /><br />ABOUT YOU<br /><br />* You should be keen to learn and improve technical, product and personal skills; <br />* You want to be involved in crafting products whilst building on the culture and process of the product team; <br />* You are happy working in a small team, collaborating closely with other engineers as well as our product and sales teams; <br />* You can provide new and diverse viewpoints for our technical and product discussions; <br />* You are interested in agile practices such as continuous delivery, TDD, pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives; <br />* You are keen to ensure there is a high standard of quality and security in the software we produce as a team; <br />* You are interested in mentoring and coach other team members; <br />* You have had some exposure to Ruby, Elixir or Javascript (we do not expect you to have experience in all of those languages); <br />* You have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br /><br />The interview process has some flexibility but is primarily made up of the following stages:<br /><br />* An initial phone conversation with an engineer; <br />* A take home technical test/coding challenge; <br />* Followed by an on-site pairing interview, where we'll build on your code challenge solution. We then do an informal problem solving task and we finish up with an informal chat with the rest of the team. <br /><br />We try our hardest to reduce the amount of stress involved in the process, we’re not trying to catch you out with trick questions and if at any point (even on the take home test) you have any questions for us we encourage you to ask them.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />* You will work with passionate and smart people, in an environment where we firmly believe in sharing knowledge; <br />* You will be an integral part of a growing and innovative tech startup; <br />* You can be enrolled to the Company’s pension scheme; <br />* The company atmosphere is social and friendly; <br />* You will be part of fun monthly team events.<br /><br />We will not be considering any recruitment agencies for this role.<br /><br />&quot;By applying for this job you hereby give us permission to store your data on our secure applicant tracking system and to contact you with regards to Driftrock Ltd and our job opportunities. We will store your data for a year before deleting all individually identifiable information. If you wish data to be deleted sooner, respond to this email requesting the deletion of your data&quot;."

    "content": "h1. For developers, insurtech is the playground you never knew you wanted. <br /><br />We’re taking on big, never-before-solved problems with new technologies - all while fully funded and facing massive growth in a stable, wealthy industry.<br /><br />When you join us, we’ll kit you out with a full spec Macbook Pro, likely set you up to pair with another developer and get you into the codebase as quickly as possible. As a startup, we need you to be curious, tenacious and driven, constantly looking for new and better ways to build our complex product using new and better processes, tools, frameworks, whatever it takes.<br /><br />In our small team there is enormous scope to have your say, to influence how we work, what we work on and, ultimately, what Wrisk will become for our future millions of international users. And we'll offer you some ownership in the business, so you'll share in every success ahead of us.<br /><br />h2. What you’ll do<br /><br />As a full stack developer you will take features from start to finish, collaborating with others as you go. You will be often required to turn your hand to something new, possibly something you have not done before; you might pair with a specialist in areas where we have in-house expertise or following industry best practices from your own research. <br /><br />You'll be working very closely with CTO Alex to build out a micro-services architected platform - the engine that powers the Wrisk app. This platform integrates with many clients from our own app to external data sources and third party solution providers, so there's a lot to do. <br /><br />Applications are written Kotlin, so demonstrable experience creating production quality JVM based applications is pretty much essential. If you've worked on delivering a mobile friendly RESTful API that would be a bonus, and if that has led you to thinking of tools like Dropwizard and Swagger, all the better. <br /><br />You should have some demonstrable experience using a modern JavaScript technology to build user facing applications. We currently use React/Redux for some of our internal web applications and are migrating our Swift mobile application to React Native so any experience with RN is a huge plus.<br /><br />Finally, you’ll be deploying the apps you’ve written to our environment in AWS. You should be familiar with Infrastructure As Code and containerisation using technologies such as Terraform and Docker.<br /><br />h2. How you’ll work<br /><br />While what you work on is well-structured and organised, how you work is up to you. The office is relaxed, with flexible working available to everyone. You’ll meet with your whole team every morning (remotely by video if you’re away from the office) followed by a quick tech huddle, but other than that your time is your own. If you want to take 10 minutes to clear your head with meditation, a trip to a local hipster coffee shop or a game of table tennis - go for it. Nobody’s clock-watching. We just care that the work gets done, to a high standard, on time.<br /><br />We believe in, and practice, the Lean ideas of build/measure/learn, and will be very happy to show you the kanban storyboard you will be building from. You will participate in, and often lead, our retrospectives, as well as presenting at the bi-weekly showcases, to the wider team, which are essential for ensuring we are all on the same page.<br /><br />We typically start with a workshop to define what we need to achieve, leading to wireframes and perhaps some high level tasks. We refine and test until we believe we have the core of what we want and then we build the smallest amount we can to validate this - sometimes in code, sometimes in prototype. We do regular user testing, rapid prototyping and code spikes to ensure we only build the most-right thing we can right now.<br /><br />h2. What you’ll get<br /><br />Our future actually looks even rosier from inside the company, where we can see what’s on the roadmap and who’s expressed an interest in us. We already have investment and support from some major partners. We’re going places - and we want you with us. You'll help build the path that gets us there, with some equity of your own so you’re properly rewarded when we arrive.<br /><br />We also offer a competitive salary, 30 days holiday allowance (with public holidays on top) and flexible working conditions. We're currently based in Techspace Shoreditch, a short walk from Old Street. Our offices are modern and bright, with the startup-essential posh coffee and ping pong table, as well as indoor bicycle parking and shower."

    "content": "At PassFort, we share a powerful vision to enable businesses & individuals to establish trust online. We’re connecting the human concept of trust with the transformative technology of the internet.<br /><br />We currently do this by giving businesses the tools they need to automate and digitalise the onboarding, verification and management of their customer relationships - that means customers can be onboarded in real-time, from the comfort of their own home. <br /><br />Nowhere are these tools more necessary than in regulated markets - where compliance with regulations, such as anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC), have for too long been a sinkhole for product, engineering & compliance resource and customer goodwill.<br /><br />And this is just the beginning - our long term aim is to bring together all aspects of your identity into a digital passport that can be used securely and interchangeably online. We're transforming how trust is established online, in the same way that Salesforce transformed sales, Stripe transformed payments and AWS transformed DevOps.<br /><br />What you’ll be doing<br /><br />We’re looking for talented full stack engineers ready to make an impact. <br /><br />You’ll work with a great modern stack - including ES6 and React on the front-end, and Python and Rust on the back-end. We have a microservice based architecture built on top of Kubernetes and Google’s Cloud Platform. <br />We empower our team to have ownership across the entire product. You’ll think about everything from architecture, security and performance, all the way through to feature UX. You’ll be developing  entire features, including technical design, implementation and release. <br /><br />You’ll be comfortable working across the code base, and learning new technologies as the business requires - you might prefer a back or front end focus, but you’ll be open to a working knowledge of both.<br /><br />We’ll trust (and depend!) on you to speak up, voice your opinion, and respectfully challenge. You’ll have the chance to bring new ideas, and become an integral part of the process to continuously improve our product, along with our working practices. We think everyone can teach us something - and offer mentorship to more junior members. <br /><br />What we’re looking for<br /><br />We like to keep it simple<br />* Foremost, we’ll be looking for someone who fits well with our company culture and values - Trust, Empowerment and Growth<br />* You’ll need a deep knowledge of either Python, Rust, or Javascript (we use React), and at least a desire to learn the others.<br />* Specialised experience in any of the following areas would be a plus - DevOps (Kubernetes), Security, UX and design<br /><br />The Perks<br /><br />* Equity! We want you to succeed as we do<br />* Great location - we’re central to three stations, and sandwiched between Brick Lane and Spitalfields market<br />* An annual learning & development budget to spend on professional or personal development, we’re invested in both<br />* Birthday off - relax and put your feet up<br />* Dental cover<br />* Access to Perkbox - discounts to services and products (and honestly it’s fantastic)<br />* Equally Enhanced Maternity/Paternity/Shared Leave pay <br />* Generous holiday entitlement<br />* Pension contributions - investing in your future is important<br />* Pick your own equipment and kit<br />* Biscuits… we’re a bit obsessed. We have a weekly ‘guest’ biscuit to broaden your biscuit horizons.<br /><br />Check out our careers site to get more insight into our team, and company culture and values! <br />https://jobs.passfort.com/jobs/105219-fullstack-developer<br />"
