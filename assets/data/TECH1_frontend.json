We love to contribute to the progress of agriculture. Our main cause is to support the farmer because in the end, it's all about mutual care and cooperation. Agriculture is our home and our origin and we speak from our own experience and know about the specific needs, which makes us the perfect partner for the agricultural trading of the next century. We want to push agriculture forward using state of the art technologies and we constantly stay in motion by taking one step at a time, being excited about everything that comes along. Working with us means to make a difference and to help us developing a meaningful product that in the end has an impact on the future of sustainable agriculture and thus the food you eat everyday.</p><p><strong><em><strong>What you should bring</strong></em></strong></p><ul><li>Great communication skills, ability to work in an agile team and workflow experience (git-flow, scrum, etc.)</li><li>4+ years proven JS work experience in a professional or institutional environment (including usage of node/npm/yarn)</li><li>Demonstrable experiences with Vue.js (or at least one out of the following: Backbone/Ember/Angular/React)</li><li>Demonstrated facility in a HTML/CSS/SASS/LESS environment</li><li>General understanding of core computer programming, distributed systems, logic &amp; cloud infrastructure as well as concepts like REST or GraphQL</li><li>Open-mindedness and an attitude that encourages nurturing your skills, learning new ones while at the same time passing on knowledge in areas you excel</li><li>Passion for writing quality, high-performance and maintainable code following best practices by heart</li><li>Farming experience (just joking but having played Farming Simulator does count)</li></ul><p><strong><strong>What to expect</strong></strong></p><p>As a Lead Front End Engineer at Agrando you will lead our team of frontend engineers in the creation of our main SPA frontend for the stakeholders on our trading platform (farmers, retailers, producers) as well as other products. You will make technologies or frameworks like Jest or TailwindCSS work for you. Most importantly, you will be responsible for our Front End architecture which is based on the latest JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Vuex, Axios as well as REST APIs and GraphQL. You will improve the UX and UI together with our Designers and guide them in their implementation efforts to align the product to their design philosophies. On the other hand, you will directly influence decisions supporting our DevOps, Analytics, Design and Product Department while keeping yourself in sync with the Sales &amp; Marketing team.</p><p>Since future logic is also driven by our data intensive infrastructure it is a plus if you want to get in touch with other parts of our product like our BI &amp; Big Data Pipeline (GCP) and Machine Learning strategies. We constantly explore latest technologies to find the best solutions to our next-gen problems - thus hacking around and bringing in your own ideas is something we highly encourage.</p><p><strong><em><strong>Perks</strong></em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Flexible:</strong> We have a non-clock-watching culture and while the job is at our Munich Office we are very flexible when you want to work from home on occasion.</li><li><strong>Events Around the Globe:</strong> Not only do we host internal Team Events, but since we are an aspiring AgTech Startup you can join us on various Trips, Conventions, Conferences (We are regular visitors at Vue.js Amsterdam and it always has been a total blast), Tech Fairs, Trade Shows and other Events around the World, related to our business or the technologies involved.</li><li><strong>Make a Difference:</strong> In the end we try to save our farmers money by purchasing agricultural inputs more cost-efficiently, which in turn can save farms with less revenues than production costs from bankruptcy (e.g. coming from low milk prices), while at the same time enabling private suppliers to compete and advance in the digitized agricultural trade of the future.</li><li><strong>Advanced Training:</strong> At Agrando we believe in nurturing our skills through proper knowledge management and personal development. We encourage our employees to learn, teach and improve also through advanced trainings, workshops, (hosted) meetups or other external activities and provide them with the best resources (Books, Coachings &amp; Trainings, Udemy for Business, Nanodegrees from Udacity) for free.</li><li><strong>Additional Benefits:</strong> Weapons of choice (MBP etc.), Qualitrain (subsidized sports), Coffee &amp; Beer, Organic Fruits &amp; YumYum Soups, Switch &amp; XBOX360 Gaming</li></ul><p></p><p>If you are more motivated than others and you want to develop yourself further in an aspiring workplace environment, we are looking forward to receiving your application.

This is a remote, full-time position.</p><p>CLIENT COMPANY DESCRIPTION:<br>The client company is a membership organisation which provides country sports insurance and other benefits to members in the UK and Ireland. The company and its first club were established in 2008 and sister club was launched in 2017. They are looking to streamline the purchase process and improve overall user experience to encourage new members and maintain existing members. They also want to improve their search rankings by ensuring the new site is optimised to help potential customers find them, and relevant information about their products, quickly and easily.<br><br>DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:<br>You will be tasked with developing two new websites from scratch (and potentially maintain them in the future)<br><br>Both websites are for clubs which require a membership database, members area with login, e-commerce and an admin control panel to manage memberships / purchases etc. There are various referral forms and a member’s benefits page which needs to have an interface for Trade Associates to upload details of special offers to members - this needs an approval system. There are lots more unique elements which require additional features for specific types of memberships/sales and, although functionality is broadly similar across the two sites, the second club also requires some extra functionality not required in the first.<br><br>Features they do not currently have and would like to introduce include optional recurring / automated renewal and payments, means to purchase multiple memberships in a single transaction, claims forms and claims management in the admin panel, ability to attach uploaded files to a member's record, ability to create custom reports and many more minor tweaks.<br><br>The current websites have been built (and built upon) by their in-house web developer. As the company has grown, requirements and systems have changed and the existing database and code is no longer fit for their purpose. They require a full structural review of the database and rebuilding from the ground up to ensure everything is fully cohesive. Existing membership data will need to be migrated into the new database and systems.<br><br>Once the new sites are finished and launched the client will require ongoing maintenance and updates.<br><br>RELATIONSHIPS - WHO YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH:<br>You will be reporting to the Managing Director and consulting with existing in house developer (and potentially another freelance developer) as needed. The client is in the Europe/London (+00:00) GMT time zone.<br><br>REQUIRED SKILLS:<br>- Strong English Communication<br>- PHP (Laravel or Symfony experience strongly preferred)<br>- JavaScript<br>- HTML<br>- CSS<br>- MySQL<br>- Server Configuration and Management in AWS<br>- Git<br><br>DESIRED (NICE-TO-HAVE) SKILLS:<br>- Experience with a modern JavaScript framework like React, Angular or Vue)<br>- Payment Gateway Integration experience<br><br>START DATE:<br>March 16, 2020<br><br>EXPECTED CONTRACT DURATION:<br>About 6 months but this is flexible. Ongoing maintenance thereafter.<br><br>NOTES:<br>The client is open to someone who can start part-time, but with a transition to full-time.</p><p>HOURLY RATE:</p><p>The pay rate for this role is from $30 to $50 USD per hour, depending on experience and capability.</p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

The product needs a low floor and a high ceiling — it should be simple enough for anyone to get started with, but powerful enough for really complex use-cases. Performance is paramount on both the frontend and backend.</p><p>---</p><p>We have a nice office in London (UK) but are also open to remote hires. If this sounds interesting then I'd love to chat! taimur (at) causal.app</p>",

One of the Tech Nation &ldquo;Future Fifty&rdquo; alumni and one of the Sunday Times Top 100 Small Companies to Work For 2020, we&rsquo;re now the fastest growing online flower company in Europe.</p><br /><p>Our business has, so far, been in the fortunate position to be able to continue trading and growing during this time of economic uncertainty, with the Government actively encouraging online retail, and customer demand for flowers for their loved ones is strong due to social distancing measures in place.</p><br /><p>This is a great opportunity for a Software Engineering Manager with people management experience to lead two cross functional engineering squads. You will report to Steve, our VP Engineering who is extremely passionate about people development and scaling teams. You&rsquo;ll get to shape both people and platforms to support our ambitious growth plans and take part in the next phase of our success.</p><br /><p>In Technology we're split into three squads with a fourth on the way. You'll start by leading the Growth squad, which focuses on driving profitable customer acquisition across all of our markets.&nbsp; This means helping to inspire our customers to understand, find, compare and select their perfect gift as well as working on improvements to our core checkout flow - delightfully expressing our brand to new customers and making it easy to order flowers.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll then play a leading part in the setup and day to day running of our new Expansion squad, with a mission to accelerate growth outside our UK core business. You&rsquo;ll work closely with our VP of Business Development as the squad works on solutions that build our international markets, develop new distribution channels and support the development of new products and services.</p><br /><p><strong>About you</strong></p><br /><p>Building diverse, happy, high performing squads will be a key part of what you do.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We believe strongly in giving our squads autonomy, while using cross team communities of practice and company wide OKRs to ensure alignment. You&rsquo;ll need to be comfortable working at pace, while fostering a mindset of continuous improvement within the squad, evolving and extending the agile, iterative approach to meet the squad&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll play a leading part in delivering the product and technology roadmap, and ensuring that customer needs are at the forefront of the squad members minds. We favour a collaborative, data-driven and experimental approach to solving complex problems, and expect our Engineering Managers to foster this mindset in their squads. You&rsquo;ll ensure that there is a focus on scrum mastery within your squad, either by playing the role yourself or empowering a squad member to assist you.</p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll work closely with other Engineering Managers, VP Engineering and community of practice leads to shape the technology roadmap and strategy going forwards, ensuring that we are improving the whole team and optimising the approach for more than just your squad.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Ideally your background will be in frontend development and this will enable you to help your squad interpret requirements into something they can deliver as you work with them to find the right technical approach. Working with our VP Engineering and Technology Leadership team, you&rsquo;ll help to solve our top priority problems for the quarter from a technology and people perspective.</p><br /><p>As an experienced people manager you&rsquo;ll take responsibility for performance management, career progression, pastoral care and everything else that means that you have a happy and motivated squad. The team environment that you create will promote both autonomy and accountability. You&rsquo;ll be a great coach and servant leader, able to motivate and guide the squad through the good times and the bad, learning and improving as you go.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We care about creating a diverse and inclusive team - it's what helps us generate the best ideas and grow faster. We want to make giving and receiving gifts a joy for everyone, and to do this we need people from all backgrounds, with different perspectives and ideas. We welcome anyone to apply, with the knowledge that you&rsquo;ll have the freedom to give your opinion, do your best work and be part of a genuinely inclusive, friendly and caring team.</p><br /><p><strong>Our tech</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll also get to work with some great technology. Our stack consists of iOS and Android apps, an Angular 7 website and backend platform in Ruby on Rails. We encourage our developers to be full stack and our squads to own their code from their local machine into usage in production. We&rsquo;re focusing heavily on increasing our usage of machine learning and automation of our business processes so we can continue to scale at pace.

Any full stack engineer that has skills in docker / aws / devops could really make a difference in that area as well.\\n\\nFront-end specialist candidates will have:\\n\\n\\n* AngularJS / Typescript\\n\\n* Angular (front-end specialist only)\\n\\n* Excellent HTML / CSS / LESS or SASS / Bootstrap\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFront-end specialist desirable skills:\\n\\n\\n* .NET / C#\\n\\n* SQL Server T-SQL\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFull-stack candidates will have:\\n\\n\\n* AngularJS / Typescript\\n\\n* HTML / CSS / LESS or SASS / Bootstrap\\n\\n* Very good T-SQL (including performance, execution plan analysis etc)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFull-stack desirable skills:\\n\\n\\n* Angular\\n\\n* .NET Core\\n\\n* Kafka\\n\\n* Redis\\n\\n* AWS / Docker / Microservices\\n\\n\\n  </div> </div>",

Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.\\n\\nWe are a socially conscious, distributed team. We give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living where you’re most comfortable and working in areas where you can help foster and grow the community that you are a part of.\\n\\nWe believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth. As one of our first front-end developers, your decisions will have an outsized influence on the future of our product.&nbsp; You’ll take input from product, design, and customers and then you’ll collaborate with other experienced, passionate engineering team to build the frameworks and features that will support our customers now, and in the future.\\n\\nSigns of a great candidate\\n\\n\\n* Collaborative.&nbsp;You know that your colleagues’ perspectives will make our customers successful. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together. You propose ways for us to be more engaged and successful with our customers.\\n\\n* Customer focused. Our customers are at the forefront of your day.&nbsp; You prioritize our customers’ voice to ensure their needs are met.&nbsp;\\n\\n* Ambitious, curious, and resourceful.&nbsp;You are innately curious, and you aren’t afraid to work hard. You are self driven, you take direction well but are able to be creative to find results on your own when asked. You are driven to succeed because your hard work and results make you proud.\\n\\n* Disciplined and reliable.&nbsp; We are a distributed company and you enjoy the benefits of working distributed while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.\\n\\n* Appreciative of honest feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.\\n\\n* Work smarter and harder.&nbsp;You often identify a problem, create a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own.&nbsp; You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCrisp's Frontend Tech Stack&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* Statically typed, modern languages.&nbsp;We use TypeScript and React for the UI, and GraphQL with Apollo to communicate with our backend.&nbsp; Knowledge of these specific technologies is not a requirement. If you’re willing to learn, we’re willing to help you along the way.\\n\\n* Continuous deployment.&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.\\n\\n* Micro-services.&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.\\n\\n* Start-up mode.&nbsp; The team is still small, and the product is fresh.&nbsp; You’ll be able to exert a large amount of influence, and contribute to decisions that will determine the future of the product and the team.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific background, experience or geographical location. Instead we’re looking for individuals that are capable, reliable, and hoping to grow along with us.

This is a remote, full-time position.\\n\\nCLIENT COMPANY DESCRIPTION:\\nThe client operates a popular software for cannabis industry compliance. Is the fastest-growing Seed to Sale Cannabis tracking platform in the US. They help cannabis business owners by providing seamless integration with their California State reporting system to monitor inventory, prevent diversion, and collect taxes. About 1,000 cannabis operators currently use the product.\\n\\nDUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES:\\nThe client needs to modernize and rebuild the frontend of a legacy AngularJS app in React/Redux in a very rapid/iterative fashion. The UX will not change a lot, but new, modern frontend technologies will be used. There are existing REST APIs (powered by ASP.Net v4) which can power much of functionality, and there will be dedicated backend developers available to improve APIs as necessary to ensure smooth/clear contracts between frontend and backend. The client is also considering wrapping the backend REST APIs in GraphQL so that the frontend code can use GraphQL queries as opposed to REST queries.\\n\\nYour responsibility will be modernizing the frontend of the Application using React and Redux.\\n\\nThe client would really like to build the new frontend using TypeScript, but if they can't find developers quickly enough who know TypeScript, they may be open to using regular JavaScript.\\n\\nThey are currently using the Semantic UI frontend framework, but they are concerned with the long-term maintenance of that framework and are open to moving to Bootstrap or Material UI.\\n\\nThe entire React application will be deployed to Firebase as a static application (no server-side rendering needed).\\n\\nThe client is using Jira for project management and Git (Bitbucket) for source control.\\n\\nRELATIONSHIPS - WHO YOU'LL BE WORKING WITH:\\nYou'll be reporting to a Lead Engineer and working with two backend engineers, a designer, and a product owner. There is an existing daily meeting at 9:00 am America/Los Angeles (-07:00) PDT.\\n\\nREQUIRED SKILLS:\\n- Excellent written and spoken English communication skills\\n- React\\n- Redux\\n- CSS\\n- Ability to move quickly to replicate an existing legacy project and work with the existing backend team\\n- Git\\n\\nDESIRED (NICE-TO-HAVE) SKILLS:\\n- Experience with GraphQL (Apollo)\\n- TypeScript (Strongly preferred)\\n- Cypress.io test framework (or experience with similar end-to-end testing framework)\\n- Jira\\n\\nSTART DATE:\\nAs soon as possible.\\n\\nEXPECTED CONTRACT DURATION:\\nThis project will last anywhere from 2-4 months.\\n\\nNOTES:\\nThe client plans on hiring two frontend developers, so if you do not have experience with all the tools, you still may be selected for the project if your skills are complementary with the second developer's.\\n\\n\\n\\nHOURLY RATE:\\n\\nThe pay rate for this role is from $60 - $140 USD per hour, depending on experience and capability.  </div> </div>",

The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry.

We expect everyone to understand&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;they are working on a particular activity or objective, being clear on how it will benefit the business and our customers.</li><li><strong>Be proactive and dependable:&nbsp;</strong>Everyone can solve problems and remove barriers to growth — both personally and for the company. We are quick to raise issues and ideas, and to recommend next steps.

We expect high attention-to-detail, whether it's in how we write an email, review our analytics, or design the site. We delight in getting the details right, even in internal documents. High attention to detail isn’t something you turn on and off — it’s an attitude.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Always look to improve:</strong>&nbsp;We survive and grow by constantly looking for opportunities to improve our solutions, our processes and ourselves. We own our mistakes, using them as an opportunity to learn what changes we should make to processes and tools. We expect our people to proactively look for opportunities to develop and improve our own performance.</li><li><strong>Enjoy the journey:&nbsp;</strong>We consider our health and families to be more important than work. We ensure no-one feels that they are frequently required to work excessive hours. We support each other in overcoming problems and achieving work and life goals. We’re positive and enthusiastic — helping everyone feel energized to take us to the next level. We don’t pin our happiness on the attainment of a particular end goal - we delight in every step along the way.</li></ol><p>We don’t just ‘say’ these are our values.

We’ve built:</p><ul><li><strong>A user-created library of templated docs</strong>, so you never have to start from scratch</li><li><strong>Workspaces&nbsp;</strong>that bring your team together in a single home for your work</li><li><strong>Powerful search</strong>&nbsp;that gets you to the right doc, every time</li><li><strong>Linked document versions</strong>, so you can merge or update multiple docs in one tap</li><li><strong>Approvals</strong>&nbsp;to keep your team aligned and on track through complex workflows</li></ul><p>We've seen professionals waste too much time managing information across disorganized documents instead of doing meaningful work. We believe this problem isn’t rooted in a lack of knowledge in the world, but in the deficiencies of tools we rely on to access, share, and improve how work gets done.</p><p>We’ve been moving fast since we founded Almanac in January 2019. Almanac is now used by over 4000 teams and sees over 50,000 visitors per month to its public Core of knowledge.

We are a team of multinational people with various domain of expertise ranging from business, to data science, to logistics, to software development, to finance… A nice blend of domain and technology expertise.</p><p><strong>CEL is putting together a full product team to create a ground breaking Simulation As A Service offer that will deeply impact the supply chain industry.</strong></p><p><em>Why is Supply Chain important?</em></p><p>Take a second and look around you - everything you see has came to you through a supply chain, starting from a natural resource into your home through hundreds of activities more or less coordinated so you have what you want when you want.</p><p>So Supply Chain is everything of the physical world. Without supply chains, there are no businesses, no jobs, no buildings, no economy, nothing.</p><p>So we think that it’s kind of important.</p><p>After 15 years of working with hundred of companies that make and distribute their products (from milk to shoes, from furniture to cement, from electronics to vegetables….) we have came to a simple conclusion: it is too complex for people to operate properly. Current IT system, organisation, processes actually don’t help much. All these networks of flows are inherently inefficient.</p><p>Why? Complexity. No human brain is capable to comprehend the actual dynamics of such complex systems. No IT tool, no ERP, no fancy solution is actually taking a holistic view of the problem, instead each of these focus on improving small pieces.</p><p>The result? massive wastes of resources, enormous amount of inventory, unnecessary impact on the environment… and ultimately rare are the cases when supply actually meets demand, creating massive systemic effect and rather low customer satisfaction. Pure waste.</p><p>So we decided to really do something about it.</p><p>We are currently developing a product that that combines technologies like Data Science, Simulation Modelling, Cloud computing - backed up with years of business experience - to help companies actually assess what their future could look like and figure out what alternatives exist.</p><p>To replace the common approach of guessing what could happen, we are aiming at answering “What if” questions in an easy, sexy and fast manner.</p><p>Imagine you could simulate various scenario of your own future, would your life decisions be better?

Our stack includes React, React Native, Electron, GCS, AWS, C#, and Java. We don't expect experience with all of these, but we do expect you to be able to learn quickly and pick up what you need to know. The majority of work will be in React.</p><p>You'll be working with a great distributed engineering team with a history of working with large-scale web applications.

But we're always looking for ways to improve. People rarely work more than 40 hrs/wk and we spend&nbsp;0% of our time fighting fires.</p><p>There's no babysitting. You're in charge of yourself. That means you work where and when you want.</p><p>Culture is really important to us. But building culture in a remote team can be difficult. We do a lot of things to try to remedy that. Chief among them are our annual retreats. Last year our retreat was in Lisbon, Portugal. We had a hackathon, broke out of escape rooms, and ate lots of good food.</p><p>There's always something challenging to work and great people to spend your days with building things at Hubstaff.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible schedule</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote / Work from home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Job security / Long term</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 72 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>            </div>        <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>            Apply        </a>                            </div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives.

We are a team of multinational people with various domain of expertise ranging from business, to data science, to logistics, to software development, to finance… A nice blend of domain and technology expertise.</p><p><strong>CEL is putting together a full product team to create a ground breaking Simulation As A Service offer that will deeply impact the supply chain industry.</strong></p><p><em>Why is Supply Chain important?</em></p><p>Take a second and look around you - everything you see has came to you through a supply chain, starting from a natural resource into your home through hundreds of activities more or less coordinated so you have what you want when you want.</p><p>So Supply Chain is everything of the physical world. Without supply chains, there are no businesses, no jobs, no buildings, no economy, nothing.</p><p>So we think that it’s kind of important.</p><p>After 15 years of working with hundred of companies that make and distribute their products (from milk to shoes, from furniture to cement, from electronics to vegetables….) we have came to a simple conclusion: it is too complex for people to operate properly. Current IT system, organisation, processes actually don’t help much. All these networks of flows are inherently inefficient.</p><p>Why? Complexity. No human brain is capable to comprehend the actual dynamics of such complex systems. No IT tool, no ERP, no fancy solution is actually taking a holistic view of the problem, instead each of these focus on improving small pieces.</p><p>The result? massive wastes of resources, enormous amount of inventory, unnecessary impact on the environment… and ultimately rare are the cases when supply actually meets demand, creating massive systemic effect and rather low customer satisfaction. Pure waste.</p><p>So we decided to really do something about it.</p><p>We are currently developing a product that that combines technologies like Data Science, Simulation Modelling, Cloud computing - backed up with years of business experience - to help companies actually assess what their future could look like and figure out what alternatives exist.</p><p>To replace the common approach of guessing what could happen, we are aiming at answering “What if” questions in an easy, sexy and fast manner.</p><p>Imagine you could simulate various scenario of your own future, would your life decisions be better? Most likely!</p><p>If the challenge is of interest to you, if you are keen to understand how product-driven businesses actually works, if you are willing to make full use of your systemic thinking and bridge the gap between the physical and virtual world, and if you have the competencies we are after, then we may pretty much want to work together to change the world!</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shares and revenu shares</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full remote possible</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team trips to Vietnam (head office)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly team retreat</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Cross field product with a huge disruption potential</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
