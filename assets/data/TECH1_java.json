By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.</p><p>We are a remote-first company which means we give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living and working wherever you are most comfortable. We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth.</p><p>As a member of the first few engineering teams at Crisp you have will have the unique opportunity to take products from concept to production as we build towards our goal of becoming the global technology platform for the food industry. You will work closely with the co-founder team and be part of not just defining and implementing our technology and product strategy, but also the way we work together as we scale our company.</p><p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborative.</strong>&nbsp;You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together.</li><li><strong>Customer focused.</strong>&nbsp;User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if the customers don't enjoy using it.</li><li><strong>Disciplined and reliable.</strong>&nbsp;We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.</li><li><strong>Appreciative of honest feedback.</strong>&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</li><li><strong>Work smarter and harder.</strong>&nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.</li><li><strong>Analytical and practical mind.</strong>&nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.</li></ul><p><strong>Crisp’s tech stack</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Statically typed, modern languages.</strong>&nbsp;We use TypeScript and Kotlin, but knowledge of them is not a requirement and we’re happy to help you come up to speed.</li><li><strong>Continuous deployment.</strong>&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</li><li><strong>JVM based back-end.</strong>&nbsp;The JVM has a robust, rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that we’re leveraging to help us focus on building solutions, not tool-chains.</li><li><strong>Cloud first.</strong>&nbsp;As a services offering in the 21st century, the cloud isn’t the future, it’s the present. We’re fully invested in using the features offered by our cloud provider in order to minimize technical debt and maximize productivity.</li><li><strong>Micro-services.</strong>&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.</li></ul><p>We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific background, experience or geographical location. Instead we’re looking for individuals that are capable, reliable, and hoping to grow along with us. Do you have strengths you can share?

By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.\\n\\nWe are a remote-first company which means we give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living and working wherever you are most comfortable. We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth.\\n\\nAs a member of the first product engineering team at Crisp you have will have a unique opportunity to turn previously scattered and inconsistently structured data into directly actionable food industry insights to reduce waste, increase freshness and much more.\\n\\nYou have a proven track record of reading data and making solid conclusions. You know both the art&nbsp;and&nbsp;science of analytics - not only do you know how to find answers in the data, you also know which questions should be asked in the first place and what data can help us further bolster our conclusions.&nbsp;You love engaging with customers, learning about their challenges and then diving into the data to see how to solve them!\\n\\nSigns of a great candidate\\n\\n\\n* Collaborative.&nbsp;You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together.\\n\\n* Customer focused.&nbsp;User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if customers don't enjoy using it.\\n\\n* Disciplined and reliable.&nbsp;We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.\\n\\n* Appreciative of honest feedback.&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.\\n\\n* Work smarter and harder.&nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.\\n\\n* Analytical and practical mind.&nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCrisp’s tech stack\\n\\n\\n* Statically typed, modern languages.&nbsp;We use TypeScript and Kotlin, but knowledge of them is not a requirement and we’re happy to help you come up to speed.\\n\\n* Continuous deployment.&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.\\n\\n* JVM based back-end.&nbsp;The JVM has a robust, rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that we’re leveraging to help us focus on building solutions, not tool-chains.\\n\\n* Cloud first.&nbsp;As a services offering in the 21st century, the cloud isn’t the future, it’s the present.

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We’re pragmatic crafters who believe in smart and focused development, building clients’ products just as we do our own: investing heavily in design, iterating rapidly to validate and falsify ideas, and pursuing perfection in every interaction. We learned a lot of interesting things along the way about the right way to ship software, and we're now bringing our incredible software product experience to larger companies like <strong>Verizon, Google, Intel, Twitter, Sony, L'Oréal</strong>— and we do this all with a fully distributed team.<br><br></div><div>We believe that well-made software can change the world, no matter how small or simple a product might be. We also believe that poorly-made software —badly-designed, badly-developed, or badly-supported— is a preventable tragedy.<br><br></div><div>Mokriya’s mission is to make great software: for ourselves, for our clients and most importantly for our users.<br><br></div><div><strong>About You<br></strong><br></div><div>You love to build.

deliverables and sprints and keep the velocity even. &nbsp;We rarely work weekends (ok, sometimes if we have a good idea) and we try to keep things flexible. &nbsp;</p><p>This means you&nbsp;get to see your&nbsp;kids school plays and games, you can run errands when there's no traffic and so on. &nbsp;So if you are someone who can manage flexibility and still get your stuff done then we are a good fit. &nbsp;If you need a lot of structure and a boss who delights in holding&nbsp;your nose to the grindstone we wish you the best of luck.</p><p>It's a trade-off. &nbsp;We don't have as much collegiality as other places. &nbsp;We are just a solid place to do good work and feel good about the work you do.</p><p>We also have a very strict no a**holes policy. &nbsp;That goes for both clients and staff. &nbsp;We avoid clients who are not nice people. &nbsp;It's better that way. &nbsp;We are also fairly diverse. Come from different places, with different faces. &nbsp;But we&nbsp;all agree that being honest, direct, and decent is by far the simplest way for professionals to act. &nbsp;And when we fail we hope&nbsp;you'll tell us in an honest, direct, and decent way. &nbsp;And then work with us to improve.</p><p>A lot of our clients are in the public sector and we try to deliver value by helping our clients be more agile and get things done by cutting through their bureaucracy. &nbsp;We believe very much in the power of agile methods and practice them both at work and in our private lives. &nbsp;We hope you join us.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible work arrangements</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>High end hardware</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Time for side projects</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Despite being new to the market, Instilled is built on a mature product with a solid client base and consolidates a wealth of experience and technology from our parent group. We are a small, agile team in a much larger learning technology business that is successful and passionate about creating outstanding learning tools.\\n\\nWhat Instilled provides is a YouTube like experience for learners to discover content and progress at their own pace—it was originally a video platform, so included are a host of video features such as auto-captioning, auto-translation and commenting etc.\\n\\nWe are still in the early stages of this products transformation but we have huge aspirations and want developers that relish the opportunity to create industry-leading products.\\n\\nHow will I know this is for me?\\n\\nFirst, this is a UK-specific role.&nbsp;Candidates must be eligible to work in the UK.&nbsp;Our team does have a US component, but we are not currently hiring for&nbsp;any US roles.\\n\\nOur ideal candidate is friendly, enthusiastic and just as passionate about technology as we are. The team spans multiple offices and time-zones so a self-starter attitude and excellent communication skills are key. We know not everyone has experience of the learning industry but that’s fine, we want people that understand code. Our current tech stack is comprised of Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, AngularJS, and others. These things change though, so whilst prior experience is advantageous, the key is being able to adapt to whatever technology the task demands. We look for developers that have an opinion about how technology can be applied, but remain equally open minded about new or different approaches. Working well in a team is vital as this role will be fundamental in shaping our product architecture - clearly articulating a concept and nurturing other team members is hugely important.\\n\\nOk, sounds great! What do I do?\\n\\nThis is a unique opportunity to join a dynamic product team that is taking an impressive client list in to a whole new world of learning. If this sounds like a good fit then we would like to hear from you. Please send over a cover letter explaining why and attach your CV. Feel free to outline any achievements you are particularly proud of and include a link to code you can share. Extra points for your best joke!  </div> </div>",

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Apply by sending your resume to hiring@narrative.io.</p><p>We are hiring for the backend role and are building the team with a remote-first mindset.</p><p>- Scala Backend Engineer: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/join/backend.html' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/join/backend.html</a></p><p>Some more useful links:</p><p>- Find out more about Company Culture: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/culture' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/culture</a>.</p>",

They've asked me to find a people with lots of enthusiasm, ambition, questions (always find ways to improve!) and, of course, talent!</p> \n <p>They are very well set up for remote working, and, with disparate teams scattered across the UK and Europe, it is part of their culture.</p> \n <p>You'll join a team of like-minded Developers who you can learn from and contribute to. Currently, they are undergoing a number of large, transforming projects that will see you, amongst other things, building a new eCommerce platform from the ground up that will be visible across the world! For this, you'll need creative thinking (how can we do this best?), patience (why won't this work?), know-how (ah, that's how you do it!), and a collaborative mind-set (I'll go and tell others how I did it!). You'll also need to be comfortable working in an Agile environment, using DevOps practices, and using cloud providers for a multitude of different things. Therefore, if you come from a narrow-viewed Java background- i.e. where you've not been exposed to the full stack- you probably won't be right for this role.</p> \n <p>You won't be someone whose favourite spot in a room is the corner. On your own. With nobody to talk to… You'll be a lively person who enjoys communicating your ideas with others- be that in person or via an online communication tool.</p> \n <p>At a glance, the skills you'll need experience with are:</p> \n <p>Essential:</p> \n <ul>\n  <li>Java (knowledge around versions 8-11)</li>\n  <li>Spring/Spring Boot</li>\n  <li>REST APIs</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Good to know:</p> \n <ul>\n  <li>NoSQL DB technologies such as Mongo, Cassandra etc.</li>\n  <li>Kubernetes &amp; docker</li>\n  <li>Jenkins</li>\n  <li>AWS</li>\n  <li>Reactive programming (i.e. Spring Webflux)&quot;</li>\n  <li>Test Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/ CD)</li>\n </ul>\n <p>You'll get a rewarding role that will see you contributing to a team and projects in which you'll be able to see the fruits of your labour and in which you'll have a genuine say in the direction of the project you're working on- it's always a team effort.</p> \n <p>The salary on offer for the roles is rather open and ranges between £35-55k plus benefits, and the role is based in Nottingham.</p> \n <p>If you feel you'd be a good match for the role, then please either apply or give me a buzz to discuss it J</p> \n <p><strong>Mid-Snr Java Developer- Nottingham - £35-55k</strong></p>\n</div>",

We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of accountability, personal impact and career growth. \n  <br> \n  <br>As a member of the first few engineering teams at Crisp you have will have unique opportunity to take products from concept to production as we build towards our goal of becoming the global technology platform for the food industry. You will work closely with the co-founder team and be part of not just defining and implementing our technology and product strategy, but also the way we work together as we scale our company. \n  <br> \n  <br>Demonstrated technical impact is a requirement, but management experience is not. We know that great products are built by collaborative individuals, not by managers. We also know that many amazing developers can be excellent managers, but that's often not what they prefer.
