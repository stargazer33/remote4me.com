How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                                <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 Medical, Dental and Vision Plans                            </div>                            <div>                                 Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Commuter Benefits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Health Savings Accounts (HSA)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Employee Assistance Program (EAP)                            </div>                            <div>                                 Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.                            </div>                    "

Experience in security testing and commercial deployment of distributed systems is highly beneficial, as well as a sincere love of problem solving.</p><p>You should be an excellent Enterprise Java developer and problem solver, with a strong grounding in mathematics.

All we care about is whether you are world class at what you do.</p><p><strong>WORKING AT RADIX</strong></p><p>We believe strongly in both the importance of team bonding and benefits of flexible/remote working. For Radix, this means an initial period where you MUST be located with our CTO, Dan, in Stoke, England for a minimum of 3 months.

Tired of corporate awareness training, pointless meetings, bloviating managers, and political games? Looking for an environment that hires great engineers, gives them the tools to do great things, and expects them to do so?</p><p>Pyrofex is hiring. Come do your best work.</p><p><strong>About Us</strong></p><p>Pyrofex Corporation is one of Utah Valley's newest cryptocurrency startups. Founded in the Spring of 2016 by ex-Googlers Mike Stay and Nash Foster, Pyrofex is working hard to create the next-generation of blockchain platforms and decentralized applications.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>At Pyrofex, we hire for strength, and not for lack of weakness. We hire for capability and talent, not specific knowledge of a tool or language. We believe real innovation requires constant learning and learning requires constant failure. Nobody learns to ride a bike until they skin their knee. One of our founders has a Ph.D., but the other one dropped out of college. (Twice!) The path we've taken to get this far is unique and we suspect the same will be true of our best employees.</p><p>Pyrofex hires engineers at all levels of experience—from current students, to recent graduates, to academics, to engineers with decades of experience. We are particularly interested in programmers that have knowledge of functional programming, a background in computer science, and can program in Scala. However, if you think this job is a fit for you, we're willing to take a look.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>We are currently hiring Software Engineers to help us deliver the RChain platform, which is written in Scala. Developers on this team will design, implement, test, deploy, and manage a large-scale global software system using Linux, Scala, the JVM, C/C++, and Python.</p><p>Design and architecture requires you to work well with others, take their amorphous sets of needs and use cases, and distill these into written designs and specifications. Good implementations require a fastidious attention to detail, knowledge of your programming tools, and the ability to produce working, correct code on the regular. Pyrofex builds cryptocurrency systems and large-scale distributed and decentralized applications. Five years ago, we thought things like SRE and DevOps would make it clear what &quot;deploy and manage&quot; meant for the future, and now we know we were wrong. The future is changing too fast and our job is to try to keep up. That said, from time to time, we all have to get out of bed at 2AM to deal with something broken.</p><p>If this sounds good to you, then e-mail us at <strong><a href='mailto:jobs@pyrofex.net' rel='nofollow'>jobs@pyrofex.net</a></strong> with the subject line, &quot;AWWWWWW YEAH SIGN ME UP.&quot; We would like to see a resume or your linkedin profile. We would enjoy a cover letter in which you tell us about your work ethic and your favorite project. If you can send us examples of your code, that would be most excellent.</p>                    </div>                                        <h2>Benefits</h2>                            <div>                                 New Technologies                            </div>                            <div>                                 Work with a highly intelligent and productive team                            </div>                            <div>                                 Full Health benefits                            </div>                            <div>                                 Great communication amongst the team                            </div>                            <div>                                 Build from the ground up and make progress!                            </div>                            <div>                                 Remote Work Available                            </div>                    "

If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. We greatly limit the number of interns we work with in each division. Applications are now being taken for start dates in late May/early June 2018</p><p>Hashtags, yay!</p><p>No, that's not what we do. </p><p>So, what DO we do? <br>Data-driven, machine learning-infused social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>• Total social media optimization - avoid paying for ads by intelligently automating everything shared to social with images, GIFs, emojis, influencer-tagging. Come up in social search, get curated and republished, and make a visual impact as well.<br>•  Hashtags that are recommended based on current engagement and outcomes, rather than whether they are &quot;trending&quot; (trending = many accounts sending posts with a hashtag; it says nothing about positive outcomes).<br> <br>What you will experience:<br>•  Building not only Android applications, but also a powerful Android extension - a skill that very few mobile developers can claim<br>•  Learn from mentors and peer feedback in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>•  Brainstorm and implement app features<br>•  Build the fully functional app from start to finish<br>•  Exposure to Rest APIs<br>•  We make you part of the process, so you can earn how to bootstrap your own startup, in case you want to do that<br>•  We ship fast - and with over 230,000 registrations, when we make your latest feature live, your work will be seen and become part of the workflow for thousands of business people.</p><p>FIRM REQUIREMENTS:<br>•  Mac / Macbook / Hackintosh<br>•  Must write clean, re-usable code (we will test you)<br>•  3 months X 20 hours/week commitment<br>•  Our internships are UNPAID. No salary, no stipend, etc. Can lead to a salaried full-time or part-time position, depending on your work, our revenue growth and your availability.<br>•  Desire to work in a startup environment, able to self-manage and work remotely* <br>•  Fluency with Java required. <br>•  Must have built at least one Android app<br>•  Git experience</p><p>* Remotely = you work as we all do, from home or where we live.</p><p>Beneficial but not required:<br>•  Dart and Flutter Framework<br>•  Basic understanding of Android extensions/custom keyboards<br>•  TDD/Testing frameworks awareness (JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, etc.)<br> <br>* As a self-funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends who have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time. Should you be selected for a first interview, please do insist on learning what our interns go on to do, either as RiteKit salaried staff or after RiteKit. We'll give you ways to research this.</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers.</p></div>"
