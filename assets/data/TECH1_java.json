They've asked me to find a people with lots of enthusiasm, ambition, questions (always find ways to improve!) and, of course, talent!</p> \n <p>They are very well set up for remote working, and, with disparate teams scattered across the UK and Europe, it is part of their culture.</p> \n <p>You'll join a team of like-minded Developers who you can learn from and contribute to. Currently, they are undergoing a number of large, transforming projects that will see you, amongst other things, building a new eCommerce platform from the ground up that will be visible across the world! For this, you'll need creative thinking (how can we do this best?), patience (why won't this work?), know-how (ah, that's how you do it!), and a collaborative mind-set (I'll go and tell others how I did it!). You'll also need to be comfortable working in an Agile environment, using DevOps practices, and using cloud providers for a multitude of different things. Therefore, if you come from a narrow-viewed Java background- i.e. where you've not been exposed to the full stack- you probably won't be right for this role.</p> \n <p>You won't be someone whose favourite spot in a room is the corner. On your own. With nobody to talk to… You'll be a lively person who enjoys communicating your ideas with others- be that in person or via an online communication tool.</p> \n <p>At a glance, the skills you'll need experience with are:</p> \n <p>Essential:</p> \n <ul>\n  <li>Java (knowledge around versions 8-11)</li>\n  <li>Spring/Spring Boot</li>\n  <li>REST APIs</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Good to know:</p> \n <ul>\n  <li>NoSQL DB technologies such as Mongo, Cassandra etc.</li>\n  <li>Kubernetes &amp; docker</li>\n  <li>Jenkins</li>\n  <li>AWS</li>\n  <li>Reactive programming (i.e. Spring Webflux)&quot;</li>\n  <li>Test Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/ CD)</li>\n </ul>\n <p>You'll get a rewarding role that will see you contributing to a team and projects in which you'll be able to see the fruits of your labour and in which you'll have a genuine say in the direction of the project you're working on- it's always a team effort.</p> \n <p>The salary on offer for the roles is rather open and ranges between £35-55k plus benefits, and the role is based in Nottingham.</p> \n <p>If you feel you'd be a good match for the role, then please either apply or give me a buzz to discuss it J</p> \n <p><strong>Mid-Snr Java Developer- Nottingham - £35-55k</strong></p>\n</div>",

Now we’re building an ambitious language distribution platform so that no engineer ever has to suffer dependency hell again, and we need your help to do it! \n  <br> \n  <br>This position is open to full-time telecommuters anywhere in North America. You can also choose to work from our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC. \n  <br> \n  <br>This position is open to both junior (including fresh out of school) and senior applicants. The salary for this position will be commensurate with your experience. \n  <br> \n  <br>What You’ll be Doing \n  <br> \n  <br>As a Data Engineer, you will create and maintain a data processing pipeline to feed our automated build systems with information about various open source languages and package updates. This work includes automating processing of open source package update feeds from language repositories including PyPI (Python), CPAN (Perl), Maven (Java), NPM (JavaScript), RubyGems. You will also be creating web crawlers for eco-systems without well defined APIs. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our day to day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development with Pivotal Tracker as our project management tool. We’re always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so. \n  <br> \n  <br>We’re a polyglot company building our system using Golang, Python, Elm, Javascript, Perl, Docker, Kubernetes, DCOS, CircleCI, and other modern tools. Quality is as important as speed. We’re building for the long run, so you’ll need to enjoy writing tests and documentation too. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Highfive for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and Google Drive. \n  <br> \n  <br>We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code. \n  <br> \n  <br>Working at ActiveState \n  <br> \n  <br>ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We’re all about working together to find the best solutions, and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all of us. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our company is a team of 40+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles&nbsp; including software development and QA. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we’re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly don’t lack for ambition! But even though we’re ambitious we don’t expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches. \n  <br> \n  <br>What’s in it for You \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The chance to work on a project that will change the work lives of developers around the world. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Competitive salary, bonus, and stock option plan. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Requirements \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience creating and maintaining complex software systems along with the ability to design non-trivial applications and components from scratch. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The ability to write clean, well-tested code with clear documentation. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Deep experience with at least one programming language, and shallow experience with several. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical. You’ll need to work closely with your developer teammates, as well as be able to have coherent conversations with people from QA, sales, marketing, and other parts of the company. \n  <br> \n  <br>* A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The ability to help others on the team become better at their jobs through mentoring, thoughtful code reviews, and generally being a team player. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Assets \n  <br> \n  <br>If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Data processing technologies, including but not limited to Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Presto, Luigi, Airflow, Storm, etc. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Golang code, especially large code bases. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Microservices and message queues. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Docker and Kubernetes. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Perl, Python, Tcl, or Ruby, especially an understanding of their respective language communities and toolchains. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

Unsere Kunden sind anspruchsvolle Fotografen, Designer, Agenturen und Firmen, denen wir ein komfortables SaaS-Tool zum Versand von Bilddaten an die Hand geben. Über 300 Millionen Bilder wurden bisher mit PicDrop verschickt.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>Seit unserer Gründung 2014 arbeiten wir primär daran, unsere Nutzer glücklich zu machen. In unserer täglichen Arbeit richten wir uns daher konsequent nach ihren Bedürfnissen, was sich in Deiner Arbeit und sinnvollen Aufgaben widerspiegeln wird. Mit Dir möchten wir unser Team für eine langfristige Weiterentwicklung vergrößern.</p>\n <p><strong>Die Herausforderung</strong></p>\n <p>Kern von PicDrop bildet unsere PHP-Webanwendung, die sich aufgrund des Wachstums nach und nach in eine Service-Architektur verwandelt und gemeinsam mit Dir noch weiter ausgebaut werden soll. Insbesondere Performance-kritische Teile werden dabei als Java-Services umgesetzt. Die sich dabei entwickelnde Microservice-Architektur bringt neue Herausforderungen mit sich, die es zu bewältigen gilt.</p>\n <p>Bisher ist unser Frontend der Fokus unserer Backend-Services. Nach und nach gesellen sich dazu weitere APIs, die wir für Drittanbieter zur Verfügung stellen. Gleichzeitig integrieren wir kontinuierlich andere Dienste mit Hilfe deren Schnittstellen in unser Produkt.</p>\n <p>Aufgabe im Backend ist es, mit der ständig wachsenden Menge der zu verarbeitenden Daten Schritt zu halten und auch neue Technologien dafür in Betracht zu ziehen.</p>\n <p><strong>Deine Aufgaben</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Entwicklung neuer Funktionen in Zusammenarbeit mit deinem Entwicklungsteam</li>\n  <li>Kontinuierliche Anpassung an neue Skalierungsanforderungen</li>\n  <li>Unterstützung bei der Modernisierung bestehender Anwendungsteile unseres Backends&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Migration des Software Monolithen in eine skalierbare Softwarearchitektur</li>\n  <li>Gemeinsame Weiterentwicklung der Gesamtarchitektur im Entwicklungsteam</li>\n  <li>Beteiligung an unserem gesamten Entwicklungsprozess</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Was du mitbringen solltest</strong></p>\n <p>Statt für Deine Abschlüsse interessieren wir uns viel mehr für Deine konkreten Fähigkeiten, Deine letzten Projekte, Deinen Github-Account, Dein Blog – sprich: für Dein Können und Deine Persönlichkeit.</p>\n <p>Folgendes ist uns dennoch wichtig:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Mehrjährige (mind. 2 Jahre) Projekt- oder Produkterfahrung</li>\n  <li>Umfassende Kenntnisse in der Entwicklung von Java-Services mit Spring Boot</li>\n  <li>Sicherer Umgang mit SQL (MySQL, Postgres), NoSQL und REST-APIs</li>\n  <li>Erfahrungen im Umgang mit verteilten Systemen (Service-Discovery, Leader-Election, etc.) sind von Vorteil</li>\n  <li>Kenntnisse über die wichtigsten Web-Protokolle und sichere Arbeit mit diesen</li>\n  <li>Fundierte Erfahrungen im Umgang mit Microservices und deren typischen Stolperfallen</li>\n  <li>Projekt- oder Produkterfahrung mit anderen Programmiersprachen (z.

Our speak up culture is strong. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Remote first:&nbsp;Our team is fully distributed, and we work hard at that, but feel free to work from any of our offices in Paris, London, Brussels or Casablanca. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The courage to fail:&nbsp;We celebrate the wins, but more importantly we're not afraid to fail, we always learn and go again. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Team Unity: No one is left behind. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Code quality:&nbsp;It's not software without tests. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What will be your role? \n  <br> \n  <br>We're hiring for talent, not location, that is why you will find members of our group based remotely throughout Europe. You'll join one of our cross-functional product team and will be its proud Android representative. There are plenty of challenges each of them are tackling at the moment such as: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Driver team: create a scalable and reliable platform used by dozen of thousands of drivers on a daily basis \n  <br> \n  <br>* Payment team: make in-app payment management easy as pie for users. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Ride flow team: improve our ride flow by making it more modular while we are expanding in new countries with completely different approaches of using the product \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>... and many others! \n  <br> \n  <br>Does it sound like you? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* You have 5 years of experience or more in Android development and you still like it. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Thanks to your advanced knowledge of Rx, you can write complete use cases with flatMaps, concats, zips and are not afraid to jump from one scheduler to another. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Though you could write a book about Java, you now only want to deal with data/sealed classes, extension functions and know the difference between apply/with/also/run/let. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You know enough about Fragments, Activities, savedInstanceStates &amp; Parcelables to know what you want to work with on your next project, and what you sincerely want to see burn. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You're in love with ConstraintLayout, can make art out of Canvas and build custom views when the framework is just not enough. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You know the difference between unit &amp; automated tests, can write Rx-oriented test cases without wanting to die and know how to get everything running on a CI platform while you sleep. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You know when to use API or implementation in your gradle files and are not afraid of multi-modules projects. \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus. \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you have experience with background services, unreliable network conditions &amp; location updates, we'd love it. \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you know what kills the phone's battery and how to help mitigate the issue, we'd enjoy knowing more about it too. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What will you do? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work in a release train cycle (we ship often ). \n  <br> \n  <br>* Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of Android drivers \n  <br> \n  <br>* Be a vital member of the broader Android team at Heetch and contribute to core architecture and design discussions. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work closely with engineers from other product teams building cross-team features at scale. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Share knowledge with everyone and help your team to grow. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Have the freedom to experiment. Intrigued by a new tech or library? Go for it! Let's see how it improves our services. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Routinely own and manage releases to the Play store. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work on large cross-team projects. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What will be your main challenges? \n  <br> \n  <br>Our app is one, of the few mobile apps, running in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Network and GPS management: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking. \n  <br> \n  <br>* UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience. \n  <br> \n  <br>* One way data flow and functional pattern: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What's next? \n  <br> \n  <br>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps: \n  <br> \n  <br>* Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Take home assignment (~5 days deadline) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Interview with your future teammates (1h) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders \n  <br> \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

Our speak up culture is strong.</li>\n  <li><strong>Remote first</strong>:&nbsp;Our team is fully distributed, and we work hard at that, but feel free to work from any of our offices in Paris, London, Brussels or Casablanca.</li>\n  <li><strong>The courage to fail</strong>:&nbsp;We celebrate the wins, but more importantly we're not afraid to fail, we always learn and go again.</li>\n  <li><strong>Team Unity</strong>: No one is left behind.</li>\n  <li><strong>Code quality</strong>:&nbsp;It's not software without tests.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What will be your role?</strong></p>\n <p>We're hiring for talent, not location, that is why you will find members of our group based remotely throughout Europe. You'll join one of our cross-functional product team and will be its proud Android representative. There are plenty of challenges each of them are tackling at the moment such as:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Driver team: create a scalable and reliable platform used by dozen of thousands of drivers on a daily basis</li>\n  <li>Payment team: make in-app payment management easy as pie for users.</li>\n  <li>Ride flow team: improve our ride flow by making it more modular while we are expanding in new countries with completely different approaches of using the product</li>\n </ul>\n <p>... and many others!</p>\n <p><strong>Does it sound like you?</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You have <strong>5 years of experience</strong> or more in Android development and you still like it.</li>\n  <li>Thanks to your advanced knowledge of <strong>Rx</strong>, you can write complete use cases with flatMaps, concats, zips and are not afraid to jump from one scheduler to another.</li>\n  <li>Though you could write a book about Java, you now only want to deal with data/sealed classes, extension functions and know the difference between apply/with/also/run/let.</li>\n  <li>You know enough about Fragments, Activities, savedInstanceStates &amp; Parcelables to know what you want to work with on your next project, and what you sincerely want to see burn.</li>\n  <li>You're in love with <strong>ConstraintLayout</strong>, can make art out of Canvas and build custom views when the framework is just not enough.</li>\n  <li>You know the difference between <strong>unit &amp; automated tests</strong>, can write Rx-oriented test cases without wanting to die and know how to get everything running on a<strong> CI platform</strong> while you sleep.</li>\n  <li>You know when to use API or implementation in your gradle files and are not afraid of multi-modules projects.</li>\n  <li>If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.</li>\n  <li>If you have experience with background services, unreliable network conditions &amp; location updates, we'd love it.</li>\n  <li>If you know what kills the phone's battery and how to help mitigate the issue, we'd enjoy knowing more about it too.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features. </li>\n  <li>Work in a release train cycle (we ship often ).</li>\n  <li>Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of Android drivers</li>\n  <li>Be a vital member of the broader Android team at Heetch and contribute to core architecture and design discussions.</li>\n  <li>Work closely with engineers from other product teams building cross-team features at scale.</li>\n  <li>Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues.</li>\n  <li>Share knowledge with everyone and help your team to grow.</li>\n  <li>Have the freedom to experiment. Intrigued by a new tech or library? Go for it! Let's see how it improves our services.</li>\n  <li>Routinely own and manage releases to the Play store.</li>\n  <li>Work on large cross-team projects.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What will be your main challenges?</strong></p>\n <p>Our app is one, of the few mobile apps, running in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li>\n  <li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li>\n  <li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What's next?</strong></p>\n <p>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps:</p>\n <ol>\n  <li>Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30)</li>\n  <li>Take home assignment (~5 days deadline)</li>\n  <li>Interview with your future teammates (1h)</li>\n  <li>Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders</li>\n </ol> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/heetch/031b3ac7-dae4-4c7b-bef6-760f6990e2ea?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=StackOverflow' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>About Heetch</h4> \n<div>\n <p>Heetch is a mobility app with a simple mission: We want people to enjoy going out.<br>Every night and every day, our drivers are doing their best to make their rides unforgettable and friendly!

The ideal person takes pride in building coherent and usable interfaces making it easy to use and operate on data. This role would allow you to take on on challenging problems, choose the right tools for the job and build elegant, scalable solutions. Your work as an experienced Java engineer will empower over 9,000 businesses around the world to provide great customer service, and will support the other senior engineers on your team. \n  <br> \n  <br>We leverage Solr for several tools at Help Scout. Knowledge or even expertise in Solr is desired. However, as our data needs grow we look beyond search and towards Big Data solutions. We are seeking someone who can join the team and help us solve all kinds of data processing and analysis problems. \n  <br> \n  <br>Currently at Help Scout \n  <br>* We develop in Java, Kotlin, JavaScript and PHP \n  <br>* We leverage AWS, RabbitMQ, Aurora MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Apache Solr \n  <br>* We also use Slack, Jira, Trello, Github, Jenkins \n  <br> \n  <br># Responsibilities \n  <br> * You will be the fourth member of our search and data services team, collaborating on the next generation of our large-scale search and reporting service and associated infrastructure. On a daily basis, you'll work on adding new functionality, improving existing code, and API endpoints while maintaining focus on testing and documentation. \n  <br>* We currently index millions of search and report events every day and at peak hours our API handles tens of thousands of transactions a minute. You will play a key role in evolving our services to handle 10X that. \n  <br>* You will own some of our large, upcoming challenges and collaborate with your team on all of these: building a streaming data reports pipeline, reworking how we index data and retrieve data to scale while controlling infrastructure costs, and significantly improving our search relevancy and customer-facing reporting capabilities. \n  <br>* Our engineering team is over 40 people, more than half the company. As part of the search and data team you will be involved in the decisions made regarding implementation, testing, and backlog prioritization. You will collaborate with the rest of the engineering team through code, reviews. You will participate in making architectural discussion. \n  <br>* We work in using iterative software approach, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to remote, agile development. When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with tests and tag your team for review - using video and screen-sharing as needed. Your development builds can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive. \n  <br>* Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way. \n  <br>* Everything is secondary to the customer experience. We expect you to have a keen sense of how your code will impact the experience in terms of performance, security and usability. \n  <br>* You'll be working with product people that challenge you to get better every day. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy work that moves the needle for businesses around the world. \n  <br>* To ensure sufficient overlap with your teammates, we're looking for candidates that live in UTC+3 (Eastern Europe) and UTC-7 (as far as San Francisco) time zones. \n  <br> \n  <br># Requirements \n  <br>* You became an engineer because you like writing software that helps people. \n  <br>* You bring a level of Java-specific expertise that will help us craft an outstanding experience for customers and fellow developers. \n  <br>* You have experience building information systems and data processing platforms. \n  <br>* You are skilled in the modern tooling that is used in data processing and retrieval domain. Big Data, Streaming Pipelines, Data Grids and Data Lakes are not just buzzwords to you. \n  <br>* You are excited about JVM ecosystem. We also like Kotlin here. \n  <br>* You are a skilled and passionate engineer who is friendly, collaborative, and supportive. \n  <br>* You value personal growth and constructive feedback. \n  <br>* You demonstrate an empathetic, organized and collaborative communication style with fellow engineers and non-engineering stakeholders. \n  <br>* You will consider how your work impacts others, and demonstrate thoughtful, flexible approaches to mentoring and guiding technical decisions. \n  <br>* Your code is not only a pleasure for customers to use, but for other engineers to read and understand easily. \n  <br> \n  <br>#Location \n  <br>- Worldwide \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our Offer Team is now on the lookout for an experienced Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision. \n  <br> \n  <br>The Team \n  <br> \n  <br>The Offer Team is responsible for ensuring that the users of our Sportsbook platform are presented with relevant and fairly priced betting opportunities year-round and around the clock. The main deliverable of the team is a superpowered stream of betting opportunities, which is the result of: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* \n  <br> \n  <br>Aggregating information from third-party data sources \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* \n  <br> \n  <br>Implementing in-house statistical models to derive exotic betting opportunities from more simple ones \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* \n  <br> \n  <br>Implementing in-house pricing models to assist in offering ideal prices: attractive for end-users while also commercially viable for bookmakers \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* \n  <br> \n  <br>Determining the suitability of different types of betting opportunities in different jurisdictions and for different brands \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>The nature of the data handled by the team requires us to obey strict SLAs around the propagation times for any kind of update. Guaranteeing low latency is of utmost importance in order to prevent shrewd players taking advantage of stale data (e.g. odds taking too long to be updated after a goal is scored in a football match). \n  <br> \n  <br>You will be working on developing and improving our core services primarily in Scala and also have a voice in architectural discussions. \n  <br> \n  <br>Remote Work \n  <br> \n  <br>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location.

Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops. \n  <br> \n  <br>Compensation \n  <br> \n  <br>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €55k-75k annually, depending on your background and experience.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p>\n <p>Our Offer Team is now on the lookout for an experienced Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p>\n <p><strong>The Team</strong></p>\n <p>The Offer Team is responsible for ensuring that the users of our Sportsbook platform are presented with relevant and fairly priced betting opportunities year-round and around the clock. The main deliverable of the team is a superpowered stream of betting opportunities, which is the result of:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><p>Aggregating information from third-party data sources</p></li>\n  <li><p>Implementing in-house statistical models to derive exotic betting opportunities from more simple ones</p></li>\n  <li><p>Implementing in-house pricing models to assist in offering ideal prices: attractive for end-users while also commercially viable for bookmakers</p></li>\n  <li><p>Determining the suitability of different types of betting opportunities in different jurisdictions and for different brands</p></li>\n </ul>\n <p>The nature of the data handled by the team requires us to obey strict SLAs around the propagation times for any kind of update. Guaranteeing low latency is of utmost importance in order to prevent shrewd players taking advantage of stale data (e.g. odds taking too long to be updated after a goal is scored in a football match).</p>\n <p>You will be working on developing and improving our core services primarily in Scala and also have a voice in architectural discussions.</p>\n <p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p>\n <p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p>\n <p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>\n <p>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €55k-75k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p>\n <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><p>BS degree in Computer Science or similar technical field</p></li>\n  <li><p>2+ years of professional software development experience using Scala or a pure functional programming language</p></li>\n  <li><p>Interest and ability to keep yourself up to date and learn new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</p></li>\n  <li><p>Deep understanding of functional programming</p></li>\n  <li><p>Good knowledge of concurrent programming, as well as distributed systems</p></li>\n  <li><p>Good knowledge of microservice architecture, message-based communication and stream processing</p></li>\n  <li><p>Interest in test automation, cloud and containerization technologies, code instrumentation and CI/CD pipelines</p></li>\n  <li><p>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</p></li>\n  <li><p>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</p></li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/software-engineer-scala/c/new?source=Stack%20Overflow' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Competitive Compensation</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span> </li> \n</ul>",

However, your content samples should be long (1-2k+ words), in-depth (5-10+ stats per article), and instructive (images).</p>\n  <p>Here are the details.</p>\n  <p><b>Why work with us?</b></p>\n  <ol>\n   <li>We work with the best clients in the industry. Seriously. And if they aren’t, we’ll fire them. :) Because life’s too short to do soul-sucking work with soul-sucking people. We want to produce the best content imaginable for the best sites and the best people in the space. The plus side is that you get access to smart, low maintenance clients that’ll blow up that portfolio.</li>\n   <li>You will become a MUCH better writer in a very short amount of time. Why? Because you’ll write and write and write. We’ll give you the tools, support, training, and feedback to learn how to write more in less time. You’ll go from one article in eight hours to one in four. You do the math on that hourly rate.</li>\n   <li>You’ll have the freedom of being a freelance writer, like unlimited vacation, work your own hours, work with top-tier clients, eventually getting handed your own top-tier bylines, etc. Except, you won’t have to deal with all the headaches, like email, meetings, client management, billing, self-promotion, and more.</li>\n   <li>We’re 100% remote. So it doesn’t matter where you live or what hours you work. Our clients are spread across North America, Europe, and Australia. So we’re set-up to work across time zones, without requiring anyone to virtually punch a clock.</li>\n   <li>We always have extra work to go around. And we’ll pay you for content above and beyond your normal capacity. So in addition to the normal pay hikes as you get better (see below), we’ll always have extra work you can take on if you’re interested in working more or overtime.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p><b>Why you shouldn’t work with us?</b></p>\n  <ol>\n   <li>If you’re a ‘writer’ who doesn’t like to write, this position won’t work well for you. The good news is that we’ll strip away all of the other BS that distracts you from writing. Typically, that means full-time writers are putting in a solid 6-8 hours a day (half is usually research, the other half writing). No nights or weekends required (unless that’s when you like doing your thing). However, you’ll still be rolling up your sleeves and putting in some work.</li>\n   <li>You’ll write a lot, sure. But to be honest, most of that time should be spent researching. Because there’s a huge difference in writing about truck tires for a generic audience and writing about currency swaps to an audience of savvy, high-net-worth individuals. So you can’t just make $#!^ up. You’ll need to leverage examples, quotes, stats, and screenshots to justify your claims. We’ll show you how to find all of these things, faster and easier, so that your actual time spent writing drops like a rock. Again, you’ll just have to be ready to do the work.</li>\n   <li>No, we won’t pay you $500+ per post to start. For a number of reasons, but mostly, you won’t be worth $500+ per post in the early goings. (Harsh, I know.) But we can pay you $5k per month to start if you’re good. And lots more, as you begin mastering client style guides, requiring less oversight from our team of editors. We don’t care if you’re 19 or 59. We want quality and will give you all the work and money available if you can deliver it.</li>\n   <li>We’re process-based. That means we have resources and checklists we want you to follow so that you can increase consistency and cut down on the time it takes to create an article. ‘Creatives’ might not like this disciplined approach. But we guarantee your ability to produce high-quality content will skyrocket within the first few months.</li>\n   <li>We’re super friendly. We want to support you and do anything possible to help you get better. But we can’t babysit and won’t BS you. If something’s not good, we’ll let you know. Nicely, but firmly. We’re all trying to get better on a daily basis. And that requires constant feedback from other people.</li>\n  </ol>\n  <p><b>Interested?</b> Please apply here: https://getcodeless.com/writer-investment-economics/</p>\n  <p>We’ll get in touch ASAP (today or tomorrow) if you look like a good fit.</p> \n </div> \n</div>",

We’re a 3 year-old startup with an exemplary 6 person team who are building an app called inapps. Become part of our dream of starting a company that will change society.\n<br>\n<br>Only direct applications from candidates please (i.e. no agencies or equivalent).\n<br>\n<br>As our Backend Java Developer, you’ll be be responsible for the Java code behind the API that our Android/iOS app uses. This code will be developed using the Micronaut Java framework and will run GraalVM (containerised using Docker; using this architecture, our non blocking Java microservices instances can be launched in 10s of milliseconds). We now need someone that wants to gain cutting edge server-side Java development experience building out the services needed for our app’s next features. You’ll have loads of support from our Backend Architect and me (co-founder and developer of the API and services behind it… till now).\n<br>\n<br>Our vision for inapps is to help people make the most of their spare time. So we’re creating an incredibly visual and simple place for lifestyle businesses to:\n<br>\n<br>sell their experiences and products in their own inapps which live in our app (like departments in a high end department store)\n<br>create a community with their clients using our Whatsapp-like chat feature\n<br>\n<br>We’re a very passionate team, so much so that we’ve come very far working in our spare time. This also has the advantage that we are forced to think very carefully about our product design and the customers we are working with. To give you a flavour of what we’re striving to create, check out our iOS/Android apps and website (please note that our website is under development):\n<br>\n<br>https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/simpleinapps/id1358702776?mt=8\n<br>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simpleinapps.android\n<br>https://simpleinapps.com \n<br>\n<br>\n<br>We stand for quality over deadlines; attention to detail over iterating wildly, and being friendly over competitive behaviour.\n<br>\n<br>Don’t forget you’ll be building something core to our business. You’ll get loads of support from me and our Backend Architect Will. He’s based in Munich, our iOS/Android Developer is based in Nigeria and I’m in London: so we don’t really care where you are based. Make sure you’re the sort of person who puts pride into the software you write and you’re within a bunch of timezones from London. We also don’t care when you work (full time is not necessary) as long as you make time for the team call.\n<br>\n<br>We want you to work with us for 10 weeks and for that we’ll pay £1k. But what we really want is someone to become part of the team afterwards.\n<br>\n<br>Meet the team:\n<br>\n<br>Me, Head of Tech and Co-Founder - https://uk.linkedin.com/in/hodgsonstuart\n<br>Pascal, Head of Customers and Co-Founder - https://www.linkedin.com/in/pascalpieper/ \n<br>Will, Backend Architect - https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-hornsby-b36a2b135/\n<br>Teo, Customers DACH - https://www.linkedin.com/in/teodortoshkin/\n<br>Lachezar, Design - https://www.linkedin.com/in/lachezar-stamatov-750153112/\n<br>Joseph, Android/iOS Developer - https://www.linkedin.com/in/josephdalughut \n<br>\n<br>Excited?

Scale, reliability, and innovation keep us learning on daily basis. You will join our server-side team to enhance and maintain our server-side Java 8 and Kotlin applications. \n  <br> \n  <br>We have distributed systems hosted in AWS, which are presented to our users through an AngularJS frontend. \n  <br> \n  <br>Moving forward, the biggest challenge we face is scaling our systems to work with large data-sets and high system load. You’ll help us build systems that can easily scale up and down the number of processing nodes as needed and implement rate-limiting to ensure rogue systems don’t impact our SLAs for other applications. \n  <br> \n  <br>Additionally, you’ll improve the performance of our main data store by adding or changing indexes as appropriate, add caching functionality where possible and set up monitoring to catch performance bottlenecks early on. \n  <br> \n  <br>Culture and Work Environment \n  <br> \n  <br>As a fully remote team, communication is extremely important - there is no chance to drop in on interesting discussions around the water cooler or to see if someone is busy just by glancing at their desk. We have systems to signal busy-ness; regular meetings and stand-ups to disseminate information, frequent one-on-ones to ensure there are no frustrations building up, a code of conduct and a formal complaint process to resolve conflicts early-on. \n  <br> \n  <br>As a key member of our server-side team, you’ll specifically be expected to: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Design and build API endpoints for our internal and public APIs \n  <br> \n  <br>* Architect efficient task scheduling and processing systems \n  <br> \n  <br>* Keep up-to-date on new AWS features and integrate them into our tech stack if appropriate \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work closely with the VP of Engineering to adapt and develop our architecture and systems \n  <br> \n  <br>* Implement monitoring systems for performance bottlenecks on our main data store \n  <br> \n  <br>* Determine through performance profiling where to add caching to our distributed systems and internal interfaces \n  <br> \n  <br>* Monitor the growth of our data-sets and assist in creating strategies to address the systems where growth could become an issue \n  <br> \n  <br>* Write effective high-quality code with a focus on performance and maintainability \n  <br> \n  <br>* Create reliable tests and work closely with our QA team for end-to-end testing \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Requirements: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* You thrive in a self-directed and open work environment. There’s no boss breathing down your neck, no deadlines, no fixed work hours and no in-office requirements. It’s&nbsp;really important&nbsp;that you can manage your time well, and you know what you need in order to do your job well (e.g. what work hours to pick so you have enough time to communicate with team members effectively) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Deep knowledge of the OOP paradigm, experience with functional programming and other approaches is a plus \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience building complex systems with many moving parts, such as different protocols, varying restrictions on latency or CAP parameters \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience building and maintaining CI/CD systems is a bonus \n  <br> \n  <br>* Excellent knowledge of static type systems and compiled languages \n  <br> \n  <br>* Deep knowledge of various data stores such as SQL, document stores, key-value stores or queuing systems, as well as their performance characteristics and scalability issues \n  <br> \n  <br>* Good understanding of caching and cache invalidation strategies \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Interested? \n  <br> \n  <br>Lasso’s vision is to be the technology hub for new home sales in North America by providing a unique combination of remarkable software and expert services.

We have high standards and high expectations on our output, we ship fast, and we scale our work for all markets. To achieve this, we’re all working together with Product Managers, Mobile &amp; Backend Devs, Designers, Data Analysts &amp; Scientists and Operation teams to successfully target structural next steps, deliver, track and iterate. \n  <br> \n  <br>What will be your role? \n  <br> \n  <br>You will improve the ride flow on both the passengers and drivers side by making it more modular to improve its scalability. Due to our expansion in new countries, you will have to build a product that can adapt and deal with both technical and cultural challenges. \n  <br> \n  <br>Does it sound like you? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* You have more than 5 years of experience in Android development and you still like it. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Thanks to your advanced knowledge of Rx, you can write complete use cases with flatMaps, concats, zips and are not afraid to jump from one scheduler to another. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Though you could write a book about Java, you now only want to deal with data/sealed classes, extension functions and know the difference between apply/with/also/run/let. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You know enough about Fragments, Activities, savedInstanceStates &amp; Parcelables to know what you want to work with on your next project, and what you sincerely want to see burn. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You're in love with ConstraintLayout, can make art out of Canvas and build custom views when the framework is just not enough. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You know the difference between unit &amp; automated tests, can write Rx-oriented test cases without wanting to die and know how to get everything running on a CI platform while you sleep. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You know when to use api or implementation in your gradle files and are not afraid of multi-modules projects. \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus. \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you have experience with background services, unreliable network conditions &amp; location updates, we'd love it. \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you know what kills the phone's battery and how to help mitigate the issue, we'd enjoy knowing more about it too. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What will you do? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Scientist teams to build highly impactful features \n  <br> \n  <br>* Optimise performance and help to solve technical and product problems for our large pool of Android users \n  <br> \n  <br>* Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your co-workers \n  <br> \n  <br>* Have the freedom to experiment. Intrigued in new tech or library? Go for it! let's see how it improves our app. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Be a key member of the wider Android team at Heetch and contribute to core architecture and design discussions \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What are going to be your main challenges? \n  <br> \n  <br>Our app is one, of the few mobile apps, running in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Network and GPS management: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking. \n  <br> \n  <br>* UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience. \n  <br> \n  <br>* One way data flow and functional pattern: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What's next? \n  <br> \n  <br>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps: \n  <br> \n  <br>* Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Take home assignment (~5 days deadline) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Interview with your future teammates (1h) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders \n  <br> \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

We work hand in hand with the Data, Product and Operations teams to improve our product while protecting our bankrolls and maintaining compliance and cleanliness in our accounting records: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Numbers, numbers everywhere. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We help users manage their payment methods and coupons, a crucial part of the passenger on-boarding experience. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We make sure drivers get paid on time for their work by providing them with a seamless experience so they don’t have to worry about their money. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Fraudsters are like zombies, one breach, and you’ll face an army of them. \n  <br> \n  <br>* 1 cent can become over 9000 cents if you don’t pay attention. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Android within Payment Team \n  <br> \n  <br>As a mobile developer, your job will be to work on the interfaces, for example, to help passengers managing their payment methods/coupons or drivers understanding how much they earn on the platform. You want to make sure people can know what's going on with their money \n  <br> \n  <br>Our team's values \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Transparency: We discuss everything openly within the team. Our speak up culture is strong. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Remote first:&nbsp;Our team is fully distributed, and we work hard at that, but feel free to work from any of our offices in Paris, London, Brussels or Casablanca. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The courage to fail:&nbsp;We celebrate the wins, but more importantly we're not afraid to fail, we always learn and go again. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Team Unity: No one is left behind. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Code quality:&nbsp;It's not software without tests. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Does it sound like you? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* You have more than 5 years of experience in Android development and you still like it. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Thanks to your advanced knowledge of Rx, you can write complete use cases with flatMaps, concats, zips and are not afraid to jump from one scheduler to another. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Though you could write a book about Java, you now only want to deal with data/sealed classes, extension functions and know the difference between apply/with/also/run/let. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You know enough about Fragments, Activities, savedInstanceStates &amp; Parcelables to know what you want to work with on your next project, and what you sincerely want to see burn. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You're in love with ConstraintLayout, can make art out of Canvas and build custom views when the framework is just not enough. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You know the difference between unit &amp; automated tests, can write Rx-oriented test cases without wanting to die and know how to get everything running on a CI platform while you sleep. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You know when to use api or implementation in your gradle files and are not afraid of multi-modules projects. \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus. \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you have experience with background services, unreliable network conditions &amp; location updates, we'd love it. \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you know what kills the phone's battery and how to help mitigate the issue, we'd enjoy knowing more about it too. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What will you do? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work in a release train cycle (we ship often ) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of Android drivers \n  <br> \n  <br>* Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues \n  <br> \n  <br>* Have the freedom to experiment.

We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers.

My name is Emma. Nice to meet you!</p>\n <p>I’m the lead developer for a product called <a href='https://www.instilled.com/' rel='nofollow'>Instilled</a>, and we need your help building the best all-remote development team possible. You’ll be entrusted with the freedom and independence to go out and do your best work, and have the opportunity to make a real, outsized contribution to an entirely new culture and identity. And so, if that sounds appealing to you, read on: We’d like you to join us.</p>\n <p>Our product is a video delivery platform—think of it like an enterprise YouTube—but it has the potential to be something bigger. We believe it can form the core of a next-generation learning product that consolidates all of an organization’s learning content into a single platform, making it easy for learners to find relevant content and for companies to make sense of all the data these learning activities generate. This is a unique opportunity, because&nbsp;Instilled already has a stable and profitable customer base, but this new direction gives us the chance to tap into a large new market.</p>\n <p><br><strong>Requirements</strong><br>We have a lot of flexibility in who we can hire, but that’s not to say we aren’t picky! We’re looking for backend and frontend devs located in the United States or the United Kingdom and with experience levels spanning junior bootcamp grads to senior engineers. Precisely because this is an all-remote team, we take culture very seriously. We’re looking for developers who value what we value, namely:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Excellent communication skills.</strong> When your team is remote, every interaction counts!</li>\n  <li><strong>Self-directedness.</strong> You own your work and take responsibility for getting it done because your team members are counting on you. Sometimes this means going heads down and just coding. Sometimes it means knowing when to ask for help. But, in all cases, you are the engine driving your work to completion.</li>\n  <li><strong>Helpfulness.</strong> There is nothing worse in a remote position than feeling stuck. That’s why it’s important to be the kind of person who is willing to help a coworker—to offer insight from when you’ve worked on that same code or to rubber-duck a difficult bug—because we’re all in this together and we’ll all need it in return someday.</li>\n  <li><strong>“Reading Comprehension.”</strong> We aren’t building an app from the ground up; there is a product with a storied history here, written by people who knew what they were doing. You need to be able to make sense of other people’s legacy code and change it carefully.</li>\n  <li><strong>Flexibility.</strong> Our current tech stack is comprised of Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, Angular, and others, but things change. Prior experience with these is not required—we know that skilled developers come from all backgrounds—but you must be more than able to adapt to whatever technology the task demands.</li>\n  <li><strong>Willingness to speak up.</strong> We have a lot of things to figure out—from considering far-reaching architectural decisions, to configuring our linter for tabs or spaces, to figuring out an optimal meeting schedule, to creating an even more welcoming space for our team. We want people who aren’t afraid to speak up and push to make things better.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>How to apply</strong><br>If this sounds like you, include a cover letter in your application letting us know why you'd be a great fit for the team and what interests you about this job specifically. Tell us about the kind of developer you are, what motivates you, how you approach your work, and the kinds of problems you've solved—don't just list the technologies you've worked with. Better yet, tell us about a situation or project where&nbsp;you demonstrated one of the qualities listed above. If you have publicly available code that you're proud of, include a link to that, too.</p>\n <p>If you want, you may (but don't have to) include a résumé. But the letter is the most important part—make it count!&nbsp;(A résumé alone doesn’t let us get to know you well enough to determine whether we'd work well together.)</p>\n <p>We’re looking forward to hearing from you soon!</p>\n <p>Emma</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <h4>Reactions to this job</h4> \n <div> \n  <div> \n   <span>16</span> \n   <span>0</span> \n   <span>5</span> \n   <span>0</span> \n   <span>0</span> \n   <span>0</span> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div> \n  <div> \n   <div> \n    <div></div> \n   </div> \n   <div> \n    <strong>New!</strong> How do you feel about this job listing? \n   </div> \n   <div> \n   </div> \n  </div> \n </div> \n <div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n Company: gomo video | No office location\n <br>\n</div> \n<h4>Remote details</h4> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <div> \n   <span>Preferred Timezone:</span> \n   <span>(GMT-04:00) Atlantic Time - Halifax +/- 4 hours</span> \n  </div> \n </div> \n</div> \n<h4>Technologies</h4>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n java\n</div>\n<div>\n spring\n</div>\n<div>\n postgresql\n</div>\n<div>\n angular\n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://ltg.workable.com/jobs/955528/candidates/new' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Remote Team</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible Working</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Pension Contributions</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>ShareSave Scheme</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Discretionary Bonus Scheme</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Travel Loans</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Access to Perkbox</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Healthcare Cash Plan</span> </li> \n</ul>",

We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of accountability, personal impact and career growth.</p>\n <p>As a member of the first few engineering teams at Motiion you have will have unique opportunity to take products from concept to production as we build towards our goal of becoming the global technology platform for the food industry.</p>\n <p>You will work closely with the co-founder team and be part of not just defining and implementing our technology and product strategy, but also the way we work together as we scale our company.</p>\n <p>Demonstrated technical impact is a requirement, but management experience is not. We know that great products are built by collaborative individuals, not by managers. We also know that many amazing developers can be excellent managers, but that's often not what they prefer. Motiion values individual technical contribution and strongly believe it’s the key to Motiion’s success.&nbsp; The Motiion technology foundation is currently being designed and the following principles will apply:</p>\n <p><strong>Statically typed, modern language</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Typescript and Kotlin are our lingua franca(s).</p>\n <p><strong>Continuous deployment.</strong>&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, our branch time span are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</p>\n <p><strong>JVM based back-end.</strong>&nbsp;We believe in the robustness, richness and talent pool of the JVM and its ecosystem.</p>\n <p><strong>Cloud first.</strong>&nbsp;We leverage the differentiated features of the cloud we choose to maximize productivity. <strong>Micro-services.</strong>&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but for the sake of organizational benefits as we scale to achieve sustained, high feature velocity.</p>\n <p><strong>Platform first.</strong>&nbsp;Motiion is building an open platform for the entire food industry, including third party application developers. We dog-food the APIs we share with our customers and partners. We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific educational background, technology, experience or geographical location. We are however looking for specific traits in the people we work with. You might not yet be able to check all of the boxes, but at least you aspire to do so!&nbsp;</p>\n <p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong> <strong>Performance recognized by your peers.</strong>&nbsp;Past colleagues would love to work with you again.</p>\n <p><strong>Eager learner, careful adopter.</strong>&nbsp;New technologies arrive all the time and you are eager to learn about them. You do not, however, replace your entire tool-chain every year.</p>\n <p><strong>Starter and finisher.</strong>&nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - alone or with collaborators. You enjoy software development and recognize that not all tasks can be equally fun. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.</p>\n <p><strong>Productive.</strong>&nbsp;You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly.</p>\n <p><strong>Work hard and smart.</strong>&nbsp;Your work ethic is unquestioned, and you know how to get things done so you can balance your work and personal life in a sustainable way.</p>\n <p><strong>Disciplined and reliable.</strong>&nbsp;We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.</p>\n <p><strong>Collaborative.</strong>&nbsp;You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to make the team perform.</p>\n <p><strong>Appreciation of honest feedback.</strong>&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You feedback given to as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</p>\n <p><strong>Analytical and practical mind.</strong>&nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed.</p>\n <p><strong>Customer focused.</strong>&nbsp;User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if the customers don't enjoy using it.</p>\n <p><strong>Diligent, but pragmatic.</strong>&nbsp;You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://motiion.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j8nt?source=StackoverflowJobPosting' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>About Motiion</h4> \n<div>\n <p>Our main goals with Motiion are easy to explain: We want to build a company that we would like to&nbsp;<em>enjoy&nbsp;</em>spending the rest of our careers in, that has a positive impact on the world and that will outlast us.</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Fully remote</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Excellent health insurance and benefits</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Founders with proven track record</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Well funded (by founders)</span> </li> \n</ul>",

We have systems to signal busy-ness; regular meetings and stand-ups to disseminate information, frequent one-on-ones to ensure there are no frustrations building up, a code of conduct and a formal complaint process to resolve conflicts early-on.</p>\n <p><strong>As a key member of our server-side team, you’ll specifically be expected to:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Design and build API endpoints for our internal and public APIs</li>\n  <li>Architect efficient task scheduling and processing systems</li>\n  <li>Keep up-to-date on new AWS features and integrate them into our tech stack if appropriate</li>\n  <li>Work closely with the VP of Engineering to adapt and develop our architecture and systems</li>\n  <li>Implement monitoring systems for performance bottlenecks on our main data store</li>\n  <li>Determine through performance profiling where to add caching to our distributed systems and internal interfaces</li>\n  <li>Monitor the growth of our data-sets and assist in creating strategies to address the systems where growth could become an issue</li>\n  <li>Write effective high-quality code with a focus on performance and maintainability</li>\n  <li>Create reliable tests and work closely with our QA team for end-to-end testing</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You thrive in a self-directed and open work environment. There’s no boss breathing down your neck, no deadlines, no fixed work hours and no in-office requirements. It’s&nbsp;really important&nbsp;that you can manage your time well, and you know what you need in order to do your job well (e.g. what work hours to pick so you have enough time to communicate with team members effectively)</li>\n  <li>Deep knowledge of the OOP paradigm, experience with functional programming and other approaches is a plus</li>\n  <li>Experience building complex systems with many moving parts, such as different protocols, varying restrictions on latency or CAP parameters</li>\n  <li>Experience building and maintaining CI/CD systems is a bonus</li>\n  <li>Excellent knowledge of static type systems and compiled languages</li>\n  <li>Deep knowledge of various data stores such as SQL, document stores, key-value stores or queuing systems, as well as their performance characteristics and scalability issues</li>\n  <li>Good understanding of caching and cache invalidation strategies</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Interested?</p>\n <p>Lasso’s vision is to be the technology hub for new home sales in North America by providing a unique combination of remarkable software and expert services.

We have high standards and high expectations on our output, we ship fast, and we scale our work for all markets. To achieve this, we’re all working together with Product Managers, Mobile &amp; Backend Devs, Designers, Data Analysts &amp; Scientists and Operation teams to successfully target structural next steps, deliver, track and iterate.</p>\n <p><strong>What will be your role?</strong></p>\n <p>You will improve the ride flow on both the passengers and drivers side by making it more modular to improve its scalability. Due to our expansion in new countries, you will have to build a product that can adapt and deal with both technical and cultural challenges.</p>\n <p><strong>Does it sound like you?</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You have more than 5 years of experience in Android development and you still like it.</li>\n  <li>Thanks to your advanced knowledge of Rx, you can write complete use cases with flatMaps, concats, zips and are not afraid to jump from one scheduler to another.</li>\n  <li>Though you could write a book about Java, you now only want to deal with data/sealed classes, extension functions and know the difference between apply/with/also/run/let.</li>\n  <li>You know enough about Fragments, Activities, savedInstanceStates &amp; Parcelables to know what you want to work with on your next project, and what you sincerely want to see burn.</li>\n  <li>You're in love with ConstraintLayout, can make art out of Canvas and build custom views when the framework is just not enough.</li>\n  <li>You know the difference between unit &amp; automated tests, can write Rx-oriented test cases without wanting to die and know how to get everything running on a CI platform while you sleep.</li>\n  <li>You know when to use api or implementation in your gradle files and are not afraid of multi-modules projects.</li>\n  <li>If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.</li>\n  <li>If you have experience with background services, unreliable network conditions &amp; location updates, we'd love it.</li>\n  <li>If you know what kills the phone's battery and how to help mitigate the issue, we'd enjoy knowing more about it too.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Scientist teams to build highly impactful features</li>\n  <li>Optimise performance and help to solve technical and product problems for our large pool of Android users</li>\n  <li>Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your co-workers</li>\n  <li>Have the freedom to experiment. Intrigued in new tech or library? Go for it! let's see how it improves our app.</li>\n  <li>Be a key member of the wider Android team at Heetch and contribute to core architecture and design discussions</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What are going to be your main challenges?</strong></p>\n <p>Our app is one, of the few mobile apps, running in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Network and GPS management: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li>\n  <li>UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li>\n  <li>One way data flow and functional pattern: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What's next?</strong></p>\n <p>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps:</p>\n <ol>\n  <li>Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30)</li>\n  <li>Take home assignment (~5 days deadline)</li>\n  <li>Interview with your future teammates (1h)</li>\n  <li>Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders</li>\n </ol> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/heetch/eb280a3e-3ef7-415e-a187-ab4ac5085810?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=StackOverflow' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>About Heetch</h4> \n<div>\n <p>Heetch is a mobility app with a simple mission: We want people to enjoy going out.<br>Every night and every day, our drivers are doing their best to make their rides unforgettable and friendly!

We are responsible for the proper handling of millions of euros across thousands of daily rides , and everyone is counting on us to deliver reliably and efficiently. We work hand in hand with the Data, Product and Operations teams to improve our product while protecting our bankrolls and maintaining compliance and cleanliness in our accounting records:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Numbers, numbers everywhere.</li>\n  <li>We help users manage their payment methods and coupons, a crucial part of the passenger on-boarding experience.</li>\n  <li>We make sure drivers get paid on time for their work by providing them with a seamless experience so they don’t have to worry about their money.</li>\n  <li>Fraudsters are like zombies, one breach, and you’ll face an army of them.</li>\n  <li>1 cent can become over 9000 cents if you don’t pay attention.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Android within Payment Team</strong></p>\n <p>As a mobile developer, your job will be to work on the interfaces, for example, to help passengers managing their payment methods/coupons or drivers understanding how much they earn on the platform. You want to make sure people can know what's going on with their money </p>\n <p><strong>Our team's values</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Transparency</strong>: We discuss everything openly within the team. Our speak up culture is strong.</li>\n  <li><strong>Remote first:</strong>&nbsp;Our team is fully distributed, and we work hard at that, but feel free to work from any of our offices in Paris, London, Brussels or Casablanca.</li>\n  <li><strong>The courage to fail:</strong>&nbsp;We celebrate the wins, but more importantly we're not afraid to fail, we always learn and go again.</li>\n  <li><strong>Team Unity</strong>: No one is left behind.</li>\n  <li><strong>Code quality:</strong>&nbsp;It's not software without tests.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Does it sound like you?</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>You have more than 5 years of experience in Android development and you still like it.</li>\n  <li>Thanks to your advanced knowledge of Rx, you can write complete use cases with flatMaps, concats, zips and are not afraid to jump from one scheduler to another.</li>\n  <li>Though you could write a book about Java, you now only want to deal with data/sealed classes, extension functions and know the difference between apply/with/also/run/let.</li>\n  <li>You know enough about Fragments, Activities, savedInstanceStates &amp; Parcelables to know what you want to work with on your next project, and what you sincerely want to see burn.</li>\n  <li>You're in love with ConstraintLayout, can make art out of Canvas and build custom views when the framework is just not enough.</li>\n  <li>You know the difference between unit &amp; automated tests, can write Rx-oriented test cases without wanting to die and know how to get everything running on a CI platform while you sleep.</li>\n  <li>You know when to use api or implementation in your gradle files and are not afraid of multi-modules projects.</li>\n  <li>If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.</li>\n  <li>If you have experience with background services, unreliable network conditions &amp; location updates, we'd love it.</li>\n  <li>If you know what kills the phone's battery and how to help mitigate the issue, we'd enjoy knowing more about it too.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features </li>\n  <li>Work in a release train cycle (we ship often )</li>\n  <li>Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of Android drivers</li>\n  <li>Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues</li>\n  <li>Have the freedom to experiment.

This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Network and GPS management: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li>\n  <li>UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li>\n  <li>One way data flow and functional pattern: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers.
