You are most likely familiar with apps such as Jira and Slack that enable you to communicate and collaborate effectively. However, what about similar apps for deskless workers? Well that's the thing, they don't really exist and so that's that we're building at Yoho.</p><p>We are creating the single place to connect, instruct and engage deskless workers to help them do their work more effectively and efficiently.

Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.</p><p>We are a socially conscious, distributed team. We give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living where you’re most comfortable and working in areas where you can help foster and grow the community that you are a part of.</p><p>We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth. As one of our first front-end developers, your decisions will have an outsized influence on the future of our product.&nbsp; You’ll take input from product, design, and customers and then you’ll collaborate with other experienced, passionate engineering team to build the frameworks and features that will support our customers now, and in the future.</p><p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborative.&nbsp;</strong>You know that your colleagues’ perspectives will make our customers successful. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together. You propose ways for us to be more engaged and successful with our customers.</li><li><strong>Customer focused</strong>. Our customers are at the forefront of your day.&nbsp; You prioritize our customers’ voice to ensure their needs are met.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ambitious, curious, and resourceful.&nbsp;</strong>You are innately curious, and you aren’t afraid to work hard. You are self driven, you take direction well but are able to be creative to find results on your own when asked. You are driven to succeed because your hard work and results make you proud.</li><li><strong>Disciplined and reliable.</strong>&nbsp; We are a distributed company and you enjoy the benefits of working distributed while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.</li><li><strong>Appreciative of honest feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</li><li><strong>Work smarter and harder.</strong>&nbsp;You often identify a problem, create a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own.&nbsp; You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful.</li></ul><p><strong>Crisp's Frontend Tech Stack&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Statically typed, modern languages.</strong>&nbsp;We use TypeScript and React for the UI, and GraphQL with Apollo to communicate with our backend.&nbsp; Knowledge of these specific technologies is not a requirement.

Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</li><li><strong>Micro-services.</strong>&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.</li><li><strong>Start-up mode.</strong>&nbsp; The team is still small, and the product is fresh.&nbsp; You’ll be able to exert a large amount of influence, and contribute to decisions that will determine the future of the product and the team.</li></ul><p>We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific background, experience or geographical location. Instead we’re looking for individuals that are capable, reliable, and hoping to grow along with us.

Now we’re setting our sights on taking the Play Store by storm. With a new frontier to conquer, we’re looking for a passionate, talented, and experienced native Android Developer eager to join the Android team to help migrate our app portfolio remotely.</p><p>A few examples of your responsibilities:</p><p>*Migrate our portfolio of world-renowned iOS apps to the most recent Android version, making them available to a whole new user base.</p><p>*Contribute to the product development of the apps you’ll work on. We’re all about taking a proactive role and ownership of your work.</p><p>*Help define the software architecture of entire apps or new features—and then develop them. The work spans a broad range, from engineering and coding features, to polishing world-class user interfaces.</p><p>*Constantly improve the quality of our products by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary, as well as adding that WOW factor to put a smile on our users’ faces.</p><p>*Stay up to speed with new technologies (particularly on Android), and test the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities.</p><p>What We Offer</p><p>*Huge impact. You’ll be working on apps used by millions of people all around the world. The quality of your work will make a decisive difference—both to the users and to Bending Spoons as a whole.</p><p>*Talented, knowledgeable colleagues. You’ll get the chance to learn from—and teach —some of the brightest and most skilled people you’ll ever meet. Your talent is going to blossom here.</p><p>*Cool tech stack. We strive to use the best, most modern tools and technologies, and when they fall short of our expectations we invent our own. It’s a geek’s paradise.</p><p>*Own products. We don’t work for clients—we only develop our own apps. Freed from client-provider politics, we can move fast and be daring.</p><p>*International reach. Our audience is truly international. Our company language is English. We’re a global force and your work will have worldwide exposure.</p><p>What We Look For</p><p>*Passion for the topic. You have a long-standing, proven passion for developing native Android apps.</p><p>*Reasoning and depth of learning. You’re structured and creative enough to solve most challenging problems independently, given the necessary knowledge. You learn new concepts and skills rapidly, and love to nerd out and go in-depth.</p><p>*Drive. You’re energetic, hard-working, and persevere through adversity until the job is done—and done well. You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.</p><p>*Curiosity and initiative. You love exploring and you’re entrepreneurial in seeking out new opportunities and testing ideas of your own accord. You seek—you don’t just wait to be told what to do.</p><p>*A knack for UX and attention to detail. You care about developing quality user experiences, and notice the details that make a difference. You get a kick out of making a UI or an animation just perfect.</p><p>*Diligence, organization. You can be entrusted with responsibilities big and small.</p><p>*Humility. You’re down to earth, eager to listen to feedback and constructive criticism, and ready to get your hands dirty with whatever the team needs to succeed.</p><p>*Proficient in English. You read, write, and speak fluently in English.</p><p>*Availability. We work 9-6 GMT+1. Our schedule is flexible, but we prefer to work together most of the time. That’s why you should live somewhere with a similar timezone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.</p><p>Commitment &amp; Contract: Full-time, permanent (tempo indeterminato).</p><p>Location: Our HQ is in downtown Milan, but you'll be working from the comfort of your home.</p><p>Compensation &amp; Benefits: Generous, top of market, and moreover can grow very rapidly and include stock options, depending on performance. You’ll receive the latest Mac, iPhone, and wireless noise-canceling Bose headset, as well as any software you might need to perform at your best.</p><p>IMPORTANT</p><p>Please notice that only applications submitted through our website will be considered.

The primary project is working on a procedure authoring tool which handles multiple actors working in parallel. We are making EVA procedures human and machine readable, and transforming procedure authors' workflow from a cumbersome process of sharing Word documents to something closer to a software development workflow. Part of this project includes getting non-programmers to use Git to maintain their procedures without them having to know much about Git, by building Git into our application and abstracting away many of its confusing details.</p><p>We are looking for interns for summer, fall, and spring, and prefer people who can support multiple semesters in a row.</p><p>Tech: NodeJS, React, Electron</p><p>Regarding REMOTE possibilities: Due to COVID-19 it _may_ be possible to support remote hires. This is not something we've done for interns in the past, but we're pushing for it since everyone is remote now anyway. I cannot guarantee it will happen, but if you're interested in this position but can only support remotely, I recommend applying.</p><p>How to apply: NASA interns apply through a generic process, so your application will be made available to a wide range of employers. Also, like any good bureaucracy, there is more than one process for application. Here are two of them:</p><p>Application process 1: Contact Linda Drobnich at Linda.Drobnich AT sjcd DOT edu.</p><p>Application process 2: Create an account at intern.nasa.gov and search for &quot;EVA Informatics / HHP Model - 17500&quot;. The specifics for this posting are out of date, and will soon be updated to match what I wrote above.</p><p>I recommend applying to both application processes. In either case, let me know you applied so I can look for you (either as a comment here or emailing me at &lt;my-hn-username&gt; at gmail dot com).</p><p>[0] ISS: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station</a></p><p>[1] EVA: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity</a></p>",
