We are responsible for the proper handling of millions of euros across thousands of daily rides , and everyone is counting on us to deliver reliably and efficiently. We work hand in hand with the Data, Product and Operations teams to improve our product while protecting our bankrolls and maintaining compliance and cleanliness in our accounting records:</p><ul><li>Numbers, numbers everywhere.</li><li>We help users manage their payment methods and coupons, a crucial part of the passenger on-boarding experience.</li><li>We make sure drivers get paid on time for their work by providing them with a seamless experience so they don’t have to worry about their money.</li><li>Fraudsters are like zombies, one breach, and you’ll face an army of them.</li><li>1 cent can become over 9000 cents if you don’t pay attention.</li></ul><p><strong>Android within Payment Team</strong></p><p>As a mobile developer, your job will be to work on the interfaces, for example, to help passengers managing their payment methods/coupons or drivers understanding how much they earn on the platform. You want to make sure people can know what's going on with their money </p><p><strong>Our team's values</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Transparency</strong>: We discuss everything openly within the team. Our speak up culture is strong.</li><li><strong>Remote first:</strong>&nbsp;Our team is fully distributed, and we work hard at that, but feel free to work from any of our offices in Paris, London, Brussels or Casablanca.</li><li><strong>The courage to fail:</strong>&nbsp;We celebrate the wins, but more importantly we're not afraid to fail, we always learn and go again.</li><li><strong>Team Unity</strong>: No one is left behind.</li><li><strong>Code quality:</strong>&nbsp;It's not software without tests.</li></ul><p><strong>Does it sound like you?</strong></p><ul><li>You have more than 5 years of experience in Android development and you still like it.</li><li>Thanks to your advanced knowledge of Rx, you can write complete use cases with flatMaps, concats, zips and are not afraid to jump from one scheduler to another.</li><li>Though you could write a book about Java, you now only want to deal with data/sealed classes, extension functions and know the difference between apply/with/also/run/let.</li><li>You know enough about Fragments, Activities, savedInstanceStates &amp; Parcelables to know what you want to work with on your next project, and what you sincerely want to see burn.</li><li>You're in love with ConstraintLayout, can make art out of Canvas and build custom views when the framework is just not enough.</li><li>You know the difference between unit &amp; automated tests, can write Rx-oriented test cases without wanting to die and know how to get everything running on a CI platform while you sleep.</li><li>You know when to use api or implementation in your gradle files and are not afraid of multi-modules projects.</li><li>If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.</li><li>If you have experience with background services, unreliable network conditions &amp; location updates, we'd love it.</li><li>If you know what kills the phone's battery and how to help mitigate the issue, we'd enjoy knowing more about it too.</li></ul><p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p><ul><li>Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features </li><li>Work in a release train cycle (we ship often )</li><li>Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of Android drivers</li><li>Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues</li><li>Have the freedom to experiment.

This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li>Network and GPS management: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li><li>UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li><li>One way data flow and functional pattern: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>What's next?</strong></p><p>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps:</p><ol><li>Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30)</li><li>Take home assignment (~5 days deadline)</li><li>Interview with your future teammates (1h)</li><li>Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders</li></ol>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/heetch/808d2619-097d-4497-9ada-ec1ae33dfb35?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=StackOverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Heetch</h4>            <div><p>Heetch is a mobility app with a simple mission: We want people to enjoy going out.<br>Every night and every day, our drivers are doing their best to make their rides unforgettable and friendly!

I’ve worked everything from CRDT’s to OpenGL shaders to even sewing sensors into a vest. Lots of opportunities to learn including graduate education and self-directed training. CTI hosted an internal hackathon over the summer where all of the engineers got together at a game house and learned more about each other while trying to integrate SDR's with new wearables.

The Yoto ecosystem revolves around a curated library of stories, music, activities, sound effects, podcasts and radio. Children listen to the content on Yoto Player, a safely connected speaker that is controlled using physical cards with NFC technology. Additionally the Yoto App allows parents to retain a level of control, enabling volume control, remote play and more.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We launched our first hardware product, Yoto Player, on <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yoto/yoto-a-clever-speaker-for-kids/'>Kickstarter</a> in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and receiving a Red Dot Design award in the process. The product shipped for Christmas 2018 to a great customer reaction.

Instead of smart contracts we created building blocks, making applications, tokens and coins as easy to deploy as possible. It’s fast, it works and our test net is already live.</p><p>Radix has built up a global following 43,000 interested community members, companies and developers from around the world. As well as raising money from some of the top European VCs and Funds.</p><p>What problems are we solving?</p><p>Currently, money is hyper-local, it exists in small pools in each country with specialised service and tech providers specific to the jurisdiction. Radix changes that. We believe businesses should create money without borders. Our ledger provides API toolkits to developers that includes the regulatory wrappers, removing much of the need for developers and companies to worry about regulatory compliance, client money rules and jurisdictional red tape.&nbsp;We can do that because Radix is a next-generation decentralised ledger technology.</p><p>We believe this is what technology should look like and we are looking for talent to help us deliver on our promise.</p><p>Learn more about us</p><p>Radix Technology:&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FdnOO2nItiss' rel='nofollow'>https://youtu.be/dnOO2nItiss</a></p><p>Radix Mission:&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FHw90aMyvLbM' rel='nofollow'>https://youtu.be/Hw90aMyvLbM</a></p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>International Company Events</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great Team</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.</p><p>We are a remote-first company which means we give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living and working wherever you are most comfortable. We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth.</p><p>As a member of the first few engineering teams at Crisp you have will have the unique opportunity to take products from concept to production as we build towards our goal of becoming the global technology platform for the food industry. You will work closely with the co-founder team and be part of not just defining and implementing our technology and product strategy, but also the way we work together as we scale our company.</p><p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborative.</strong>&nbsp;You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together.</li><li><strong>Customer focused.</strong>&nbsp;User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if the customers don't enjoy using it.</li><li><strong>Disciplined and reliable.</strong>&nbsp;We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.</li><li><strong>Appreciative of honest feedback.</strong>&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</li><li><strong>Work smarter and harder.</strong>&nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.</li><li><strong>Analytical and practical mind.</strong>&nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.</li></ul><p><strong>Crisp’s tech stack</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Statically typed, modern languages.</strong>&nbsp;We use TypeScript and Kotlin, but knowledge of them is not a requirement and we’re happy to help you come up to speed.</li><li><strong>Continuous deployment.</strong>&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</li><li><strong>JVM based back-end.</strong>&nbsp;The JVM has a robust, rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that we’re leveraging to help us focus on building solutions, not tool-chains.</li><li><strong>Cloud first.</strong>&nbsp;As a services offering in the 21st century, the cloud isn’t the future, it’s the present. We’re fully invested in using the features offered by our cloud provider in order to minimize technical debt and maximize productivity.</li><li><strong>Micro-services.</strong>&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.</li></ul><p>We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific background, experience or geographical location. Instead we’re looking for individuals that are capable, reliable, and hoping to grow along with us. Do you have strengths you can share?
