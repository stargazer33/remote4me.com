The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:<br><br>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.<br><br>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.<br><br>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.<br><br>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.<p>See more jobs at <span>Wallethub</span></p></div></div>",

If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. </p><p>FIRM REQUIREMENTS:<br>•  64 bit Mac / Macbook / Hackintosh core i7 preferred<br>•  Must write clean, re-usable code (we will test you)<br>•  3 months X 20 hours/week commitment<br>•  Our internships are UNPAID. No salary, no stipend, etc. <br>•  Desire to work in a startup environment, able to self-manage and work remotely* <br>•  Must have built at least two Android and/or iOS apps with Flutter<br>•  Git experience<br>* Remotely = you would work as we all do, from home or where we live.</p><p>Beneficial but not required:<br>•  Fluency with Java<br>•  Basic understanding of Android extensions/custom keyboards<br>•  TDD/Testing frameworks awareness (JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, etc.)</p><p>We greatly limit the number of interns we work with in each division. Applications are now being taken for start dates 1~3 months from now.</p><p>Hashtags, yay!</p><p>No, that's not what we do. </p><p>So, what DO we do? <br>Data-driven, machine learning-infused social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>• Total social media optimization - avoid paying for ads by intelligently automating everything shared to social with images, GIFs, emojis, influencer-tagging. Come up in social search, get curated and republished, and make a visual impact as well.<br>•  Hashtags that are recommended based on current engagement and outcomes, rather than whether they are &quot;trending&quot; (trending = many accounts sending posts with a hashtag; it says nothing about positive outcomes).<br> <br>What you will experience:<br>•  Building both Android and iOS applications with Flutter<br>•  Learn from mentors and peer feedback in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>•  Brainstorm and implement app features<br>•  Build the fully functional app from start to finish<br>•  Exposure to Rest APIs<br>•  We make you part of the process, so you can earn how to bootstrap your own startup, in case you want to do that<br>•  We ship fast - and with over 250,000 registrations, when put your latest feature into production, your work will be seen and become part of the workflow for thousands of business people.<br> <br>* As a self-funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends who have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time. Should you be selected for a first interview, please do ask what our interns go on to do, either as RiteKit salaried staff or after RiteKit. We'll give you ways to research this.</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers.</p></div>",

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:<br><br>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.<br><br>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.<br><br>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.<br><br>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.<br><br>Note:&nbsp;This position does not have a location requirement and can be performed either remotely (including from outside the U.S.) or from WalletHub’s offices in downtown Washington DC. If you're intending to work from outside the US please&nbsp;be aware this position entails working at least 50 hour per week and requires an overlap with EST business hours.<p>See more jobs at <span>Wallethub</span></p></div></div>",

So far our extraction capabilities include automated product and article extraction from single pages, and we plan to expand it to support whole-domain, and also support more page types like jobs and news. The service is still in early stages of development, serving its first customers.Our platform has several components communicating via Apache Kafka. Most components are written in Python, with a few components implemented with Scala and Kafka Streams. The current priorities are improving reliability and scalability of the system, integrating with other Scrapinghub services, and adding new features like auto-scaling.

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:<br><br>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.<br><br>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.<br><br>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.<br><br>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.<br><br>Note:&nbsp;This position does not have a location requirement and can be performed either remotely (including from outside the US) or from WalletHub’s offices in downtown Washington DC. If you're intending to work from outside the US please&nbsp;be aware this position entails working at least 50 hour per week and requires an overlap with EST business hours.<p>See more jobs at <span>Wallethub</span></p></div></div>",

The project is based at the University of Oslo where we operate as an independent software development organisation. As a software engineer you will be an employee of the University of Oslo, with the government pension plan and benefits which&nbsp;come with it.</p><p>With us you get a chance to work on stuff which really matters: Improving the health and well-being of people in developing countries through access and use of information. Our platform is used in more than 60 countries worldwide and has the scale and adoption which will allow you to make an impact globally.</p><p>We give you a lot of flexibility and freedom and there is no micro-management or strict hierarchies. At&nbsp;DHIS 2 we believe you will do your best work if you fully understand the context which the system operates in. As a result you are&nbsp;encouraged to engage directly with our projects, take part in the design process and get feedback from users in the field.

Our teams are now working on the build and release of the marque Disney SVOD platform that will be launching in 2019, and as a result, we have a number of key roles to hire in 2018.</p><p>Our New York team moved into the new BAMTECH engineering offices on W 17th Street at the start of this year, and with some fantastic new additions, we currently have 15 people on that team (with the bulk working on the BAMTECH Ad-Engine project). There is, however, still plenty of room for new team members to join us, and we’d love to add more Mid and Senior Scala Engineers to the team throughout the year. We want to talk with talented engineers who are either practising functional programming or interested in being functional (but some self-exploration with Haskell, Lisp, Clojure, or F# is necessary).</p><p><strong>So what does being a Scala Engineer at BAMTECH entail?</strong></p><p>You will have the opportunity to stay at the forefront of technology and apply a principled approach to software engineering, as well as having the opportunity to work on a wide range of interesting projects with our partners using Scala, Akka, Kafka, Kinesis and Dynamo. We aim to build software that is distributed, reactive and scalable.</p><p>You will also have solid communication skills and will be able to interpret the intricacies of the business domain, whilst also offering technical support to Tech Leads &amp; the Senior Team. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>What will you do:</strong></p><ul><li>Solve complex problems using the most appropriate polyglot architecture.</li><li>Be involved in a lively and challenging environment.</li><li>Use the latest technologies and tools on modern hardware at scale.</li><li>Work on challenging and varied business domains.</li><li>Develop your technical understanding to support and build your career.</li></ul><p><strong>What we’d like to see:</strong></p><ul><li>Demonstrable working experience with the Lightbend Reactive Platform, particularly Scala, Akka &amp; Play.</li><li>Experience creating scalable and reactive web applications with modern frameworks such as: Play, ScalaJS, AngularJS, ReactJS.</li><li>Knowledge of applying object-oriented and functional programming styles to real-world software engineering problems.</li><li>Demonstrable understanding of high-quality coding and testing practices.</li><li>A strong understanding of continuous integration and continuous delivery practices.</li><li>An appetite to learn new technologies and a drive for continual improvement.</li><li>A keen interest in technology and self-improvement. &nbsp;Examples include having an active Github account or completion of relevant Coursera courses.</li><li>Contributions to the technical community, either through blogs, internal workshops, meetups or conferences.</li></ul><p><strong>What can you expect from BAMTECH?</strong></p><p>You can expect to join a engaging business that owes a lot of its success to the communities it contributes to. We are avid ambassadors of the technologies we use and loyal contributors to the communities we support. We are a diverse team that has been supporting Scala, DevOps and Agile communities for over 5 years with blogs, meetups, user groups and conferences, as well as contributing and maintaining OSS. If you want a role where you have the freedom to explore new technologies, as well as the encouragement to develop your own ability, then BAMTECH can offer that.</p><p>If you’re interested in joining a growing startup that will be making a significant impact in the way consumers engage with media over the foreseeable future, apply here.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/143413?reset=False&amp;ra=M5Y4nJd3ewM&amp;oqs=a%3DM5Y4nJd3ewM' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Gym Membership</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Working Hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Latest hardware</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great coffee!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work on greenfield projects</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Bleeding edge technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Attend conferences</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Open Source Contributors</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Relocation &amp; Visa Support</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

You take the amorphous sets of needs and use cases and distill these into written designs and specifications. You demonstrate a fastidious attention to detail, knowledge of your programming tools, and the ability to regularly produce working, correct code.</p><p>Pyrofex hires engineers at all levels of experience—from current students to engineers with decades of experience. After all, one of our founders has a Ph.D., and the other dropped out of college, twice! The path we've taken to get this far is unique and we suspect the same will be true of our best employees.</p><p>We are most interested in hiring programmers with knowledge of functional programming, a background in computer science, and can program in Scala. However, if you think this job is for you, we'll take a look.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>Our Software Engineers will help us deliver various products and platforms, which are written in Scala, C/C++, Python, Rust, and JavaScript. The engineers on this team will design, implement, test, deploy, and manage a large-scale global software system using Linux and the JVM. Pyrofex builds cryptocurrency systems and large-scale distributed and decentralized applications.</p><p>Five years ago, we thought things like SRE and DevOps would make it clear what &quot;deploy and manage&quot; meant for the future, but now we know we were wrong. The future is changing too fast and our job is to keep up. That said, from time to time, we all have to get out of bed at 2AM to deal with something broken.</p><p>If this sounds good to you, then e-mail us at <strong><a href='mailto:jobs@pyrofex.net' rel='nofollow'>jobs@pyrofex.net</a></strong> with the subject line, “SIGN ME UP!” and your resume or linkedin profile. We would also enjoy a cover letter telling us about your work ethic and your favorite project. If you can send us examples of your code, that would be most excellent.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/173627?reset=False&amp;ra=WecHwmYEr1m&amp;oqs=a%3DWecHwmYEr1m' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>New Technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with a highly intelligent and productive team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full Health benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great communication amongst the team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Build from the ground up and make progress!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Work Available</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:<br><br>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.<br><br>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.<br><br>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.<br><br>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.<br><br>Note:&nbsp;This position does not have a location requirement and can be performed either remotely (including from outside the US) or from WalletHub’s offices in downtown Washington DC. If you're intending to work from outside the US please&nbsp;be aware this position entails working at least 50 hour per week and requires an overlap with EST business hours.<p>See more jobs at <span>Wallethub</span></p></div></div>",

The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:<br><br>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.<br><br>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.<br><br>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.<br><br>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.<br><br>Note:&nbsp;This position does not have a location requirement and can be performed either remotely (including from outside the US) or from WalletHub’s offices in downtown Washington DC.

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:<br><br>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.<br><br>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.<br><br>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.<br><br>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.<br><br>Note:&nbsp;This position does not have a location requirement and can be performed either remotely (including from outside the US) or from WalletHub’s offices in downtown Washington D.C. If you're intending to work from outside the US please&nbsp;be aware this position entails working at least 50 hour per week and requires an overlap with EST business hours.<p>See more jobs at <span>Wallethub</span></p></div></div>",

The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:<br><br>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.<br><br>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.<br><br>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.<br><br>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.<br><br>How to Apply<br><br>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

We build several platforms for web and mobile, for several organisations ranging from start-ups to well known brands.</p><h4>About the role</h4><p>You might be wanting to step up from a more junior role, or just fancy a change. You might be working in a larger company and… well, be a little bored? Here you won’t be bored; it’s a fast paced and varied environment, where you’ll be trying new technologies and applying them to solve the interesting challenges our clients present.</p><p>You’ll know your craft inside out, but we’ll support your never ending quest to autonomously learn new skills. We like trying new things out in our studio projects. We’re a small company so you’ll have a real say in how we operate. It’s time for you to step up!</p><p>Oh… and we ALL make the tea…</p><h4>Technically ticking the boxes</h4><p><b>You’ll need to be nailing these:</b></p><ul><li>Javascript including ES6 &amp; Node. We use React.js &amp; React Native, and you’ll need to hit the ground running with this. But if your experience is in Angular or VUE.js then that’s good with us – it’s equally valid!</li><li>HTML5 and CSS</li><li>Pre-compilers like SASS, LESS, and bundlers like Grunt, Gulp &amp; Webpack</li><li>GIT</li></ul><p><b>These will massively help your application</b>:</p><ul><li>Working knowledge of other server side &amp; database technologies, such as JAVA (Spring MVC / Spring Boot). We’ve traditionally been a PHP/JAVA/MySQL house – but you can have experience in others.</li><li>Experience in using API based backend services such as Google Firebase, or NoSQL architecture like MongoDB.</li><li>Photoshop/Illustrator/Sketch – we don’t expect you to be an experienced UI designer but you’ll need to appreciate the importance of good design and UI.</li><li>CMS Builds. As a company we offer so much more but we do still do our fair share of WordPress/Contentful builds &amp; similar. A ‘need to know’ around a CMS of your choice is useful.</li></ul><h4>Benefits</h4><p>We understand that different people like different things so we don’t have an official ‘rewards package’… if you want something… ask!</p><p>That said, we offer:<br></p><ul><li>25 days holiday (plus the normal 8 days bank holiday)</li><li>Flexible working hours (we’re a task based organisation)</li></ul><ul></ul><p><b>So - if you think you can step up to the plate and become Spork's new prong, then get in touch! Send through your CVs, portfolios, repository details or whatever you have to jobs@wearespork.net.</b></p>",
