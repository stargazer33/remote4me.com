You will join a team responsible for the ultra-low-latency AlphaFlash economic data feed. The job involves far more than just basic server-side Java programming – you’ll build web applications, write web scrapers, and manage hundreds of processes running on multiple cloud providers. We look for developers who are generalists and who like picking up new skills. You may have to work with low-level network protocols at one point, and then later work with natural language processing. We don’t expect you to know everything, but we do expect you to be able to learn new technologies and techniques.The development team is small, with 2 very experienced and highly skilled developers, and we are looking for a 3rd developer. The company is an accredited news agency with good upper management. Everybody focuses on success and gets along well. Although the pace is quick, we don’t want burnout, so we keep sane working hours and respect your time off.We have less than 100 people worldwide, most of them reporters, but have competed successfully for decades against behemoths like Bloomberg and Dow Jones. We are good at what we do, and we can respond to customer needs with agility that the big boys can’t match.The technical team (developers and IT staff) is spread around the United States, and we are looking for a developer that can keep typical work hours on US eastern or central time to facilitate communication with the other team members. We have offices in Chicago, New York City and Washington, D.C. where you can work, but we also have team members that work remotely.We will consider candidates of all skill levels. You need to have a very solid core Java knowledge. Other experience, such as Sprint Boot, Angular and network protocols, is definitely nice to have, but the attitude you bring to the job is ultimately the most important criteria. We are looking for flexibility, curiosity, attention to detail, and ability to solve sometimes-difficult problems. Your willingness and ability to learn new technologies is important.You can work either in or out of the United States. If you are in the United States, we are only considering candidates who can work in the US without requiring visa sponsorship. If you are outside the United States, you have to be in North or South America (to minimize the spread across time zones), and your English must be excellent.Our online application does ask a lot of questions about technologies. We don’t expect you to know them all; your answers just help us to understand what you do know so we won’t ask you questions about topics you haven’t learned yet.RequirementsMust have Excellent Core Java skills Comfort working in a Linux environment Be qualified to work in the United States without a visa Nice to have Experience with Groovy or some other dynamic language (Ruby, JavaScript) Experience with multi-tier web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks, including relational database modeling, creating web services and using an ORM Knowledge of data structures and algorithms Network transport and high-level messaging, such as TCP/UDP and JMS Experience with gradle (preferred) or Maven Experience with unit testing and continuous integration (e.g. JUnit, Spock, JMock) Good architecture and design skills Ability to manage projects from inception to deployment Functional programming in Java or Scala C# and Windows programming Familiarity with Jenkins and Artifactory Configuration management experience (Puppet or equivalent) DevOps experience Benefits Market News offers a competitive compensation and benefits package, including health insurance, paid time off, and a 401(k) plan.

Instead of smart contracts we created building blocks, making applications, tokens and coins as easy to deploy as possible. It’s fast, it works and our test net is already live.</p><p>Radix has built up a global following 43,000 interested community members, companies and developers from around the world. As well as raising money from some of the top European VCs and Funds.</p><p>What problems are we solving?</p><p>Currently, money is hyper-local, it exists in small pools in each country with specialised service and tech providers specific to the jurisdiction. Radix changes that. We believe businesses should create money without borders. Our ledger provides API toolkits to developers that includes the regulatory wrappers, removing much of the need for developers and companies to worry about regulatory compliance, client money rules and jurisdictional red tape.&nbsp;We can do that because Radix is a next-generation decentralised ledger technology.</p><p>We believe this is what technology should look like and we are looking for talent to help us deliver on our promise.</p><p>Learn more about us</p><p>Radix Technology:&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FdnOO2nItiss' rel='nofollow'>https://youtu.be/dnOO2nItiss</a></p><p>Radix Mission:&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FHw90aMyvLbM' rel='nofollow'>https://youtu.be/Hw90aMyvLbM</a></p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>International Company Events</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great Team</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.</p><p>We are a remote-first company which means we give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living and working wherever you are most comfortable. We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth.</p><p>As a member of the first few engineering teams at Crisp you have will have the unique opportunity to take products from concept to production as we build towards our goal of becoming the global technology platform for the food industry. You will work closely with the co-founder team and be part of not just defining and implementing our technology and product strategy, but also the way we work together as we scale our company.</p><p><strong>Signs of a great candidate</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborative.</strong>&nbsp;You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together.</li><li><strong>Customer focused.</strong>&nbsp;User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if the customers don't enjoy using it.</li><li><strong>Disciplined and reliable.</strong>&nbsp;We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.</li><li><strong>Appreciative of honest feedback.</strong>&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.</li><li><strong>Work smarter and harder.</strong>&nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.</li><li><strong>Analytical and practical mind.</strong>&nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.</li></ul><p><strong>Crisp’s tech stack</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Statically typed, modern languages.</strong>&nbsp;We use TypeScript and Kotlin, but knowledge of them is not a requirement and we’re happy to help you come up to speed.</li><li><strong>Continuous deployment.</strong>&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.</li><li><strong>JVM based back-end.</strong>&nbsp;The JVM has a robust, rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that we’re leveraging to help us focus on building solutions, not tool-chains.</li><li><strong>Cloud first.</strong>&nbsp;As a services offering in the 21st century, the cloud isn’t the future, it’s the present. We’re fully invested in using the features offered by our cloud provider in order to minimize technical debt and maximize productivity.</li><li><strong>Micro-services.</strong>&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.</li></ul><p>We are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products.

Under new leadership for 2019, the company is undergoing a transformation, moving from their successful history as one of the leading players in the Enterprise Content Management space, to becoming the business automation and development platform of choice for some of the largest companies across the world.<br><br>Their software is used by household names across the finance, insurance and healthcare industries as well by governments in the US, UK and France. Whether it's Nasa scientists collaborating on research material for the Mars Rover, Sales Engineers at Cisco supporting their customers or Nurses at Liverpool Women's Hospital, the software they develop makes a real difference to those that use it.<br><br>They're innovating and solving some of the hardest technical problems for these customers. They're building secure, compliant content systems which need to meet web-scale search requirements, deployable into modern public cloud vendors such as AWS and Azure. They've created the first, modern, Cloud-Native business automation engine, building out scalable solutions using Docker and Kubernetes. Earlier this year they launched their first move into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning.<br><br>And what's more, they do all of this in the open, as an Enterprise Open-Source company. They work with their community on their products and they even host their own developer conference. They most recent DevCon took place in January this year, where over 400 people attended from their community, customers, and partners. Of course, if you join them, you get the chance to be there. <br><br>Over the coming year, they'll be bringing all of this technology to the cloud. This project is just getting started and by joining now you'll be part of their our journey to PaaS.<br><br>They work in Agile development teams, sprinkled with XP practices. They value good quality code, a preference for TDD and test automation, and an attitude for getting stuff done.

Under new leadership for 2019, the company is undergoing a transformation, moving from their successful history as one of the leading players in the Enterprise Content Management space, to becoming the business automation and development platform of choice for some of the largest companies across the world.<br><br>Their software is used by household names across the finance, insurance and healthcare industries as well by governments in the US, UK and France. Whether it's Nasa scientists collaborating on research material for the Mars Rover, Sales Engineers at Cisco supporting their customers or Nurses at Liverpool Women's Hospital, the software they develop makes a real difference to those that use it.<br><br>They're innovating and solving some of the hardest technical problems for these customers. They're building secure, compliant content systems which need to meet web-scale search requirements, deployable into modern public cloud vendors such as AWS and Azure. They've created the first, modern, Cloud-Native business automation engine, building out scalable solutions using Docker and Kubernetes. Earlier this year they launched their first move into the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning.<br><br>And what's more, they do all of this in the open, as an Enterprise Open-Source company. They work with their community on their products and they even host their own developer conference. They most recent DevCon took place in January this year, where over 400 people attended from their community, customers, and partners. Of course, if you join them, you get the chance to be there. <br><br>Over the coming year, they'll be bringing all of this technology to the cloud. This project is just getting started and by joining now you'll be part of their our journey to PaaS.<br><br>They work in Agile development teams, sprinkled with XP practices. They value good quality code, a preference for TDD and test automation, and an attitude for getting stuff done. Most of their products are built using Java, where they have a strong preference for Spring and Spring-Boot. On the front-end side, it's JavaScript and Angular. they're AWS-first, but not AWS only, meaning that Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, CloudFormation, and Terraform are all technologies that they use.<br><br>Their teams are distributed, with engineering hubs in London and Maidenhead in the UK, and one also in Romania.

By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.\\n\\nWe are a remote-first company which means we give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living and working wherever you are most comfortable. We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth.\\n\\nAs a member of the first product engineering team at Crisp you have will have a unique opportunity to turn previously scattered and inconsistently structured data into directly actionable food industry insights to reduce waste, increase freshness and much more.\\n\\nYou have a proven track record of reading data and making solid conclusions. You know both the art&nbsp;and&nbsp;science of analytics - not only do you know how to find answers in the data, you also know which questions should be asked in the first place and what data can help us further bolster our conclusions.&nbsp;You love engaging with customers, learning about their challenges and then diving into the data to see how to solve them!\\n\\nSigns of a great candidate\\n\\n\\n* Collaborative.&nbsp;You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together.\\n\\n* Customer focused.&nbsp;User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if customers don't enjoy using it.\\n\\n* Disciplined and reliable.&nbsp;We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.\\n\\n* Appreciative of honest feedback.&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.\\n\\n* Work smarter and harder.&nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.\\n\\n* Analytical and practical mind.&nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCrisp’s tech stack\\n\\n\\n* Statically typed, modern languages.&nbsp;We use TypeScript and Kotlin, but knowledge of them is not a requirement and we’re happy to help you come up to speed.\\n\\n* Continuous deployment.&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.\\n\\n* JVM based back-end.&nbsp;The JVM has a robust, rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that we’re leveraging to help us focus on building solutions, not tool-chains.\\n\\n* Cloud first.&nbsp;As a services offering in the 21st century, the cloud isn’t the future, it’s the present. We’re fully invested in using the features offered by our cloud provider in order to minimize technical debt and maximize productivity.\\n\\n* Micro-services.&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific background, experience or geographical location. Instead we’re looking for individuals that are capable, reliable, and hoping to grow along with us. Do you have strengths you can share? If so, we’d love to hear from you!  </div> </div>",

By bringing together bright, motivated creators, wherever they live and work, we are leveraging humanity’s diversity of experience and background in order to understand the challenges facing our food supply, and solve them together. Come join us, and help build the type of business you’d like to be a part of.\\n\\nWe are a remote-first company which means we give you the opportunity to solve challenges in the global food industry while living and working wherever you are most comfortable. We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of empowerment, personal impact and career growth.\\n\\nAs a member of the first few engineering teams at Crisp you have will have the unique opportunity to take products from concept to production as we build towards our goal of becoming the global technology platform for the food industry. You will work closely with the co-founder team and be part of not just defining and implementing our technology and product strategy, but also the way we work together as we scale our company.\\n\\nSigns of a great candidate\\n\\n\\n* Collaborative.&nbsp;You know that your team members’ perspectives will make your solutions better. Similarly, you use your strengths to help us grow together.\\n\\n* Customer focused.&nbsp;User experience trumps everything. You understand that a product will have little value if the customers don't enjoy using it.\\n\\n* Disciplined and reliable.&nbsp;We are a remote company and you enjoy the benefits of working remotely while consistently delivering what you have committed to. When you hit a snag, you communicate and reset expectations early.\\n\\n* Appreciative of honest feedback.&nbsp;You know that the best way to learn and grow is through constructive feedback delivered kindly, but without unnecessary ambiguity. You view feedback given to you as an opportunity to get better and strive to do the same for others.\\n\\n* Work smarter and harder.&nbsp;You often identify a problem, design a solution and bring it to a state of completion - with others, or even on your own. You are fluent with your toolchain and can deliver well-designed, well-tested production-ready features quickly. You find ways of eliminating or automating stuff that is uninteresting or wasteful, rather than complaining about them.\\n\\n* Analytical and practical mind.&nbsp;You strive for simple, precise solutions to complex problems. Complex solutions are only acceptable when absolutely needed. You strive for correct solutions, but know what actually matters and when to make compromises. You know when to ship and when to optimize.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCrisp’s tech stack\\n\\n\\n* Statically typed, modern languages.&nbsp;We use TypeScript and Kotlin, but knowledge of them is not a requirement and we’re happy to help you come up to speed.\\n\\n* Continuous deployment.&nbsp;Code is never far from being deployed to production, because if it’s not in production, it’s not solving problems in the real world. Our branch time spans are short, and features under development are hidden behind feature flags.\\n\\n* JVM based back-end.&nbsp;The JVM has a robust, rich ecosystem of libraries and tools that we’re leveraging to help us focus on building solutions, not tool-chains.\\n\\n* Cloud first.&nbsp;As a services offering in the 21st century, the cloud isn’t the future, it’s the present. We’re fully invested in using the features offered by our cloud provider in order to minimize technical debt and maximize productivity.\\n\\n* Micro-services.&nbsp;Not for the sake of the buzz, but when they make sense. By adopting a modern, thoughtful services architecture we’re able to scale organizationally, reduce technical debt, and maintain a high, sustained velocity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are building a team of developers with a breadth of combined experiences so that we can collaboratively build great products. There are no hard requirements on specific background, experience or geographical location. Instead we’re looking for individuals that are capable, reliable, and hoping to grow along with us. Do you have strengths you can share? If so, we’d love to hear from you!  </div> </div>",

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We’re pragmatic crafters who believe in smart and focused development, building clients’ products just as we do our own: investing heavily in design, iterating rapidly to validate and falsify ideas, and pursuing perfection in every interaction. We learned a lot of interesting things along the way about the right way to ship software, and we're now bringing our incredible software product experience to larger companies like <strong>Verizon, Google, Intel, Twitter, Sony, L'Oréal</strong>— and we do this all with a fully distributed team.<br><br></div><div>We believe that well-made software can change the world, no matter how small or simple a product might be. We also believe that poorly-made software —badly-designed, badly-developed, or badly-supported— is a preventable tragedy.<br><br></div><div>Mokriya’s mission is to make great software: for ourselves, for our clients and most importantly for our users.<br><br></div><div><strong>About You<br></strong><br></div><div>You love to build.
