improves the discussion of news articles by allowing users to tag incorrect facts, bad reasoning or uncivil behavior. It is a place where people can comment on news in depth, and share their opinions through social media. </p><p>When multiple people have &quot;fisked&quot; the same article, the system produces a page which highlights the flaws or qualities in the text, as determined by a statistical test of significance of the (human-input) tags. In short, it has the potential to fact-check all online news/content in real time.</p><p>Additionally, by allowing users to fisk each other's comments, we create a granular, peer-reviewed discussion of the topic which is much more useful - and useable -  for interested readers. This allows us to build in a Troll Filter which will enable readers to weed out bad-faith commentary, while preserving Fiskkit's &quot;No Censorship&quot; principle. </p><p>It's the future of online engagement.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Francisco</span>, <span>United States</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>$21K Seed in 2014</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Digital Media</span>, <span>News</span>, <span>Blogging Platforms</span>, <span>Writers</span></div><div><div></div><a href='http://twitter.com/fiskkit' rel='nofollow'>@fiskkit</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://fiskkit.com' rel='nofollow'>fiskkit.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/645/391645-448935d3377d1e925a3c4868e17c8b5d97850972.jpg?1409434617' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/647/391647-1e2834f49606b3cc6be857b62670a3939201a96a.jpg?1409434718' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/653/391653-4abd9dfabc6ac13a568b82e72b51dd09de011e30.png?1409439518' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/654/391654-3db0f14b8aa81d645cbb9119181aa85131aa4726.png?1409439529' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/658/391658-79c6f923d2c1e0cbb66632c67a0449fed8efaa64.jpg?1409441817' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/386434-fiskkit?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;Fiskkit&quot;

We're self-funded and doing this for 6.5 years. We believe in what we do, and are committed to the team and our value proposition. We give back plenty but are not able to compensate interns financially.</p><p>RiteKit interns share insights on the team, experience, career boosts: <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a></p><p>At our core:<br>&quot;Enhance&quot;: this feature is the gem at the center the RiteBoost automation dashboard and RiteForge, the social publishing SaaS. </p><p>The customer's customized &quot;Enhance&quot; does any/all of the following in one click: <br>• semantically determines topics of a post and auto-hashtags them for current and historical engagement <br>• Auto-emojify<br>• converts URLs in social posts to a custom tiny URL with a baked-in advertisement<br>• if the words in your post are not good as hashtags, Enhance adds up to two at the end of the post<br>• extracts a good image from images embedded in the body of a page, if the page's URL is in your post<br>• optional: highlight text or add &quot;quotes&quot; around text before Enhancing - this makes an image from the text, with a customer-branded image background.<br>• author attribution<br>• even more options are available</p><p>We serve enterprise customers, too: <a href='https://ritekit.com/api-demo' rel='nofollow'>https://ritekit.com/api-demo</a></p><p>We're growing fast, gaining traction, we're going big, and all the while, our culture continues to improve. No one works &quot;for&quot; RiteKit; we listen, mentor, involve people in the decision making. We work &quot;with&quot; people not above them. Please feel welcome to ask any of us to explain what the difference means to to them. See Hashtag Academy in Medium to see their interviews and read what they say about our impact on careers.</p><p>What do our interns do after us? Search RiteTag in LinkedIn, then do an advanced  search to see the people. Our interns either join the team or have moved on to PopSugar, Google, Snapchat and so on.</p><p>Our four SaaS products in 60 seconds: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to RiteKit</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to RiteKit</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>All RiteKit internships are unpaid. If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. </p><p>FIRM REQUIREMENTS:<br>•  64 bit Mac / Macbook / Hackintosh core i7 preferred<br>•  Must write clean, re-usable code (we will test you)<br>•  3 months X 20 hours/week commitment<br>•  Our internships are UNPAID. No salary, no stipend, etc. <br>•  Desire to work in a startup environment, able to self-manage and work remotely* <br>•  Must have built at least two Android and/or iOS apps with Flutter<br>•  Git experience<br>* Remotely = you would work as we all do, from home or where we live.</p><p>Beneficial but not required:<br>•  Fluency with Java<br>•  Basic understanding of Android extensions/custom keyboards<br>•  TDD/Testing frameworks awareness (JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, etc.)</p><p>We greatly limit the number of interns we work with in each division. Applications are now being taken for start dates 1~3 months from now.</p><p>Hashtags, yay!</p><p>No, that's not what we do. </p><p>So, what DO we do? <br>Data-driven, machine learning-infused social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>• Total social media optimization - avoid paying for ads by intelligently automating everything shared to social with images, GIFs, emojis, influencer-tagging. Come up in social search, get curated and republished, and make a visual impact as well.<br>•  Hashtags that are recommended based on current engagement and outcomes, rather than whether they are &quot;trending&quot; (trending = many accounts sending posts with a hashtag; it says nothing about positive outcomes).<br> <br>What you will experience:<br>•  Building both Android and iOS applications with Flutter<br>•  Learn from mentors and peer feedback in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>•  Brainstorm and implement app features<br>•  Build the fully functional app from start to finish<br>•  Exposure to Rest APIs<br>•  We make you part of the process, so you can earn how to bootstrap your own startup, in case you want to do that<br>•  We ship fast - and with over 250,000 registrations, when put your latest feature into production, your work will be seen and become part of the workflow for thousands of business people.<br> <br>* As a self-funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends who have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time. Should you be selected for a first interview, please do ask what our interns go on to do, either as RiteKit salaried staff or after RiteKit. We'll give you ways to research this.</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Java, Android, Git, Mac OS X, Dart, TDD,

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data. From stock quotes to Twitter streams, Apache logs to WordPress blogs, our products are extending what's possible with data, delivering on the promise that good things come from connecting the dots. We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries (and counting!), 18 timezones and 30 different languages into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>Engineering</strong> <strong>Philosophy</strong></strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on really anything, regardless of their role within the company.</p><p>Right now, we are on the lookout for a talented <strong>Senior</strong> <strong>Java</strong> <strong>Engineer</strong> to join our <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> team and focusing on the distributed aspects of Elasticsearch. This role can be based (pretty much) anywhere in the world.</p><p><strong><strong>What</strong> <strong>You</strong> <strong>Will</strong> <strong>Be</strong> <strong>Doing:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Elasticsearch’s internal systems that support concurrent and consistent indexing across multiple machines.</li><li>Cluster coordination and how it responds to nodes leaving and joining the cluster.</li><li>Shard allocation, recovery and migration.</li><li>Backup solutions (a.k.a Snapshot and Restore).</li><li>Cross cluster replication of data to support disaster recovery and geo-replication.</li><li>Look into all kind of issues, including performance or concurrency issues, and propose solutions.</li><li>Supporting our support engineers with the harder problems.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>What</strong> <strong>you</strong> <strong>bring</strong> <strong>along:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>We are looking for strong engineers that can work on complex systems.</li><li>You are able to take on projects and guide them from beginning to end. This covers both technical design and working with other engineers to develop needed components.</li><li>You demonstrate the ability to build and debug features that involve multiple subsystems and run on multiple machines.</li><li>You are comfortable with concurrency and asynchronous execution.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Bonus points for knowledge of:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Distributed systems internals</li><li>Data stores</li><li>Search, analytics, Lucene</li><li>Strong knowledge of the JDK</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Additional</strong> <strong>Information:</strong></strong></p><p>We're looking to hire team members invested in realizing the goal of making real-time data exploration easy and available to anyone. As a distributed company, we believe that diversity drives our vibe! Whether you're looking to launch a new career or grow an existing one, Elastic is the type of company where you can balance great work with great life.</p><ul><li>Competitive pay based on the work you do here and not your previous salary</li><li>Stock options</li><li>Global minimum of 16 weeks of paid in full parental leave (moms &amp; dads)</li><li>Generous vacation time and one week of volunteer time off</li><li>Your age is only a number. It doesn't matter if you're just out of college or your children are; we need you for what you can do.</li></ul><p>Elastic is an Equal Employment employer committed to the principles of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action for all applicants and employees.

Currently, our backend is written mostly in Scala and Node.js. We use Scala for data processing and to power our machine learning algorithms. Node is used as a web framework to facilitate the interaction with our customers via various APIs. We make extensive use of AWS, and use any component we find suitable within our architecture, so we can focus on building our proprietary tech.</p><p>We’re not afraid to challenge our choices, we love open source and above all, we’re a product driven company so technology is at the core of everything we do. You can check out our full stack on <a href='http://stackshare.io/findify' rel='nofollow'>StackShare</a>.</p><p><strong>Our development culture:</strong></p><p>We are a small team that moves fast and iterates. We run weekly sprints, code reviews, testing, and once your code is submitted it gets pushed to production through our continuous deployment infrastructure (Jenkins). We put a lot of emphasis on code style, cleanliness and robustness. You will get to work with amazing engineers specializing in machine learning and distributed systems.</p><p><strong>What you can expect from us:</strong></p><p>You’ll have the opportunity to make a real impact on the product, company vision and culture.

At Pyrofex, we do things differently: we hire great engineers, give them the tools to do great things, and expect them to do so. We are invested in each team members growth and foster a workplace that celebrates accomplishments and hard work.</p><p>Pyrofex is hiring. Show us your best work.</p><p>About Us</p><p>Pyrofex Corporation is changing the blockchain game and quickly growing a world-class team to do it. As Utah Valley’s first cryptocurrency startup, founded in 2016 by ex-Googlers Mike Stay and Nash Foster, Pyrofex is busy creating next-generation blockchain platforms that are simple, secure, and always reliable. We take pride in our work. We set high expectations for everyone, from our founders to each team member, and as a result we deliver extraordinary products and services.</p><p>At Pyrofex, we hire for strength, not for lack of weakness. We hire for capability and talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hire people who have a passion for quality and innovation. Each team member achieves great things in an environment supporting both independence and collaboration.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>You collaborate well with others to design and architect our complex systems. You take the amorphous sets of needs and use cases and distill these into written designs and specifications. You demonstrate a fastidious attention to detail, knowledge of your programming tools, and the ability to regularly produce working, correct code.</p><p>Pyrofex hires engineers at all levels of experience—from current students to engineers with decades of experience. After all, one of our founders has a Ph.D., and the other dropped out of college, twice! The path we've taken to get this far is unique and we suspect the same will be true of our best employees.</p><p>We are most interested in hiring programmers with knowledge of functional programming, a background in computer science, and can program in Scala. However, if you think this job is for you, we'll take a look.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>Our Software Engineers will help us deliver various products and platforms, which are written in Scala, C/C++, Python, Rust, and JavaScript. The engineers on this team will design, implement, test, deploy, and manage a large-scale global software system using Linux and the JVM. Pyrofex builds cryptocurrency systems and large-scale distributed and decentralized applications.</p><p>Five years ago, we thought things like SRE and DevOps would make it clear what &quot;deploy and manage&quot; meant for the future, but now we know we were wrong. The future is changing too fast and our job is to keep up. That said, from time to time, we all have to get out of bed at 2AM to deal with something broken.</p><p>If this sounds good to you, then e-mail us at <strong><a href='mailto:jobs@pyrofex.net' rel='nofollow'>jobs@pyrofex.net</a></strong> with the subject line, “SIGN ME UP!” and your resume or linkedin profile. We would also enjoy a cover letter telling us about your work ethic and your favorite project. If you can send us examples of your code, that would be most excellent.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/173627?reset=False&amp;ra=WecHwmYEr1m&amp;oqs=a%3DWecHwmYEr1m' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>New Technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with a highly intelligent and productive team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full Health benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great communication amongst the team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Build from the ground up and make progress!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote Work Available</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

As a pioneering member of the core services team at Reaction Commerce your primary focus will be advancement of the Reaction platform where data streams are the source of truth. This is a hands on role. You will write functional code to build microservices and establish patterns that will be used by the rest of the team. <br><br>Responsibilities<br><br>Here is a list of the type of work that you’ll be spending the majority of your time on:<br><br><br>* Produce clean well documented idiomatic code.<br><br>* Be creative and experiment with new solutions while being pragmatic and committed to code optimization, maintainability, and quality.<br><br>* Design and develop highly scalable, observable, functional microservices from prototype to production.<br><br>* Create intelligent monitors for key metrics to understand service and overall system health.<br><br>* Learn and teach your fellow engineers new technologies and architectures.<br><br>* Be a storyteller and clearly document designs, tradeoffs, and lessons learned from prototyping and your Hammock Time.<br><br>* Improve productivity of the team through code abstractions and custom tooling, like &nbsp;custom libraries and project templates.<br><br><br><br><br>Required qualifications<br><br>Here is a list of our hard requirements, which we’ve worked to keep short. We believe you’ll excel in this role if you possess the following: <br><br><br>* Experience working in a functional programming language, with a preference for declarative implementations and immutability.<br><br>* Strong experience designing web-based APIs in REST or GraphQL.<br><br>* Understanding of systems design, algorithms, and data structures.<br><br>* Demonstrable knowledge of queues, distributed logs, and streaming systems of various types.<br><br>* Experience mentoring high quality teams, and instilling a mindset of engineering excellence (e.g. TDD, pairing, code reviews, design documentation)<br><br>* Experience and knowledge of the JVM and the Java ecosystem in addition to compile to JVM languages.<br><br>* Ability to write clear, effective documentation.<br><br><br><br><br>We value your knowledge and skills more than an arbitrary amount of experience using any specific technology or a university degree in a specific field. As a Senior Software Engineer, we expect that you’ll have the skills and knowledge that are typically gained working on production applications for many years and studying in a university Computer Science program, but we don’t care how you’ve acquired those skills or how long it took you.<br><br>Bonus qualifications<br><br>The ideal candidate will have deep experience in a few of these topics<br><br><br>* A polyglot background with languages that present varied programming paradigms and perspectives. <br><br>* Experience writing libraries or abstractions with declarative interfaces.<br><br>* Prior work using CQRS &amp; event-sourcing.<br><br>* Experience using Kafka, Kafka Streams, Docker, Docker Compose, and GraphQL.<br><br>* Familiarity with relational, document, and key-value store databases and knowledge of common data modeling patterns used in each.<br><br>* Enough devops experience to get your projects deployed to AWS.<br><br>* Interest in programming in Clojure.<br><br><br><br><br>Characteristics<br><br>As a distributed team building open source software, we understand that being a great software engineer is much more than having a deep technical skillset. Our culture is one of communication, character, cooperation, and competence. We believe that people who have these foundational characteristics will be able to hit the ground running.<br><br><br>* Motivated, self-starter who can work in a distributed team environment<br><br>* Open-minded mentality<br><br>* Goal oriented personality<br><br>* Empathy for customers, community, and co-workers <br><br>* Tendency to teach others what you know and excitement for sharing knowledge<br><br>* Growth oriented mindset and a desire to be better today than yesterday<br><br>* Desire to deliver an exceptional customer experience<br><br>* Critical thinker who will work to solve the right problem<br><br>* Cooperative attitude and an ability to pair program effectively with other engineers<br><br>* Ability to think holistically for a given project or problem<br><br><br><br><br>Details<br><br><br>* Position: &nbsp;Full Time<br><br>* Compensation: Salary commensurate with experience, stock options, medical and dental benefits<br><br>* Location: Americas Time zone<br><br>* Hours: <br><br><br><br>* ~40-50 hours/week<br><br>* You’ll be expected to make team meetings and work at least 5 hours/day that overlap with 9AM-5PM Pacific<br><br><br><br><br><p>See more jobs at <span>Reaction Commerce</span></p></div></div>"

The platform allows customers to get instant bus prices, make reservations and track the bus via an app. We are making the process of finding and reserving a bus easy and smooth, a real revolution to the extremely fragmented $14B US market for charter buses. BookBuses brings transparency and help the end-customers find the best bus provider for their budget and comfort level. The intern will have the chance to experience the excitement of opening new cities and growing.</p><p>About the Co-Founders: Oscar Jung started his career at A.T. Kearney and later served as Vice President for Groupon Southeast Asia. At Lightbank Venture Capital he co-founded online social gifting site Boomerang that was sold to Groupon. </p><p>About you: We are looking for a high-energy, entrepreneurial and self-starting individual. So we are looking for someone that thrives in unstructured environments, who loves to bring order to a chaotic environment by creating processes, rather respecting pre-existing ones. Detail orientation is a must, startup experience is a strong plus, no tech knowledge needed.</p><p>Learning &amp; tangible skills: Interns will learn to make plans and ideas become reality, converting a business model into a real company following the “lean startup” principles. We will develop hypothesis and assumptions, test them and make strategic decisions based on test results. The interns will be entrepreneurs within the startup, with a massive impact to be generated. Rare opportunity!</p><p>We offer free food, drinks, lots of fun, and a basic stipend.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Passion, Attention to Detail, Willingness to Learn</div><div>Compensation</div><div>$1K–$2K<br>No Equity</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to BookBuses</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/getbounce/jobs/352780-business-development-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/getbounce/jobs/352780-business-development-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Business Development Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/getbounce/jobs/352780-business-development-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Bounce</a></div><div>New York City, San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bookbuses/jobs/347403-business-partner-growing-profitable-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bookbuses/jobs/347403-business-partner-growing-profitable-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Business Partner Growing Profita...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bookbuses/jobs/347403-business-partner-growing-profitable-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>BookBuses</a></div><div>New York City, Washington DC</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/insights-network/jobs/358310-crypto-blogger-outreach?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/insights-network/jobs/358310-crypto-blogger-outreach?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Crypto Blogger Outreach</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/insights-network/jobs/358310-crypto-blogger-outreach?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Insights Network</a></div><div>Miami, San Francisco, Chicago</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/mpower-financing/jobs/177823-customer-success-analyst?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/mpower-financing/jobs/177823-customer-success-analyst?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Customer Success Analyst</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/mpower-financing/jobs/177823-customer-success-analyst?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>MPOWER Financing</a></div><div>Washington DC</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/handshake-15/jobs/309783-research-and-data-analyst-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/handshake-15/jobs/309783-research-and-data-analyst-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Research and Data Analyst Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/handshake-15/jobs/309783-research-and-data-analyst-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Handshake</a></div><div>Washington DC</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/rayka-1/jobs/226935-marketing-digital-travel-consultant-student-travel-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/rayka-1/jobs/226935-marketing-digital-travel-consultant-student-travel-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Marketing &amp;

This is because the price transparency for hiring charter buses is nonexistent. BookBuses provides an instant price comparison and matches with the specific budget and requirements.<br>The operator side:<br>An increasing amount of bus bookings begin online, but most bus operators lack the resources to attract online traffic and rely on yellow pages and inbound sales. WIth BookBuses, the operators can now differentiate themselves on quality. For the bus operator, this means less resources spent on marketing, manual quoting and customer handling.
