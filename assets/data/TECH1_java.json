We’re pragmatic crafters who believe in smart and focused development, building clients’ products just as we do our own: investing heavily in design, iterating rapidly to validate and falsify ideas, and pursuing perfection in every interaction. We learned a lot of interesting things along the way about the right way to ship software, and we're now bringing our incredible software product experience to larger companies like <strong>Verizon, Google, Intel, Twitter, Sony, L'Oréal</strong>— and we do this all with a fully distributed team.<br><br></div><div>We believe that well-made software can change the world, no matter how small or simple a product might be. We also believe that poorly-made software —badly-designed, badly-developed, or badly-supported— is a preventable tragedy.<br><br></div><div>Mokriya’s mission is to make great software: for ourselves, for our clients and most importantly for our users.<br><br></div><div><strong>About You<br></strong><br></div><div>You love to build.

deliverables and sprints and keep the velocity even. &nbsp;We rarely work weekends (ok, sometimes if we have a good idea) and we try to keep things flexible. &nbsp;</p><p>This means you&nbsp;get to see your&nbsp;kids school plays and games, you can run errands when there's no traffic and so on. &nbsp;So if you are someone who can manage flexibility and still get your stuff done then we are a good fit. &nbsp;If you need a lot of structure and a boss who delights in holding&nbsp;your nose to the grindstone we wish you the best of luck.</p><p>It's a trade-off. &nbsp;We don't have as much collegiality as other places. &nbsp;We are just a solid place to do good work and feel good about the work you do.</p><p>We also have a very strict no a**holes policy. &nbsp;That goes for both clients and staff. &nbsp;We avoid clients who are not nice people. &nbsp;It's better that way. &nbsp;We are also fairly diverse. Come from different places, with different faces. &nbsp;But we&nbsp;all agree that being honest, direct, and decent is by far the simplest way for professionals to act. &nbsp;And when we fail we hope&nbsp;you'll tell us in an honest, direct, and decent way. &nbsp;And then work with us to improve.</p><p>A lot of our clients are in the public sector and we try to deliver value by helping our clients be more agile and get things done by cutting through their bureaucracy. &nbsp;We believe very much in the power of agile methods and practice them both at work and in our private lives. &nbsp;We hope you join us.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible work arrangements</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>High end hardware</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Time for side projects</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Despite being new to the market, Instilled is built on a mature product with a solid client base and consolidates a wealth of experience and technology from our parent group. We are a small, agile team in a much larger learning technology business that is successful and passionate about creating outstanding learning tools.\\n\\nWhat Instilled provides is a YouTube like experience for learners to discover content and progress at their own pace—it was originally a video platform, so included are a host of video features such as auto-captioning, auto-translation and commenting etc.\\n\\nWe are still in the early stages of this products transformation but we have huge aspirations and want developers that relish the opportunity to create industry-leading products.\\n\\nHow will I know this is for me?\\n\\nFirst, this is a UK-specific role.&nbsp;Candidates must be eligible to work in the UK.&nbsp;Our team does have a US component, but we are not currently hiring for&nbsp;any US roles.\\n\\nOur ideal candidate is friendly, enthusiastic and just as passionate about technology as we are. The team spans multiple offices and time-zones so a self-starter attitude and excellent communication skills are key. We know not everyone has experience of the learning industry but that’s fine, we want people that understand code. Our current tech stack is comprised of Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, AngularJS, and others. These things change though, so whilst prior experience is advantageous, the key is being able to adapt to whatever technology the task demands. We look for developers that have an opinion about how technology can be applied, but remain equally open minded about new or different approaches. Working well in a team is vital as this role will be fundamental in shaping our product architecture - clearly articulating a concept and nurturing other team members is hugely important.\\n\\nOk, sounds great! What do I do?\\n\\nThis is a unique opportunity to join a dynamic product team that is taking an impressive client list in to a whole new world of learning. If this sounds like a good fit then we would like to hear from you. Please send over a cover letter explaining why and attach your CV. Feel free to outline any achievements you are particularly proud of and include a link to code you can share. Extra points for your best joke!  </div> </div>",

It has often been said that data is the new currency.  Unfortunately, maximizing the value of data is often easier said than done.  On one side, transacting via individual point to point integrations carries a lot of overhead in both business development and technical integration efforts.  On the other, going through big aggregators introduces opacity in the pricing and provenance of the data.  At Narrative, we help our customers get value from their data by building a central auction platform to reduce the friction and tooling to increase the transparency in this process.</p><p>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to jump in and take major systems and user-facing features from design to launch.  Here's where we are now:</p><p>- We are operating in Amazon Web Services.  Our services are mainly deployed on EC2 provisioned with Terraform.</p><p>- We also heavily use other technology on AWS such as DynamoDB, S3, and RDS.</p><p>- Our backend includes a data ingestion web service with supporting Kinesis consumers, along with a growing array of Spark projects.  It’s written mostly in Scala, with a smattering of Python for lambda functions.</p><p>- We sit somewhere in the middle of the “Scala as a worse Haskell” and “Scala as a better Java” spectrum.  We love functional programming and we do make use of libraries like cats, but at the same time we heavily favor core language features and have no intention of rewriting everything using Free Monads.</p><p>- Our frontend is written in Typescript with Angular2 and a supporting API running on Node, and is deployed and monitored using much the same supporting tech as the backend.</p><p>- Other services we use include: GitHub, CircleCI, DataDog.</p><p>Apply by sending your resume to hiring@narrative.io.</p><p>We are hiring for the backend role and are building the team with a remote-first mindset.</p><p>- Scala Backend Engineer: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/join/backend.html' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/join/backend.html</a></p><p>Some more useful links:</p><p>- Find out more about Company Culture: <a href='http://transparency.narrative.io/culture' rel='nofollow'>http://transparency.narrative.io/culture</a>.</p>",

They've asked me to find a people with lots of enthusiasm, ambition, questions (always find ways to improve!) and, of course, talent!</p> \n <p>They are very well set up for remote working, and, with disparate teams scattered across the UK and Europe, it is part of their culture.</p> \n <p>You'll join a team of like-minded Developers who you can learn from and contribute to. Currently, they are undergoing a number of large, transforming projects that will see you, amongst other things, building a new eCommerce platform from the ground up that will be visible across the world! For this, you'll need creative thinking (how can we do this best?), patience (why won't this work?), know-how (ah, that's how you do it!), and a collaborative mind-set (I'll go and tell others how I did it!). You'll also need to be comfortable working in an Agile environment, using DevOps practices, and using cloud providers for a multitude of different things. Therefore, if you come from a narrow-viewed Java background- i.e. where you've not been exposed to the full stack- you probably won't be right for this role.</p> \n <p>You won't be someone whose favourite spot in a room is the corner. On your own. With nobody to talk to… You'll be a lively person who enjoys communicating your ideas with others- be that in person or via an online communication tool.</p> \n <p>At a glance, the skills you'll need experience with are:</p> \n <p>Essential:</p> \n <ul>\n  <li>Java (knowledge around versions 8-11)</li>\n  <li>Spring/Spring Boot</li>\n  <li>REST APIs</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Good to know:</p> \n <ul>\n  <li>NoSQL DB technologies such as Mongo, Cassandra etc.</li>\n  <li>Kubernetes &amp; docker</li>\n  <li>Jenkins</li>\n  <li>AWS</li>\n  <li>Reactive programming (i.e. Spring Webflux)&quot;</li>\n  <li>Test Driven Development (TDD) and Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/ CD)</li>\n </ul>\n <p>You'll get a rewarding role that will see you contributing to a team and projects in which you'll be able to see the fruits of your labour and in which you'll have a genuine say in the direction of the project you're working on- it's always a team effort.</p> \n <p>The salary on offer for the roles is rather open and ranges between £35-55k plus benefits, and the role is based in Nottingham.</p> \n <p>If you feel you'd be a good match for the role, then please either apply or give me a buzz to discuss it J</p> \n <p><strong>Mid-Snr Java Developer- Nottingham - £35-55k</strong></p>\n</div>",

We believe in transparency, diversity, merit and fostering a culture of accountability, personal impact and career growth. \n  <br> \n  <br>As a member of the first few engineering teams at Crisp you have will have unique opportunity to take products from concept to production as we build towards our goal of becoming the global technology platform for the food industry. You will work closely with the co-founder team and be part of not just defining and implementing our technology and product strategy, but also the way we work together as we scale our company. \n  <br> \n  <br>Demonstrated technical impact is a requirement, but management experience is not. We know that great products are built by collaborative individuals, not by managers. We also know that many amazing developers can be excellent managers, but that's often not what they prefer.

Now we’re building an ambitious language distribution platform so that no engineer ever has to suffer dependency hell again, and we need your help to do it! \n  <br> \n  <br>This position is open to full-time telecommuters anywhere in North America. You can also choose to work from our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC. \n  <br> \n  <br>This position is open to both junior (including fresh out of school) and senior applicants. The salary for this position will be commensurate with your experience. \n  <br> \n  <br>What You’ll be Doing \n  <br> \n  <br>As a Data Engineer, you will create and maintain a data processing pipeline to feed our automated build systems with information about various open source languages and package updates. This work includes automating processing of open source package update feeds from language repositories including PyPI (Python), CPAN (Perl), Maven (Java), NPM (JavaScript), RubyGems. You will also be creating web crawlers for eco-systems without well defined APIs. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our day to day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development with Pivotal Tracker as our project management tool. We’re always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so. \n  <br> \n  <br>We’re a polyglot company building our system using Golang, Python, Elm, Javascript, Perl, Docker, Kubernetes, DCOS, CircleCI, and other modern tools. Quality is as important as speed. We’re building for the long run, so you’ll need to enjoy writing tests and documentation too. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Highfive for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and Google Drive. \n  <br> \n  <br>We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code. \n  <br> \n  <br>Working at ActiveState \n  <br> \n  <br>ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We’re all about working together to find the best solutions, and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all of us. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our company is a team of 40+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles&nbsp; including software development and QA. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we’re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly don’t lack for ambition! But even though we’re ambitious we don’t expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches. \n  <br> \n  <br>What’s in it for You \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The chance to work on a project that will change the work lives of developers around the world. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Competitive salary, bonus, and stock option plan. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Requirements \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience creating and maintaining complex software systems along with the ability to design non-trivial applications and components from scratch. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The ability to write clean, well-tested code with clear documentation. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Deep experience with at least one programming language, and shallow experience with several. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical. You’ll need to work closely with your developer teammates, as well as be able to have coherent conversations with people from QA, sales, marketing, and other parts of the company. \n  <br> \n  <br>* A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The ability to help others on the team become better at their jobs through mentoring, thoughtful code reviews, and generally being a team player. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Assets \n  <br> \n  <br>If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Data processing technologies, including but not limited to Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Presto, Luigi, Airflow, Storm, etc. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Golang code, especially large code bases. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Microservices and message queues. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Docker and Kubernetes. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Perl, Python, Tcl, or Ruby, especially an understanding of their respective language communities and toolchains. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",
