improves the discussion of news articles by allowing users to tag incorrect facts, bad reasoning or uncivil behavior. It is a place where people can comment on news in depth, and share their opinions through social media. </p><p>When multiple people have &quot;fisked&quot; the same article, the system produces a page which highlights the flaws or qualities in the text, as determined by a statistical test of significance of the (human-input) tags. In short, it has the potential to fact-check all online news/content in real time.</p><p>Additionally, by allowing users to fisk each other's comments, we create a granular, peer-reviewed discussion of the topic which is much more useful - and useable -  for interested readers. This allows us to build in a Troll Filter which will enable readers to weed out bad-faith commentary, while preserving Fiskkit's &quot;No Censorship&quot; principle. </p><p>It's the future of online engagement.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Francisco</span>, <span>United States</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>$21K Seed in 2014</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Digital Media</span>, <span>News</span>, <span>Blogging Platforms</span>, <span>Writers</span></div><div><div></div><a href='http://twitter.com/fiskkit' rel='nofollow'>@fiskkit</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://fiskkit.com' rel='nofollow'>fiskkit.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/645/391645-448935d3377d1e925a3c4868e17c8b5d97850972.jpg?1409434617' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/647/391647-1e2834f49606b3cc6be857b62670a3939201a96a.jpg?1409434718' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/653/391653-4abd9dfabc6ac13a568b82e72b51dd09de011e30.png?1409439518' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/654/391654-3db0f14b8aa81d645cbb9119181aa85131aa4726.png?1409439529' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/658/391658-79c6f923d2c1e0cbb66632c67a0449fed8efaa64.jpg?1409441817' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/386434-fiskkit?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;Fiskkit&quot;

We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.</p><p>ConsenSys is presently comprised of a number of core personnel — some of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development, acquisitions, investments, or the formation of joint ventures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Brooklyn</span>, Remote

These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.</p><p>ConsenSys is presently comprised of a number of core personnel — some of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development, acquisitions, investments, or the formation of joint ventures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Remote</span>, <span>Brooklyn</span>, Remote

We give back plenty but are not able to compensate interns financially.</p><p>RiteKit interns share insights on the team, experience, career boosts: <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a></p><p>At our core:<br>&quot;Enhance&quot;: this feature is the gem at the center the RiteBoost automation dashboard and RiteForge, the social publishing SaaS. </p><p>The customer's customized &quot;Enhance&quot; does any/all of the following in one click: <br>• semantically determines topics of a post and auto-hashtags them for current and historical engagement <br>• Auto-emojify<br>• converts URLs in social posts to a custom tiny URL with a baked-in advertisement<br>• if the words in your post are not good as hashtags, Enhance adds up to two at the end of the post<br>• extracts a good image from images embedded in the body of a page, if the page's URL is in your post<br>• optional: highlight text or add &quot;quotes&quot; around text before Enhancing - this makes an image from the text, with a customer-branded image background.<br>• author attribution<br>• even more options are available</p><p>We serve enterprise customers, too: <a href='https://ritekit.com/api-demo' rel='nofollow'>https://ritekit.com/api-demo</a></p><p>We're growing fast, gaining traction, we're going big, and all the while, our culture continues to improve. No one works &quot;for&quot; RiteKit; we listen, mentor, involve people in the decision making. We work &quot;with&quot; people not above them. Please feel welcome to ask any of us to explain what the difference means to to them. See Hashtag Academy in Medium to see their interviews and read what they say about our impact on careers.</p><p>What do our interns do after us? Search RiteTag in LinkedIn, then do an advanced  search to see the people.

If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. </p><p>FIRM REQUIREMENTS:<br>•  64 bit Mac / Macbook / Hackintosh core i7 preferred<br>•  Must write clean, re-usable code (we will test you)<br>•  3 months X 20 hours/week commitment<br>•  Our internships are UNPAID. No salary, no stipend, etc. <br>•  Desire to work in a startup environment, able to self-manage and work remotely* <br>•  Must have built at least two Android and/or iOS apps with Flutter<br>•  Git experience<br>* Remotely = you would work as we all do, from home or where we live.</p><p>Beneficial but not required:<br>•  Fluency with Java<br>•  Basic understanding of Android extensions/custom keyboards<br>•  TDD/Testing frameworks awareness (JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, etc.)</p><p>We greatly limit the number of interns we work with in each division. Applications are now being taken for start dates 1~3 months from now.</p><p>Hashtags, yay!</p><p>No, that's not what we do. </p><p>So, what DO we do? <br>Data-driven, machine learning-infused social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>• Total social media optimization - avoid paying for ads by intelligently automating everything shared to social with images, GIFs, emojis, influencer-tagging. Come up in social search, get curated and republished, and make a visual impact as well.<br>•  Hashtags that are recommended based on current engagement and outcomes, rather than whether they are &quot;trending&quot; (trending = many accounts sending posts with a hashtag; it says nothing about positive outcomes).<br> <br>What you will experience:<br>•  Building both Android and iOS applications with Flutter<br>•  Learn from mentors and peer feedback in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>•  Brainstorm and implement app features<br>•  Build the fully functional app from start to finish<br>•  Exposure to Rest APIs<br>•  We make you part of the process, so you can earn how to bootstrap your own startup, in case you want to do that<br>•  We ship fast - and with over 250,000 registrations, when put your latest feature into production, your work will be seen and become part of the workflow for thousands of business people.<br> <br>* As a self-funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends who have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time. Should you be selected for a first interview, please do ask what our interns go on to do, either as RiteKit salaried staff or after RiteKit. We'll give you ways to research this.</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the

rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning,

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data.

It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization.

Currently, our backend is written mostly in Scala and Node.js. We use Scala for data processing and to power our machine learning algorithms. Node is used as a web framework to facilitate the interaction with our customers via various APIs. We make extensive use of AWS, and use any component we find suitable within our architecture, so we can focus on building our proprietary tech.</p><p>We’re not afraid to challenge our choices, we love open source and above all, we’re a product driven company so technology is at the core of everything we do. You can check out our full stack on <a href='http://stackshare.io/findify' rel='nofollow'>StackShare</a>.</p><p><strong>Our development culture:</strong></p><p>We are a small team that moves fast and iterates. We run weekly sprints, code reviews, testing, and once your code is submitted it gets pushed to production through our continuous deployment infrastructure (Jenkins). We put a lot of emphasis on code style, cleanliness and robustness. You will get to work with amazing engineers specializing in machine learning and distributed systems.</p><p><strong>What you can expect from us:</strong></p><p>You’ll have the opportunity to make a real impact on the product, company vision and culture.

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

At Pyrofex, we do things differently: we hire great engineers, give them the tools to do great things, and expect them to do so. We are invested in each team members growth and foster a workplace that celebrates accomplishments and hard work.</p><p>Pyrofex is hiring. Show us your best work.</p><p>About Us</p><p>Pyrofex Corporation is changing the blockchain game and quickly growing a world-class team to do it. As Utah Valley’s first cryptocurrency startup, founded in 2016 by ex-Googlers Mike Stay and Nash Foster, Pyrofex is busy creating next-generation blockchain platforms that are simple, secure, and always reliable. We take pride in our work. We set high expectations for everyone, from our founders to each team member, and as a result we deliver extraordinary products and services.</p><p>At Pyrofex, we hire for strength, not for lack of weakness. We hire for capability and talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;We hire people who have a passion for quality and innovation. Each team member achieves great things in an environment supporting both independence and collaboration.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>You collaborate well with others to design and architect our complex systems. You take the amorphous sets of needs and use cases and distill these into written designs and specifications. You demonstrate a fastidious attention to detail, knowledge of your programming tools, and the ability to regularly produce working, correct code.</p><p>Pyrofex hires engineers at all levels of experience—from current students to engineers with decades of experience. After all, one of our founders has a Ph.D., and the other dropped out of college, twice! The path we've taken to get this far is unique and we suspect the same will be true of our best employees.</p><p>We are most interested in hiring programmers with knowledge of functional programming, a background in computer science, and can program in Scala. However, if you think this job is for you, we'll take a look.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>Our Software Engineers will help us deliver various products and platforms, which are written in Scala, C/C++, Python, Rust, and JavaScript. The engineers on this team will design, implement, test, deploy, and manage a large-scale global software system using Linux and the JVM. Pyrofex builds cryptocurrency systems and large-scale distributed and decentralized applications.</p><p>Five years ago, we thought things like SRE and DevOps would make it clear what &quot;deploy and manage&quot; meant for the future, but now we know we were wrong. The future is changing too fast and our job is to keep up.

As a pioneering member of the core services team at Reaction Commerce your primary focus will be advancement of the Reaction platform where data streams are the source of truth. This is a hands on role. You will write functional code to build microservices and establish patterns that will be used by the rest of the team. <br><br>Responsibilities<br><br>Here is a list of the type of work that you’ll be spending the majority of your time on:<br><br><br>* Produce clean well documented idiomatic code.<br><br>* Be creative and experiment with new solutions while being pragmatic and committed to code optimization, maintainability, and quality.<br><br>* Design and develop highly scalable, observable, functional microservices from prototype to production.<br><br>* Create intelligent monitors for key metrics to understand service and overall system health.<br><br>* Learn and teach your fellow engineers new technologies and architectures.<br><br>* Be a storyteller and clearly document designs, tradeoffs, and lessons learned from prototyping and your Hammock Time.<br><br>* Improve productivity of the team through code abstractions and custom tooling, like &nbsp;custom libraries and project templates.<br><br><br><br><br>Required qualifications<br><br>Here is a list of our hard requirements, which we’ve worked to keep short. We believe you’ll excel in this role if you possess the following: <br><br><br>* Experience working in a functional programming language, with a preference for declarative implementations and immutability.<br><br>* Strong experience designing web-based APIs in REST or GraphQL.<br><br>* Understanding of systems design, algorithms, and data structures.<br><br>* Demonstrable knowledge of queues, distributed logs, and streaming systems of various types.<br><br>* Experience mentoring high quality teams, and instilling a mindset of engineering excellence (e.g. TDD, pairing, code reviews, design documentation)<br><br>* Experience and knowledge of the JVM and the Java ecosystem in addition to compile to JVM languages.<br><br>* Ability to write clear, effective documentation.<br><br><br><br><br>We value your knowledge and skills more than an arbitrary amount of experience using any specific technology or a university degree in a specific field.

The platform allows customers to get instant bus prices, make reservations and track the bus via an app. We are making the process of finding and reserving a bus easy and smooth, a real revolution to the extremely fragmented $14B US market for charter buses. BookBuses brings transparency and help the end-customers find the best bus provider for their budget and comfort level. The intern will have the chance to experience the excitement of opening new cities and growing.</p><p>About the Co-Founders: Oscar Jung started his career at A.T. Kearney and later served as Vice President for Groupon Southeast Asia. At Lightbank Venture Capital he co-founded online social gifting site Boomerang that was sold to Groupon. </p><p>About you: We are looking for a high-energy, entrepreneurial and self-starting individual. So we are looking for someone that thrives in unstructured environments, who loves to bring order to a chaotic environment by creating processes, rather respecting pre-existing ones. Detail orientation is a must, startup experience is a strong plus, no tech knowledge needed.</p><p>Learning &amp; tangible skills: Interns will learn to make plans and ideas become reality, converting a business model into a real company following the “lean startup” principles. We will develop hypothesis and assumptions, test them and make strategic decisions based on test results. The interns will be entrepreneurs within the startup, with a massive impact to be generated. Rare opportunity!</p><p>We offer free food, drinks, lots of fun, and a basic stipend.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Passion, Attention to Detail, Willingness to Learn</div><div>Compensation</div><div>$1K–$2K<br>No Equity</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to BookBuses</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/getbounce/jobs/352780-business-development-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/getbounce/jobs/352780-business-development-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Business Development Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/getbounce/jobs/352780-business-development-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Bounce</a></div><div>New York City, San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bookbuses/jobs/347403-business-partner-growing-profitable-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bookbuses/jobs/347403-business-partner-growing-profitable-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Business Partner Growing Profita...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bookbuses/jobs/347403-business-partner-growing-profitable-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>BookBuses</a></div><div>New York City, Washington DC</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/insights-network/jobs/358310-crypto-blogger-outreach?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/insights-network/jobs/358310-crypto-blogger-outreach?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Crypto Blogger Outreach</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/insights-network/jobs/358310-crypto-blogger-outreach?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Insights Network</a></div><div>Miami, San Francisco, Chicago</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/mpower-financing/jobs/177823-customer-success-analyst?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/mpower-financing/jobs/177823-customer-success-analyst?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Customer Success Analyst</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/mpower-financing/jobs/177823-customer-success-analyst?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>MPOWER Financing</a></div><div>Washington DC</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/handshake-15/jobs/309783-research-and-data-analyst-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/handshake-15/jobs/309783-research-and-data-analyst-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Research and Data Analyst Intern</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/handshake-15/jobs/309783-research-and-data-analyst-intern?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Handshake</a></div><div>Washington DC</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/rayka-1/jobs/226935-marketing-digital-travel-consultant-student-travel-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/rayka-1/jobs/226935-marketing-digital-travel-consultant-student-travel-startup?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Marketing &amp;

This is because the price transparency for hiring charter buses is nonexistent. BookBuses provides an instant price comparison and matches with the specific budget and requirements.<br>The operator side:<br>An increasing amount of bus bookings begin online, but most bus operators lack the resources to attract online traffic and rely on yellow pages and inbound sales. WIth BookBuses, the operators can now differentiate themselves on quality. For the bus operator, this means less resources spent on marketing, manual quoting and customer handling.

    "content": "h1. For developers, insurtech is the playground you never knew you wanted. <br /><br />We’re taking on big, never-before-solved problems with new technologies - all while fully funded and facing massive growth in a stable, wealthy industry.<br /><br />When you join us, we’ll kit you out with a full spec Macbook Pro, likely set you up to pair with another developer and get you into the codebase as quickly as possible. As a startup, we need you to be curious, tenacious and driven, constantly looking for new and better ways to build our complex product using new and better processes, tools, frameworks, whatever it takes.<br /><br />In our small team there is enormous scope to have your say, to influence how we work, what we work on and, ultimately, what Wrisk will become for our future millions of international users. And we'll offer you some ownership in the business, so you'll share in every success ahead of us.<br /><br />h2. What you’ll do<br /><br />As a full stack developer you will take features from start to finish, collaborating with others as you go. You will be often required to turn your hand to something new, possibly something you have not done before; you might pair with a specialist in areas where we have in-house expertise or following industry best practices from your own research. <br /><br />You'll be working very closely with CTO Alex to build out a micro-services architected platform - the engine that powers the Wrisk app. This platform integrates with many clients from our own app to external data sources and third party solution providers, so there's a lot to do. <br /><br />Applications are written Kotlin, so demonstrable experience creating production quality JVM based applications is pretty much essential. If you've worked on delivering a mobile friendly RESTful API that would be a bonus, and if that has led you to thinking of tools like Dropwizard and Swagger, all the better. <br /><br />You should have some demonstrable experience using a modern JavaScript technology to build user facing applications. We currently use React/Redux for some of our internal web applications and are migrating our Swift mobile application to React Native so any experience with RN is a huge plus.<br /><br />Finally, you’ll be deploying the apps you’ve written to our environment in AWS. You should be familiar with Infrastructure As Code and containerisation using technologies such as Terraform and Docker.<br /><br />h2. How you’ll work<br /><br />While what you work on is well-structured and organised, how you work is up to you. The office is relaxed, with flexible working available to everyone. You’ll meet with your whole team every morning (remotely by video if you’re away from the office) followed by a quick tech huddle, but other than that your time is your own. If you want to take 10 minutes to clear your head with meditation, a trip to a local hipster coffee shop or a game of table tennis - go for it. Nobody’s clock-watching. We just care that the work gets done, to a high standard, on time.<br /><br />We believe in, and practice, the Lean ideas of build/measure/learn, and will be very happy to show you the kanban storyboard you will be building from. You will participate in, and often lead, our retrospectives, as well as presenting at the bi-weekly showcases, to the wider team, which are essential for ensuring we are all on the same page.<br /><br />We typically start with a workshop to define what we need to achieve, leading to wireframes and perhaps some high level tasks. We refine and test until we believe we have the core of what we want and then we build the smallest amount we can to validate this - sometimes in code, sometimes in prototype. We do regular user testing, rapid prototyping and code spikes to ensure we only build the most-right thing we can right now.<br /><br />h2. What you’ll get<br /><br />Our future actually looks even rosier from inside the company, where we can see what’s on the roadmap and who’s expressed an interest in us. We already have investment and support from some major partners. We’re going places - and we want you with us. You'll help build the path that gets us there, with some equity of your own so you’re properly rewarded when we arrive.<br /><br />We also offer a competitive salary, 30 days holiday allowance (with public holidays on top) and flexible working conditions. We're currently based in Techspace Shoreditch, a short walk from Old Street. Our offices are modern and bright, with the startup-essential posh coffee and ping pong table, as well as indoor bicycle parking and shower."
