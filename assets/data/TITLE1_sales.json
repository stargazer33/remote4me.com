    "content": "Hi. I’m Eric and I’m the Co-Founder & CTO of Itoma 3D Tech. We are a start-up based in Hatfield / North London, UK.<br /><br />Our Vision is to simplify 3D Modelling & 3D Printing using AI, Robotics & Voice technology to make it at our customer's voice command.<br />Big Vision starts with a single niche to make us investable, find a market fit & develop a product so we currently focus on 3D Modelling & 3D Printing for B2B Architecture & Construction and that's the market where we currently develop co-venturing & sales relationships.<br /><br />This is our product roadmap to get us there: <br />itoma.co.uk/3dme-product-demo/ <br />And that’s our long-term strategy:<br />itoma.co.uk/our-3d-tech-strategy/<br /><br />We have pre-seed funding, well defined plan & an amazing tech team to get an edge, MVP, first sales, a couple of Letters of Intent, cooperation for innovation with 2 universities, received SEIS & EIS status for UK investors and currently focus on fundraising & sales.<br /><br /><br /><br />WHAT:<br />We are looking for a person with some sales experience & drive to join our start-up on a flexible, part-time basis for equity with sales commission:<br />1. To finish the development of our sales strategy (Mostly B2B to architecture & construction).<br />2. Continue contacting leads & develop customer sales strategy.<br />3. Get Letters of Intent & sales to help us get funding & develop the product line.<br /><br />Then once we develop sufficiently – to join us full or part-time as a salaried person or continue as an advisor:<br />1. To move to contract stages with B2B sales.<br />2. Develop relationships with new customers.<br />3. And build the proper sales team to eventually manage.<br /><br /><br /><br />PROPOSED IMPACT JD:<br />1 month - pick up relationship with existing companies that we met & contacted.<br />2 months - 1 Letter of Intent<br />3 months - first sales<br />6 months - 1 co-venturing relationship for market fit & product development. Multiple sales.<br />12 months - 2 co-venturing relationships (in total). Sales volumes. Thinking of international possibilities (initially - for prestige to investors for Series A).<br /><br /><br /><br />WHO:<br />We trust that will suit best someone who is already working part-time in sales and looks for the long term but a flexible game with an innovative start-up.<br />Or someone who recently retired or semi-retired and wants to get back in the game (even constant holidays get finally boring after ~1 year of constant travelling – we have an example in our team already!).<br /><br /><br /><br />YOUR MOTIVATION:<br />Your motivation is more important than a perfect experience. We offer flexibility (eg. home based & set your own hours as long as we all get to our impact goals), support and a product that can take practically any shape, size & colour in exchange (to make it this much easier) <br />The possibility to shape the Future is a bonus!<br /><br /><br /><br />You know what they say – set the expectations early but don’t scare everyone off! <br />In other words – we are all people so even if you fulfil some of this stuff but eg. have a passion for 3D Printing, Architecture & Construction & innovative tech – then give us a shout. <br />But most of all - we are a start-up so the main thing is that we are in it together & like us here - you do not expect salary straight away because we simply can't afford it yet but we will offer commission on sales with equity, which can especially pay off if you've got good contacts in Construction & Architecture industry.<br /><br /><br />Best, <br />Eric<br /><br /><br />PS Good start is crucial – we sign a mutual NDA with all people who work with us to have a good & open conversation & then have a couple of conversations to build the big picture of where we are going as well as sales plan.",

We brought Docker to embedded GNU/Linux devices in 2013 and have been building our IoT toolkit ever since.</p><p>Our technology is open, standards-based, and proven in production across a wide range of scenarios from drones, 3D printers, point-of-sale devices, tidal turbines, skyscrapers and more. Our investors include DFJ, Aspect Ventures, GE, and Ericsson.</p><p>Balena is a&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.balena.io%2Fteam%2F' rel='nofollow'>highly distributed, remote-friendly company</a>&nbsp;with a pretty much flat hierarchy. Our organization is adaptive, getting feedback signals from our users and systems. Right now we organize ourselves by projects, which allow us to build complex features and solve big problems, while staying mutable. As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p><p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

    "content": "WHO IS BEELINE?<br /><br />Beeline is on a mission to help the world have better journeys on two wheels through great navigation software and hardware. Founded in 2015 by Mark and Tom, two friends who wanted to solve getting lost in London on their bikes, Beeline has now grown into a healthy young business with big ambitions to grow (currently in discussions with VC backers to accelerate this further)<br /><br /><br />Beeline’s first product, the Velo, is a beautifully designed device that sits on the bike handlebar and gives navigation guidance to the rider. It was launched on Kickstarter in 2015, and has since sold over 10,000 units. The Moto (the edition for motorcycles) is launching this month and has already taken over 9,000 pre-orders. The first deal to integrate into shared bikes and scooters, or micromobility, has recently been confirmed, with several others in the pipeline – the number of Beeline users will at least triple in the next 9 months. In parallel, we’re building machine learning mapping and routing algorithms dedicated to bikes and scooters, with backing from the European Space Agency. <br /><br />Micromobility is set to be part of the transport solution for our ever more crowded cities. So it’s not only the hottest topic in tech right now but done right, has the potential to have a real impact for good by decongesting and depolluting our cities. <br /><br />We firmly believe that great navigation will be a key enabler to that growth and are very excited to have closed our first deal (the first in the industry). However, we want to be THE navigation provider to this whole industry, not just to one player, and we need someone to lead the charge on that ambition. <br /><br />WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:<br /><br />We’re looking for someone to work directly with the founders of the business to drive our growth into micrombility. The role will be a blend of strategy and sales - becoming an expert in this fast growing industry and building strong relationships with decision makers inside some of the fastest growing tech companies right now as well as the city officials who are trying to keep up with them. You’ll also help shape our product strategy by bringing your thinking to how we offer value to these operators beyond just navigation and cement our position as an invaluable layer in the industry. <br /><br />You’ll have a year or two of commercial experience under your belt and be comfortable with market analysis. More important than your experience will be your ability to think analytically, look at the big strategic picture and most importantly, be fascinated by how the shifts in urban transport could change the shape of cities in the future!<br /><br /><br />IMPACT OF THE WORK:<br />Two wheeled transport is set to play a huge role in the future of our cities as well as a leisure activity, and we think our products will be a key enabler to this growth. Bike use is growing for good reasons – the combined impact of improving citizens’ health and wellbeing as well as the broader environmental benefits make this a no brainer. <br /><br />The trend in micromobility is a huge driver in this change (as well as two wheeled delivery fleets like Deliveroo and Uber Eats and the growth of e-bikes). Providing them with great navigation will both enable them to grow and maximise their positive impact and will likely be the strongest area of growth for our business for the next few years. So you’ll be absolutely pivotal in the success of Beeline as well as making the world a better place. <br /><br /><br />WE CAN OFFER YOU:<br />A competitive salary and generous options (shares)<br />Hands on startup experience working with the founders in a business-critical role <br />A part to play in the future of urban transport<br />A relaxed, supportive and jovial team culture - we aim to take our work seriously without taking ourselves too seriously. Socials in the pub or running round the local park are commonplace! <br />The opportunity to shape the future of this young, growing company<br /><br />YOU CAN OFFER US:<br />1-3 years commercial experience (likely finance or consulting, but not a must)<br />Interest in the future of cities and mobility<br />A rounded skillset: <br />Research skills<br />analytical skills for developing Go-To-Market strategy<br />Strong interpersonal skills for developing relations with cities and operators<br />Creativity, especially for product strategy<br />Comfortable designing and implementing processes - this is a fairly new role in a fast-paced area: adaptability and speed of execution will be crucial <br /><br />",

Our mission is to create a world where anyone with an idea can find space to make it happen. We’ve raised over $20m in funding to date - from tier one investors Balderton and Octopus, as well as some of the world’s largest landlords. Named one of Wired Magazine's ‘100 Hottest Start-Ups’ and The Financial Times’ most ‘Disruptive Companies,’ Appear Here has become the go-to destination to make innovative and creative retail ideas happen across London, Paris and New York.

It's everyone's responsibility to figure out how to optimize everything!<br />- Research the brands' marketing and commercial strategies and creatively find ways to promote the use of short term retail space<br /><br />THE TEAM<br /><br />The Commercial Team is responsible for all aspects of helping brands find the right space for a successful short term rental on the AH platform. You will be working with a high energy, outgoing group who genuinely enjoys the work they do. Our backgrounds are varied, from asset management, and retail to tech-startups. Now we plan to build a billion dollar global property-tech revolution! We'll be listening to music and often stay late or work the odd weekend to hustle and get shit done. The team works hard because we love what we do and the brands we work with and we want you to as well.<br /><br />WHAT YOU CAN EXPECT<br /><br />Plenty of social activities, including board games evening at the office, product team nights out (bowling, darts, mini-golf, and more) and a monthly product team lunch at a local restaurant<br /><br />Hear from amazing speakers within different industries.

This is an opportunity to get to know people from different teams while enjoying dishes from our favourite local restaurants.<br /><br />SOME MORE PERKS<br /><br />- Stock options. We believe everyone should be an owner.<br />- Scale with the business. This role offers the potential to have an incredible career trajectory.<br />- Team socials. From blindfolded martini making to sound baths, we organise quarterly team events that go big on experiences.<br />- Breakfast and snacks throughout the day (including our favourite cheeseboard).<br />- Work with different teams, across different projects.<br />- Best idea wins. Whether you’re an intern or the CTO, if you can make the case for it, we’ll make it happen.<br />- Opportunities and budget for personal learning development.<br />- Great location.

Our first product streamlines recruiting scheduling and coordination, saving teams hundreds of hours a month. We’re just getting started on, and have our sights set on making hiring a great experience for recruiters, hiring managers, and candidates. We’re building the platform to engage these key stakeholders and fix the $200 billion per year hiring industry.   <br>   <br>This is an exceptional opportunity to join a small and fast-growing startup, transforming an industry with powerful and easy to use products customers love. As an early employee you'll have tons of ownership, a big impact on product, a say in our values, and opportunities to tremendously accelerate your career growth.   <br>   <br>We're building a remote team and looking for the best individuals - no matter where you are. All we require is a reliable internet connection and passion for building an amazing company.   <br>   <br>**What We’re Looking For**   <br>   <br>This person is excited about scaling the revenue side of a business. They’re a salesperson first, always customer-focused, thoughtful about creating and scaling processes, and eager to own (and crush) a revenue number.   <br>   <br>Initially, this job will consist primarily of selling (from prospect to close). There will be many other hats to wear – potentially ranging from demand gen, to CS, to support, and even product thinking – and this person is excited to take on new challenges.   <br>   <br>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, and this person is eager to own and be accountable for revenue growth. They’re always looking for ways to add the most value, which may shift and evolve over time.   <br>   <br>**What We Value**   <br>   <br>In addition to ownership and accountability, we believe in: challenging the status quo, having empathy, being direct, being honest, and that nothing is “not my job.”   <br>   <br>**What We Offer**   <br>   <br>* Autonomy, impact, and ownership. As an early employee you’ll shape the product direction and company values.   <br>* Competitive salary and significant equity in a fast growing, early stage startup.   <br>* Remote employment - work where you want, when you want.   <br>* Generous vacation policy - take time whenever you need to recharge. Building a lasting company is a marathon, not a sprint.   <br>* Top-notch healthcare, dental, and vision coverage.   <br>* Life and disability insurance.   <br>* Annual company retreat - helps build camaraderie as a remote team.   <br>* Computer and home office setup - we'll buy anything you need to do your best work.   <br>* Continuing education allowance - learn what you want, when you want.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- USA   <br>  </div> </div>",

We are now a very strong and healthy company and aren't going anywhere for a very long time. In 2011 we were awarded a spot in the Inc 500/5000 coming in at #595. We are profitable, debt-free and have no outside investors... so we always do what we feel is right and this is a stable environoment.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>#2. Opportunity</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Unlike most companies that want to keep your pay as low as they can, we do the opposite! Our goal is to pay you as much as we possibly can because when we do, we know that means you are creating tremendous value for our customers and our business.

Freedom</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We believe that all people deserve to be free... free to make their own choices... free to create their own success... and we strive to create a work environment that not only allows but empowers you to be creative and take risks (well thought out of course). No company politics or popularity contests. We are a team of &quot;producers&quot;... people who are results oriented and believe that each person should be responsible for themselves.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>#5. Great People</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You'd be joining an existing team of superstars, many of whom have been with the company for years. There is virtually no “drama” within the team that most companies have. Everybody is fun, passionate, great at what they do, and willing to help out. If you're that kind of person – you'll fit in perfectly.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>#6. Training and Education</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We invest heavily in our knowledge and skills. As part of our team you'll have access to an enormous library of &quot;how to&quot; and &quot;self improvement&quot; books and courses and we also&nbsp;reimburse our team when they invest in continued education.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>#7.
