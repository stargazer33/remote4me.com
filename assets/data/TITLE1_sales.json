You might need to email or phone someone 6 times before you catch their attention.

Given my last job was in an office of 200 people, I can’t quite express how much that freedom means to me - working whilst I travel to such beautiful, scenic destinations, that before only made up two weeks of my year after I’d saved up some vacation days!</em><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><em><br></em></div><div><em>My passion for travel means the work is always interesting, and my colleagues here are awesome, which makes the day-to-day stuff really enjoyable. They’ve created a real environment for personal development, so when I’ve wanted to take a course to develop certain skills, the team have been more than happy to provide the opportunity for me to do so.”</em></div><div><br></div><div><span>Esmee Fitzgerald – Chief Operating Officer</span></div><div><br></div><div><em>“Working for 10x Travel started as a 10 hour per week role for me. Since then, the amount I’ve learned whilst being part of a growing business has been an unparalleled experience. I can’t quite put into words how much I care for our team and the future of 10x Travel.</em></div><div><br></div><div><em>“Living anywhere you want? Check. Work with not only co-workers, but close friends? Check. Find yourself willingly working in your spare time because of how fun it is? Check.”</em></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>What Will I Be Doing?</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re not a Fortune 500 company, which means you won’t be just another employee in a cubicle.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>As a BDR, you’ll be responsible for managing our sales inboxes, developing the interest of incoming leads, and closing appointment bookings to support our sales process.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You’ll be expected to take control of the existing operation, work with our revenue team to strategize current campaigns and build on current strategies and processes that currently have a ton of unrealized potential.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>If you’re up for the task, you’ll gain yourself new skills, an impressive track record, and a remote job with a great team.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here are examples of tasks you might be working on, day to day:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>Communicating with the lead generation team, who run campaigns to generate new engaged prospects for the sales process</span><br></li><li><span>Emailing back a prospect who has engaged with one of our outreach campaigns</span><br></li><li><span>Updating and managing our Deals CRM, to maintain an accurate picture of our sales pipeline</span><br></li><li><span>Making a call to a potential customer wanting to know more about how we help tour operators grow sales</span><br></li><li><span>Scheduling a strategy session or sales demo between a potential customer and our CEO</span><br></li><li><span>Contributing to our SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) with the things you do and learn on the job</span><br></li><li><span>Collaborating with our team, as part of our team, via Slack</span><br><br></li></ul><div><span>Because we’re a smaller team, you should expect to wear different hats at times as the company continues to grow.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><span>This Position Is Perfect For You If...</span><br></b></div><div></div><div></div><div><b><span></span></b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><span><b>You love to empathise, influence and negotiate.</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We want people that understand the dynamics of influence and persuasion, someone that is knowledgeable (or willing to become knowledgeable) about how to effectively sell and how to work with people. At this level, it’s not enough to be a bulldozer - you must have the innate ability to understand what someone else is going through, and to meet them where they’re at.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You’re creative and can bring in new prospects and opportunities.</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have a ton of processes in place, and our marketing machine is growing all the time, giving us more and more leads coming through our funnels.

Ideally you are self-directed, self-motivated, and don’t need someone to look over your shoulder or hold your hand.

Your wordsmithery needs to be tight, engaging and persuasive - and we’ll ask you to prove it. There should be no doubts about your style and ability to create a solid call to action.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>You’re cool on digital marketing.</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You don’t have to already be a marketing wizard, but if the terms ‘lead magnet’ and ‘email automation’ sound foreign to you, it might be worth reconsidering if you have the foundations this position requires. You’re going to be selling marketing technology, so you’re tech-savvy. Ideally you've read a few books, taken a few courses, or have a fledgling side project of your own that demonstrates your skills.

But this is just the beginning. The commercial property sector hasn’t kept up with the needs of new companies and still works like it did 20 years ago. Our vision is to completely transform the way commercial property is transacted, managed and financed.<br /><br />As a Business Development Associate you will build partnerships with flexible office providers in London and beyond.

    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Customer* *Account* *Manager*<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />As Customer Account Manager you will be responsible for all Switchee’s interactions with our most important Housing Association and Local Authority customers. You will co-ordinate the various touchpoints the Switchee team has with each customer, typically taking ownership from sales and working with our operations, development, marketing and leadership teams. Your ultimate responsibility will be the successful delivery of Switchee services to our large, complex landlord customers with the aim of building long-term (multi-year) commercial relationships based on trust. As we continue to develop our technology an important part of this role will be to develop a deep understanding of both our customers’ and end users needs so that you can input into Switchee product development.<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />* Be the main point of contact with up to 20 Switchee Customers<br />* Co-ordinate and oversee communication with each customer from various parts of the Switchee team; ensure that all deliverables are met on time<br />* Actively seek and grow relationships with all parts of each customer organization, focusing on relevant decision makers<br />* Pro-actively develop a deep understanding of customer and resident needs and how Switchee can either solve them today or develop solutions and/or commercial partnerships to solve them in the future<br />* Monitor and proactively grow the usage of Switchee data insights by all parts of a customer organisation<br />* Suggest and present new product features to our development team, demonstrating a clear understanding of customer value and the need for ROI<br />* Be constantly aware of the need to deliver customer and resident value and to measure and objectively report on this to a range of stakeholders<br />* Be aware that successful implementation of Switchee’s technology does not stop at the delivery of a dashboard, but will ultimately require changed customer behaviour (for example the switch from reactive to pro-active maintenance)<br />* Understand that blockers may be cultural/behavioural as well as technical and thrive in finding solutions to these<br />* Contribute to the growth of Switchee by building long-term commercial relationships with each customer<br /><br /><br />We are a company built on a strong technical foundation. You’ll need to grasp and communicate a technical solution with clients. We also expect you to work closely with Product Development to ensure our product evolves with the customer’s needs at the very centre.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Your* *experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:<br /><br />* At least 3 years’ experience in management consultancy or a similar commercial field<br />* Bachelor’s degree from a top university<br />* Excellent communication and interpersonal skills<br />* Proven ability to develop and implement effective solutions to complex commercial problems<br />* Strong analytical & numeracy skills with complete command of Excel<br />* Fluency with large data sets and an ability to interrogate them for commercial insight<br />* Comfort talking in detail about the technology and processes required to manage large customer accounts<br />* B2B customer facing experience preferred<br />* Experience in a small & quickly expanding business<br />*Knowledge of the housing sector<br />* Experience working with Internet of Things devices<br /><br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We occasionally work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter on our Careers page. ",
