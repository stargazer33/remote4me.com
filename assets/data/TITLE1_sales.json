    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Customer* *Account* *Manager*<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />As Customer Account Manager you will be responsible for all Switchee’s interactions with our most important Housing Association and Local Authority customers. You will co-ordinate the various touchpoints the Switchee team has with each customer, typically taking ownership from sales and working with our operations, development, marketing and leadership teams. Your ultimate responsibility will be the successful delivery of Switchee services to our large, complex landlord customers with the aim of building long-term (multi-year) commercial relationships based on trust. As we continue to develop our technology an important part of this role will be to develop a deep understanding of both our customers’ and end users needs so that you can input into Switchee product development.<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />* Be the main point of contact with up to 20 Switchee Customers<br />* Co-ordinate and oversee communication with each customer from various parts of the Switchee team; ensure that all deliverables are met on time<br />* Actively seek and grow relationships with all parts of each customer organization, focusing on relevant decision makers<br />* Pro-actively develop a deep understanding of customer and resident needs and how Switchee can either solve them today or develop solutions and/or commercial partnerships to solve them in the future<br />* Monitor and proactively grow the usage of Switchee data insights by all parts of a customer organisation<br />* Suggest and present new product features to our development team, demonstrating a clear understanding of customer value and the need for ROI<br />* Be constantly aware of the need to deliver customer and resident value and to measure and objectively report on this to a range of stakeholders<br />* Be aware that successful implementation of Switchee’s technology does not stop at the delivery of a dashboard, but will ultimately require changed customer behaviour (for example the switch from reactive to pro-active maintenance)<br />* Understand that blockers may be cultural/behavioural as well as technical and thrive in finding solutions to these<br />* Contribute to the growth of Switchee by building long-term commercial relationships with each customer<br /><br /><br />We are a company built on a strong technical foundation. You’ll need to grasp and communicate a technical solution with clients. We also expect you to work closely with Product Development to ensure our product evolves with the customer’s needs at the very centre.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Your* *experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:<br /><br />* At least 3 years’ experience in management consultancy or a similar commercial field<br />* Bachelor’s degree from a top university<br />* Excellent communication and interpersonal skills<br />* Proven ability to develop and implement effective solutions to complex commercial problems<br />* Strong analytical & numeracy skills with complete command of Excel<br />* Fluency with large data sets and an ability to interrogate them for commercial insight<br />* Comfort talking in detail about the technology and processes required to manage large customer accounts<br />* B2B customer facing experience preferred<br />* Experience in a small & quickly expanding business<br />*Knowledge of the housing sector<br />* Experience working with Internet of Things devices<br /><br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We occasionally work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter on our Careers page. "

Want to spend tax season in your home office and the slower season working a lighter load from Mexico or Bali or the coast of Spain? Many on our team do just that.</li><li>You get paid directly in proportion to how many tax returns you complete.

We’ve heard our accountants described as “personal tax time hero’s”-we compensate accountants above the standard per return pay for above and beyond customer care</li><li>This opportunity is an ideal fit for people who are happy to work on their own, but don’t want to manage the business logistics like marketing, customer acquisition, billing, customer service, etc</li><li>We’re maniacal about customer care- we expect everyone to have an experience with us that makes them want to go straight out and tell their friends how wonderful Greenback is.

As a Business Sales Specialist, you’ll be the first point of contact for businesses that are considering 1Password. You’ll get the opportunity to help them learn more about the product, understand the best ways their team can use it, and get them started with a trial.<br /><br />What you’ll do<br /><br />- Help new business get started with 1Password, and keep the relationship with them strong.<br />- Proactively report on what potential clients need, and valuable feedback from existing ones, so the product team can improve the product and prioritize the right projects.<br />- Get to know potential customers over discovery calls and demos, and develop a relationship with them.<br />- Close several new deals per month, and generate new leads through outreach.<br />- Try new things: if something isn’t working, try a different tactic, reach out to the product team with questions, and help us reach different types of clients we haven’t encountered before.<br /><br />What you have<br /><br />- Passion for helping people succeed and feel more confident in their work.<br />- Experience with how businesses use software to be more productive and efficient.<br />- Adaptive explanatory skills that get people to understand, not just hear, what you're saying.<br />- A knack for learning things on your own and quickly adapting to new environments. Since 1Password is remote, it’s important to be independent in your research, but also have the humility to ask for help when you aren't sure about something.<br />- Excitement to speak with new people every day and do product demos and presentations with them.<br />- An understanding that conversation is about listening.<br /><br />What you also might have<br /><br />- Experience selling a product to someone – your siblings are lovely, but they don’t count.<br />- A track record with the acronyms SCIM, AD, CLI, SSO, and of course SAAS.<br />- Polyglottism! You could go to France or Germany for a week and jump right in to conversation, or do that from your computer, with a French riviera as your wallpaper.<br />- Personal experience with 1Password.<br /><br />Sounding like a hat you’d wear? Tell us what kind of hat that is."
