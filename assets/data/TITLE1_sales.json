    "content": "<h3>Migration Advisor at <span>Empire Flippers</span></h3><div><span><i></i> Remote</span>         | <span> International </span></div><div>            <p><strong>We’re hiring!</strong></p><p>We are looking to bring on a Migration Advisor to join our operations team.<strong>&nbsp;The role is 100% location independent, allowing you to live anywhere in the world!</strong></p><p>This is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth—and there is no sign of it slowing down.</p><p>In order to keep hitting our goals, including our 2019 goal of $42 million worth of businesses sold, we need to expand our horizons and improve our customer experience to a point that makes us the de-facto standard for buying and selling online businesses. Your work will help propel the industry forward to new levels not seen before.</p><p><strong>So what is a Migration Advisor?</strong></p><p>A Migration Advisor takes a hands-on role, transferring businesses from sellers to buyers in a safe and efficient manner. This can be a stressful time for both parties as they near completion of a potentially life-changing deal. It will be your mission to oversee the asset transfer, keep things moving forward and ensure that everyone is in the loop regarding the migration status.</p><p>You will spend the first couple of months training with our Migration Supervisor, George Sanderson. The first six months will act as your probationary period, at the end of which (all going well) we’ll have you up and running as a fully-fledged Migration Advisor</p><p><strong>What’s the Opportunity?</strong></p><p>Becoming a Migration Advisor makes you a critical part of Empire Flippers. You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world. We will teach you all of our methods for transferring online businesses and you’ll be deep-diving into the backend of all of the businesses we sell.</p><p>You will represent our brand and be the face of Empire Flippers to buyers and sellers at an integral part of the buying and selling process.</p><p>Once a buyer and seller agree on a deal, they’ll be transferred to you to close things out. You’ll be the last piece of the puzzle, helping buyers take over their new business and sellers get paid out.</p><p>After all, when a business is sold, a seller can receive a truly life-changing sum of cash for their business. In some cases, we’ve even paid out a million+ dollars to a seller.</p><p><strong>What’s the Position Like?</strong></p><p>The Migration Advisor role is vital to the success of our company.</p><p>Since this role will have you speaking to buyers and sellers around the world, it can be a bit stressful here and there. You will need to work weird hours sometimes to make sure you can get on the phone with sellers in different time zones. You will also need to be extremely detail-oriented to make sure that processes are followed to a tee.</p><p>Not all buyers and sellers are familiar with the technical aspects of migrating a business; you will need to guide them through the process in a clear and logical manner, ensuring all parties know what’s going on.</p><p>Of course, as in any role, sometimes things may not go quite to plan. It’s at this point that your role becomes most critical; you’ll need to calmly troubleshoot issues and make buyers and sellers feel that we have things in hand.</p><p>You will drive all of our migrations through a multi-step migration process. We are constantly refining this process to make the transfer as seamless as possible and ensure that we are in-line with any updates to program terms and conditions. As you become more seasoned, you will be tasked with improving this migration process.</p><p>We will train you on how to use the various tools we use to migrate businesses. You’ll also be digging into the backend of websites and learning about the various technical aspects of moving a site.</p><p>While you don’t have to be a “techie,” having the capacity to learn the technical nuances of the process is a must.</p><p>You’ll also be exposed to contracts and purchase agreements for multi-million dollar deals. It will be your job to ensure that the migration is conducted in line with the contract.</p><p>Finally, on the rare occasion that some form of renegotiation is required during the migration, you’ll run point on that, helping buyers and sellers to reach a point that works for all parties.</p><p><strong>What Skills Do I Need?</strong></p><p>We believe in hiring people that are a good fit for us culturally. A good fit is actually more important to us than the skill sets since we will teach you everything you need to know.</p><p>While no previous work experience is required, having a background in customer service and/or some kind of technical chops is helpful. Plus, there are some qualities that will go a long way in helping you succeed in this position, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>You need to be detail-oriented.</strong>&nbsp;Migration is a meticulous job. You will be closely following our tried and tested processes and it’s vital that steps are followed closely and accurately.</li><li><strong>You need to be a team player.</strong>&nbsp;The migration team regularly interact with other areas of the business. You’ll be working closely with our sales team to ensure a smooth customer transition when a deal is done. You’ll give feedback to our vetting department on processes tweaks they can make to make your life easier. You need to be good at communicating your thoughts and getting buy-in from colleagues.</li><li><strong>You’re good at defusing problems.</strong>&nbsp;Buying and selling a business is an intimate process. There will almost always be obstacles and challenges for you to help both parties overcome. You’ll need to approach problems in a fair and constructive manner, keeping buyers and sellers calm and giving them confidence that you’ve got their back.</li><li><strong>You’re not afraid of getting on the phone.</strong>&nbsp;The migration position will require you to get on the phone a lot with buyers and sellers. Your phone communication needs to be spot-on and you have to be comfortable making those calls to get all the information we need from the buyer and seller.</li></ul><p><strong>What’s the Lifestyle Like?</strong></p><p><strong>Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits!</strong></p><p>We aren’t going to chain you to a cubicle. You’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best. The choice is yours. While we’re an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not a Fortune 500 company. You won’t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our sellers while also helping to increase the number of high-quality businesses that go live on our marketplace.</p><p>When you first start off, you will be working and training with our Migration Supervisor, George Sanderson. Once we get into 2020, we may ask you to attend a couple of weeks of in-person training at a location to be determined. Of course we will cover the cost of any travel that we require you to do during your probationary period.</p><p>You won’t start off making much money.</p><p>For the first six months, you will be paid $2,000 USD per month during the probation period. In addition to this, you’ll get a housing stipend of $700 USD per month for months 1 through 6. While not a lot, it is enough to have an enjoyable time in many countries around the world and (just to remind you) you’ll be completely location independent! After six months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan. Within 12 months, you can expect to earn $40,000-$46,000 USD per year, and have paid, international healthcare coverage.</p><p>This amount is more than enough to live a very nice lifestyle in Asia or almost anywhere in the world (within reason).</p><p><strong>Love It. What’s the Catch?</strong></p><p>While our lifestyle is pretty great, this isn’t a gap year experience to go travel the world.</p><p>We are looking for career-minded people that can make a positive impact on our business. Sure, sometimes we really do work by the pool, but we also work hard.</p><p>There will be days when you clock in 12 hours. There will also be days when you are up at all sorts of strange hours dealing with our sellers who live anywhere from the U.S. and U.K. to Eastern Europe and Asia.</p><p>While you might take a long break during the middle of the day, you might also find yourself burning the midnight oil as you hop onto a call to get a buyer or seller through the last hump of the migration process.</p><p>A lot of people love the idea of finding a job that allows them to travel the world and get a different job later back home. That is not this job.</p><p>We want you for the long-haul. We want you to grow with us and turn this position into a prosperous career.</p><p><strong>Details to Keep in Mind</strong></p><ul><li>Remember, we’re not going to throw you into the fire from day one.</li><li>When you first come on board, you’re going to learn about our company. We will do a deep dive into how our processes and systems work, set you up in the backend, and teach you about each department within the business.</li><li>We’ll start you off with low-level tasks. As you get better acquainted with our business, we will gradually build up your workload, get you comfortable with routine migrations, and then start having you take on more ambitious projects.</li><li>We will review every application that comes our way. If we believe you’re a good fit for us, we will reach out to set up an interview. Typically, there are two rounds of interviews before we make a decision.</li><li>If you believe you’re a good fit, you have until October 13, 2019 to apply.</li><li>A background check is required before employment.</li></ul><p><strong>How Do I Apply?</strong></p><p>Here is the sequence of events we use when hiring our new Migration Advisor:</p><ul><li>You record a YouTube video* explaining who you are and why you’re a good fit for the position, fill out an application by clicking the link below, and submit it ASAP by October 13, 2019.</li><li>We review submissions and schedule first interviews.</li><li>Once second interviews are done, a final decision is made.</li><li>The chosen candidate will be announced by the end of October.</li><li>The chosen candidate will start with the company on December 2nd, 2019.</li></ul><p><strong>YouTube Video Requirements:</strong></p><p>We will only accept submissions that include a YouTube URL. Please leave the video “unlisted” in preferences and share the link with us. The quality of the video doesn’t matter, and there are no bonus points for editing. We just want (up to) three minutes of you explaining and answering the following questions (based on your previous experience):</p><ol><li>Describe how your&nbsp;<strong>past experiences</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>current skill set</strong>&nbsp;will allow you to succeed working as a Migration Advisor.</li><li>Tell us one thing about you that sets you apart from the other candidates applying for this role.</li></ol><p>If you’re thinking about applying but are worried you might not have enough (insert excuse here) — don’t worry.

Working for a variety of global clients from different industries, Strange Thoughts&rsquo; work is never the same, making TV ads for a gaming retailer one moment and an internet connected pair of trainers for a sportswear brand the next. Our goal, since 2014, has been to deliver amazing, tech-led, creative for bold brands. We have a unique model of crowd-sourcing expertise from the cutting edge of technology and creative through a network which allows very different minds to co-create, a process we like to call Radical Collaboration. We believe that innovation and creativity cannot thrive in a contained environment, so draw upon our global network for idea generation, with incredible results.

This additional income is generated by customers paying to use their spaces. Our Customer Sales Team are responsible for working with new customers. Our customers our community groups ranging from all types of sports, dance and wellness groups to religious gatherings, tutor groups and one off events.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are looking for a new member to join our Customer Sales Team to outreach to new customers in the local areas near our partner schools.</p><br /><p><strong>The Role - How</strong></p><br /><p><em>Key responsibilities:</em></p><br /><p>You will be responsible for qualifying new leads for our partner schools which will be passed to our Community Partnership Executive who will finalise the details and confirm the booking with the new customer.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Your role will therefore include:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Getting to grips with new partner schools, their spaces and the surrounding area&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Creating lists of potential customers to reach out to&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Phone, email and social media outreach to potential customers&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Having successful conversations with new potential customers about their current space and selling them our spaces&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Following up with positive calls over email&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Conducting qualifying calls to confirm a lead is hot&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Tracking your activities and making detailed notes in our CRM system&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Passing hot deals on to our Community Partnership Executive with enough details that they are able to close the sale&nbsp;</li><br /></ul><br /><p>You will also partake in weekly sales meeting, training and brainstorming sessions.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong><em>What we want from you:</em></strong></p><br /><p><em>For applicants for this role we are looking for:</em></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Some experience working with customers (in a sales or customer service role)&nbsp;</li><br /><li>An interest in selling&nbsp;</li><br /><li>A willingness to pick up the phone and talk to lots of new people&nbsp;</li><br /><li>A self-starter - someone who can work independently and is happy to try new ideas</li><br /><li>Good written and verbal skills&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Resilience - sometimes people are going to say no!</li><br /><li>A motivation to hit targets&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Some technical aptitude in order to use our CRM system, email and track results&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Someone who is happy to give and receive feedback to colleagues&nbsp;</li><br /><li>An eagerness to work in a start-up environment where we will constantly be trying to improve processes</li><br /></ul><br /><p>&nbsp;<strong>School Space - Why</strong></p><br /><p>Like it or not, funding plays a critical role in a schools ability to deliver a great education, and we are unfortunately facing a funding cut crisis in the UK, the scale of which hasn&rsquo;t been seen since WW2. This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours. Across the UK, connected communities are simply not happening.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>This is where School Space comes in.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - How</strong></p><br /><p>Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays. We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the center of a thriving community.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - Team</strong></p><br /><p>Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 8 years. We started the 19/20 academic year with 41 partner schools who, over the past 3 years we have raised almost &pound;1 million for. The company has also been nominated for numerous awards including Jemma and James being recognised in Forbes&rsquo; &lsquo;30 Under 30&rsquo; list and School Space being named one of Escape the Cities Top 100 employers.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our team are committed to the social mission of our company and working to help the business grow (and help more schools!). We hold daily stand ups to keep everyone in the loop and &lsquo;Party Calls&rsquo; at 5pm every Friday to share success from the week. We hold a monthly social every month to get the whole team together (particularly those who work remotely!). Activities have included going to cricket matches, punting in Oxford, bowling and cocktail making.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>The team come from a range of backgrounds and experience with some recent grads and some industry veterans. In the mix we have a keen martial artist, a man who can name and rate every restaurant within a 20 min walk of our office, Oxbridge graduates, an Olympic torch bearer and a woman who once ran a marathon on a bet.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</strong></p>",

We provide 750 companies worldwide with a feedback platform so their employees can learn from each other and grow professionally. SoundCloud, Zapier, Strava, Duolingo and many more use our SAAS solution company-wide — from the intern to the CEO.<br><br></div><div>In an continuing effort to expand our customer base, we are looking for a business developer to assist us in working with prospects and customers alike.<br><br></div><div>This position is remote – you can work anywhere in the US EST timezone.<br><br></div><h3>What you’ll do</h3><div>We’re a <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/' rel='nofollow'>company of 35 people in Berlin and the US</a> and looking to grow. Our product is a performance feedback platform rolled out company-wide from the intern to the CEO. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives, organize one-on-one meetings, and to praise each other for a job well done.<br><br></div><div>We’ve got a <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/customer-team/' rel='nofollow'>very strong customer team</a> in place, and want to get even better at showcasing our product, working with prospects, and ensuring a smooth roll-out. We’re not a super salesy organization, but are looking to increase the awareness of our tool. So if you are interested in making a difference in a fast-paced and international environment, this could be for you!<br><br></div><div>The job will focus on three major aspects:</div><ul><li><strong>Help convert leads into happy customers:</strong> Our pipeline is full so you’ll be busy. Our initial discovery demos with prospects are an essential gauge to determine whether our solution is the right fit for their needs. You’ll learn to understand the mindset of the HR professional, be a great listener, and never over-promise. This is a people business and our job is more guide than pitch.</li><li><strong>Generate new leads:</strong> The pipeline could always be fuller! You’ll work closely with Marketing as they nurture leads upstream, actively looking for ways to connect the dots within our inbound strategy. You’ll occasionally attend events we sponsor, you’llinnovate on our existing processes, workflows and sales collateral, and you’ll help with competitor analysis to improve our targeting.</li><li><strong>Ensure customers are happy beyond the purchase:</strong> Our dedicated customer success and support teams are in charge of retention and happiness. You’ll help by making the onboarding handover smooth, and offer semi-regular check-ins to ensure we close our feedback loop.</li><li><strong>And more!</strong> We love people who are well-rounded and have many strengths. Sales, Success, &amp; Support work very closely with each other – so you can expect to spend some time in another team learning about the product and space too. Beyond the core responsibilities you’re welcome to grow into other areas, and are heavily encouraged to help shape the direction of the product! If you want to spread your wings, then we can help you fly.</li></ul><div><br></div><h3>Who we’re looking for</h3><div>You don’t have to tick all the boxes, but we are looking for someone quite special that embodies most of the following:</div><ul><li>You have at least 2 years B2B sales experience.</li><li>You are dynamic, think outside the box, and go the extra mile.</li><li>You have business acumen. You don’t need to have an MBA, but you should be able to understand how companies work and be able to identify what an opportunity or a company on an upwards trajectory looks like.</li><li>You’re keen in learning about the HR tech market, what makes for great workplaces, what motivates people, and how the workplace of the future might look like. We can’t do our jobs well unless we really know our customers and their needs.</li><li>You’re a go-getter. If you think something isn’t working and could be improved, fix it! You strive to be the change you seek and like to experiment.</li><li>You are interested in SaaS and the online world in general, and you’re tech savvy and a quick learner.</li><li>You speak English fluently and write well and concisely</li><li>Also, you should be comfortable working remotely. Most Small Improvers work from the HQ in Berlin, including part of the Sales team. We won’t ask you to be available super early to be able to join cross-timezones calls, but you need to be comfortable being flexible to a certain extend (and Berlin people are flexible too, of course). Also, we all make a concerted effort to stay connected and overshare as much as possible, but working without the regular “water cooler talks” is not for everyone. You’ll always need to find new ways to reengage and connect with HQ people, and to be comfortable with managing your own time and workload.</li></ul><div><br></div><h3>More reasons to work at SI</h3><ul><li>We’re international: We’re based in Berlin and sell mainly to the US, Australia and the UK. Our staff of 35 hails from 16 countries (all our written communication is in English)</li><li>We’re self-funded, transparent and profitable, and our customer base is growing.</li><li>We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales.</li><li>There are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!</li><li>You’re invited to visit our Berlin head office for three weeks once a year and we cover the costs. Take an <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/office-tour/' rel='nofollow'>office tour</a>.</li><li>And we love to travel! <a href='https://vimeo.com/293382390' rel='nofollow'>Take a look at our last company trip</a>.</li></ul></div>",

Al this is easily managed in an online portal for customers</p><br /><p>We already have over 30 clients despite launching in just April 2018, many of which are amongst the top fleets in the UK.

This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p><br /><p>Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours. Across the UK, connected communities are simply not happening. This is where School Space comes in.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - How</strong></p><br /><p>Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays. We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the center of a thriving community.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - Team</strong></p><br /><p>Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 7 years, and recent success includes investment raises, 36 partner schools, over half a million generated for them. We&rsquo;ve been on the Techstars 2018 Cohort, been nominated for Social Enterprise UK&rsquo;s Social Enterprise of the Year,&nbsp; and picked up a few awards and amazing networks along the way. Our team are committed to the nth degree and full of the belief that social business is the model of the future. We have endless determination to see School Space grow fast and well, scaling our impact across the UK and beyond. In the mix we have Oxbridge graduates, marathon runners, a pilot, industry veterans, an Olympic torch bearer and a woman who once ran a marathon on a bet.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>The Role - Why</strong></p><br /><p>The more community users (those that hire our school spaces) the greater impact we can have - and we need to hire an amazing, motivated person to find and engage them. With every booking you secure, you will make an impact on the education sector (and some commission too..).</p><br /><p><strong>The Role - How</strong></p><br /><p>Key responsibilities include:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Find and qualify new leads through web searches, local meetups, classified ads and community networks</li><br /><li>Create target lists and prioritise activities</li><br /><li>Identify the key stakeholders, and organise meetings through calls, emails, and social media&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Build relationships with new prospects over the phone or email and demonstrate the value of School Space to them from the first interaction</li><br /><li>Match prospective customers with the best spaces for them and qualify the opportunity including identifying any key blockers</li><br /><li>Collaborate with Sales Executives and the Director/co-founder you report into, to convey details of the opportunities and arrange discovery calls or meetings with the prospective leads.</li><br /><li>Achieve or exceed monthly quotas of qualified opportunities and closed business&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Suggest innovative ways to catch customers&rsquo; attention and obtain new meetings with them.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What we want from you:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Hustle.</li><br /><li>A track record of high achievement, going above and beyond&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Resilience - the ability to persist, overcome objections and engage stakeholders effectively</li><br /><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Previous successful sales experience OR a strong desire to begin a sales career&nbsp;</li><br /><li>The ability and desire to work in a fast-paced, challenging environment with peers who challenge you to constantly improve</li><br /><li>Natural curiosity with sincere empathy for customers - a people person.</li><br /><li>The technical aptitude to master our CRM tools</li><br /><li>A motivation to hit targets and earn commission</li><br /><li>An eagerness to take on more responsibility, and you thrive on change - we are a start up and that means things are fast moving.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

    "content": "<p>We're hiring employees number 4 and 5to work on business development / sales (whichever word doesn’t make youcringe!) and new clients. We are a brand new Cambridge-based commercial teamwho has just raised Seed, and we’re growing our user base 10-20% month overmonth. You’ll be a Commercial Account Executive, working with the ChiefCommercial Officer and sometimes (which means “often”) directly with the CEO.You’ll help new clients understand the business and our technology, and how itsolves the problems they’re having with personal data, general innovation, andAI. Come on board if you want to pull weight at one of the most interestingyoung technology companies to come out of Cambridge.<br></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Specific Duties and Responsibilities</b></p><p><i>Commercial Account Management</i></p><p>We’re a brand new technology, and our clients need time and support to understand what we can do for their business (which is a lot). You’ll help them understand everything we do, and how it helps them with their technology innovation, digital transformation, personal data, and AI.</p><p><i>Sales</i></p><p>We support and work with real big global clients and real small local startups, and your job is to offer something to all of them. You’ll build out an exceptional network doing this job, and if you’re amazing at the communications and followup bits of account management you’ll have a huge impact here. Everyone will want to be your friend, because you’re going to be friends with all our clients!</p><p><i>Growth Sprints</i></p><p>DataSwift is developing a growth and marketing engine targeting developers, startups, and other fast-growing businesses alongside (and during) your work. You’re going to help with this as well - you will contribute weekly to the business development and marketing sprints, working with the CCO (me) to develop a scalable engine of growth. If Eric Ries said it, we’re doing it.</p><p><i>External Comms</i></p><p>You will be the first point of contact for all of our new and existing business. We’re depending on you.</p><p><i>Reporting and Insights</i></p><p>We track our business development accurately and do a great job refining our pipelines down until they sing sea shanties. You’re going to be the ultimate authority on exactly how much business we’re doing and how we could be doing more.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Skills, Qualifications and Experiences:</b></p><p><i>Communications – </i>you are joining an elite (*buffs nails*) team of early business-side startuppers, working on the hardest job in startups: early-stage growth. Good, no, great communication is essential. If you’ve never worked in startups before that’s ok too - we’ll teach you everything you need to know. Which reminds me…</p><p><i>Learning - </i>very, very few people have elite-level experience in high-growth startups. If you do (awesome, come work with us!!) you know that learning is a huge part of the job. If you don’t this is going to be a place where you can pick up hundreds if not thousands of new skills, and really stretch your abilities. Sound fun?</p><p><i>Customer relations – </i>you can talk to anyone; no, not in that fake, salesman-y sort of way but in the way that suits you. You are diligent about communications, you want to deeply help and understand your customers, and you care. You got this.</p><p><i>Time management – </i>we have too much to do, and you will too. If you can work well under pressure and manage your time and tasks efficiently, you’re going to love it here.</p><p><i>Executive support – </i>you know everything there is to know about being helpful. You probably really like being helpful. I mean, being helpful is awesome, why wouldn’t you?</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>What’s in it for you:</b></p><p>This is an entry-level role paying £20,000-30,000 a year, and you’ll earn equity as well. You’ll work in a fast-paced environment with a lot of flexibility, and you can more or less work as remotely as you like. You’ll get some expenses covered, you’ll have lot’s of opportunities for advancement, and you’ll be joining us right after we’ve raised Seed (and before Series A), which is almost the perfect time to join a young Startup. You’ll have a lot of responsibilities and you’ll learn a ton.</p><p><b>The pitch from us:</b></p><p>This is a chance to work on the most important problems in tech: data problems. You can fix Cambridge Analytica and help pioneer the future of the digital economy.</p><p>You'll work with a young, driven growth team with a range of skills. You can also help shape that team, as we're still small and are building our internal culture.</p><p>We have good flexibility. We can foster remote working and we have family-friendly setups and understanding for our teams. We're very international as well, with team members from Canada, the UK, Malaysia, Greece, and Germany.</p><p>Things are going to move quickly here, and your personal development is one of our big focuses, and so is the development of our team as we onboard our new customers. You're joining the company right at Seed stage - so stable enough to be responsible, but young enough for there still to be lots of responsibility to go around.</p><p>We cultivate a culture of open-mindedness and flexibility with discipline and hard work. On top of a competitive salary, you get financial perks like equity, and the responsibilities of leadership. We're building a representative team and you'll work under one of the highest-paid female academics and CEOs in the UK. Hope you can join us.</p><p>Oh, and I'm Jonathan, by the way. Great to meet you.</p>",

You believe that the only way to grow is to be independent and always be learning. Prior experience at a startup or SaaS company is highly preferred.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You genuinely enjoy helping and talking to people. You realize that sales is about building authentic long-term relationships. You must have prior sales or SDR experience that shows this.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your are creative and tech savvy. You realize that your prospects get flooded with cold emails and you look for ways to stand out from the crowd. Experience with outbound software (Outreach.io, Salesloft) and other sales tech (GoVideo, Cirrus Insight) is a big plus!</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You focus on quality over quantity. You believe that it is better to write ten high quality cold emails versus one hundred cookie-cutter emails.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You don’t make excuses.

We are currently a hybrid-remote team of 12 people that is spread over 6 different cities worldwide.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re fully independent and bootstrapped with $0 raised from VCs or investors. We did this so we can focus on the two things that matter the most: our customers and our team.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Every customer we have today was sourced using our own product (Prospect) or via word-of-mouth. Our sales team is very small (&lt; 3 people) and you will work very closely with our CEO on a regular basis.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND PERKS</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>The salary for this role is $80,000 Canadian dollars (OTE; $40,000 base, $40,000 commission). This will be adjusted as you start doing your own meetings and start closing deals.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You can choose to work from our Kitchener-Waterloo office, entirely remote (any country), or a blend of both. You are encouraged to work where you perform best.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We believe that you should have good equipment to do your work and we give a laptop of your choice once you’re up and running.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We give ample time off. Everyone gets 4 weeks paid-time-off. Additionally, we work four-day workweeks every July and August. We also offer a generous vacation allowance.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>If you are authorized to work in Canada, we will also give you health benefits under our company HSA. If you decide to work from the office, you will also get daily catered lunches.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>WHAT’S NEXT</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>If this sounds like something you would like to be a part of, we would love to hear from you!</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We usually get hundreds of job applicants and we read through every single one of them. We highly recommend applying with a good cover letter if you would like to stand out.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Within two weeks of applying, you will hear from us if you’ve made it to the next stage which will be a quick culture screening. You will then have an hour long call with the team. After that, you will proceed to the final stage of interviews which will be specific to the role and then to the final offer.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div></div>",

    "content": "Most experienced SaaS sales professionals have participated in a sales training programme at one point in their careers. Famous sales methodologies like MEDDIC, Value Selling and others, have been adopted by thousands of software organisations throughout the world to help sales teams ultimately deliver better results, sometimes to good effect.<br /><br />What often happens though, is that salespeople have forgettable experiences with these programmes and whilst they may show initial enthusiasm, it is common to see a new methodology rigorously followed for a few months, before disappearing out of sight and mind forever.<br /><br />Todays selection of programmes offer valuable learning, but the delivery of programmes can be a poor experience. Trainings are often much too generic, and almost never align with the unique challenges SaaS businesses face, such as preparing for rapid scale, or future acquisition.<br /><br />SAASco seeks a successful SaaS salesperson to help build a better way for companies to implement successful sales methodologies, process and training, by compiling unique programmes which align with business goals and revolutionise the sales function.<br /><br />The perfect co-founder will have experienced great success working with hyper-growth SaaS businesses in a sales capacity - experience of closing six figure deals is essential but seven figure deals will be preferable.<br /><br />Remote working is welcomed but US or UK based persons would be preferred for proximity to SaaS hubs.",
