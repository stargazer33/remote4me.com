    "content": "Most experienced SaaS sales professionals have participated in a sales training programme at one point in their careers. Famous sales methodologies like MEDDIC, Value Selling and others, have been adopted by thousands of software organisations throughout the world to help sales teams ultimately deliver better results, sometimes to good effect.<br /><br />What often happens though, is that salespeople have forgettable experiences with these programmes and whilst they may show initial enthusiasm, it is common to see a new methodology rigorously followed for a few months, before disappearing out of sight and mind forever.<br /><br />Todays selection of programmes offer valuable learning, but the delivery of programmes can be a poor experience. Trainings are often much too generic, and almost never align with the unique challenges SaaS businesses face, such as preparing for rapid scale, or future acquisition.<br /><br />SAASco seeks a successful SaaS salesperson to help build a better way for companies to implement successful sales methodologies, process and training, by compiling unique programmes which align with business goals and revolutionise the sales function.<br /><br />The perfect co-founder will have experienced great success working with hyper-growth SaaS businesses in a sales capacity - experience of closing six figure deals is essential but seven figure deals will be preferable.<br /><br />Remote working is welcomed but US or UK based persons would be preferred for proximity to SaaS hubs.",

    "content": "Hi. I’m Eric and I’m the Co-Founder &amp; CTO of Itoma 3D Tech. We are a start-up based in Hatfield / North London, UK.\n<br>\n<br>Our Vision is to simplify 3D Modelling &amp; 3D Printing using AI, Robotics &amp; Voice technology to make it at our customer's voice command.\n<br>Big Vision starts with a single niche to make us investable, find a market fit &amp; develop a product so we currently focus on 3D Modelling &amp; 3D Printing for B2B Architecture &amp; Construction and that's the market where we currently develop co-venturing &amp; sales relationships.\n<br>\n<br>This is our product roadmap to get us there: \n<br>itoma.co.uk/3dme-product-demo/ \n<br>And that’s our long-term strategy:\n<br>itoma.co.uk/our-3d-tech-strategy/\n<br>\n<br>We have pre-seed funding, well defined plan &amp; an amazing tech team to get an edge, MVP, first sales, a couple of Letters of Intent, cooperation for innovation with 2 universities, received SEIS &amp; EIS status for UK investors and currently focus on fundraising &amp; sales.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>WHAT:\n<br>We are looking for a person with some sales experience &amp; drive to join our start-up on a flexible, part-time basis for equity with sales commission:\n<br>1. To finish the development of our sales strategy (Mostly B2B to architecture &amp; construction).\n<br>2. Continue contacting leads &amp; develop customer sales strategy.\n<br>3. Get Letters of Intent &amp; sales to help us get funding &amp; develop the product line.\n<br>\n<br>Then once we develop sufficiently – to join us full or part-time as a salaried person or continue as an advisor:\n<br>1. To move to contract stages with B2B sales.\n<br>2. Develop relationships with new customers.\n<br>3. And build the proper sales team to eventually manage.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>PROPOSED IMPACT JD:\n<br>1 month - pick up relationship with existing companies that we met &amp; contacted.\n<br>2 months - 1 Letter of Intent\n<br>3 months - first sales\n<br>6 months - 1 co-venturing relationship for market fit &amp; product development. Multiple sales.\n<br>12 months - 2 co-venturing relationships (in total). Sales volumes. Thinking of international possibilities (initially - for prestige to investors for Series A).\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>WHO:\n<br>We trust that will suit best someone who is already working part-time in sales and looks for the long term but a flexible game with an innovative start-up.\n<br>Or someone who recently retired or semi-retired and wants to get back in the game (even constant holidays get finally boring after ~1 year of constant travelling – we have an example in our team already!).\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>YOUR MOTIVATION:\n<br>Your motivation is more important than a perfect experience. We offer flexibility (eg. home based &amp; set your own hours as long as we all get to our impact goals), support and a product that can take practically any shape, size &amp; colour in exchange (to make it this much easier) \n<br>The possibility to shape the Future is a bonus!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>You know what they say – set the expectations early but don’t scare everyone off! \n<br>In other words – we are all people so even if you fulfil some of this stuff but eg. have a passion for 3D Printing, Architecture &amp; Construction &amp; innovative tech – then give us a shout. \n<br>But most of all - we are a start-up so the main thing is that we are in it together &amp; like us here - you do not expect salary straight away because we simply can't afford it yet but we will offer commission on sales with equity, which can especially pay off if you've got good contacts in Construction &amp; Architecture industry.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Best, \n<br>Eric\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>PS Good start is crucial – we sign a mutual NDA with all people who work with us to have a good &amp; open conversation &amp; then have a couple of conversations to build the big picture of where we are going as well as sales plan.",

We leverage that expertise, our processes, and the most cutting edge technology to generate outbound sales opportunities on behalf of our clients. The Account Manager role acts as the interface between our internal teams and the client. You, along with a Senior Account Manager, will need to have the confidence and experience to act as an “expert” in all situations that may arise. If you LOVE sales but want to expand your sales skills beyond the front line, this is a role for you.</p>\n <p>Coordinate and manage projects in conjunction with Senior Account Manager (SAM)</p>\n <p>Each Senior Account Manager may be running 15+ individual accounts.

That’s not us. You will be empowered and expected to critically analyze our processes and our performance to find efficiencies and better ways of doing things so that we can continue to drive exceptional results for our clients. This might include identifying and elevating process issues, poor client campaign performance, or how we’re communicating internally between teams.

Our organization is adaptive, getting feedback signals from our users and systems. Right now we organize ourselves by projects, which allow us to build complex features and solve big problems, while staying mutable. As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>\n <p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p>\n <p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p>\n <p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Work remotely</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible working hours</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Equipment of your choice</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span> </li> \n</ul>",

    "content": "WHO IS BEELINE?\n<br>\n<br>Beeline is on a mission to help the world have better journeys on two wheels through great navigation software and hardware. Founded in 2015 by Mark and Tom, two friends who wanted to solve getting lost in London on their bikes, Beeline has now grown into a healthy young business with big ambitions to grow (currently in discussions with VC backers to accelerate this further)\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Beeline’s first product, the Velo, is a beautifully designed device that sits on the bike handlebar and gives navigation guidance to the rider. It was launched on Kickstarter in 2015, and has since sold over 10,000 units. The Moto (the edition for motorcycles) is launching this month and has already taken over 9,000 pre-orders. The first deal to integrate into shared bikes and scooters, or micromobility, has recently been confirmed, with several others in the pipeline – the number of Beeline users will at least triple in the next 9 months. In parallel, we’re building machine learning mapping and routing algorithms dedicated to bikes and scooters, with backing from the European Space Agency. \n<br>\n<br>Micromobility is set to be part of the transport solution for our ever more crowded cities. So it’s not only the hottest topic in tech right now but done right, has the potential to have a real impact for good by decongesting and depolluting our cities. \n<br>\n<br>We firmly believe that great navigation will be a key enabler to that growth and are very excited to have closed our first deal (the first in the industry). However, we want to be THE navigation provider to this whole industry, not just to one player, and we need someone to lead the charge on that ambition. \n<br>\n<br>WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:\n<br>\n<br>We’re looking for someone to work directly with the founders of the business to drive our growth into micrombility. The role will be a blend of strategy and sales - becoming an expert in this fast growing industry and building strong relationships with decision makers inside some of the fastest growing tech companies right now as well as the city officials who are trying to keep up with them. You’ll also help shape our product strategy by bringing your thinking to how we offer value to these operators beyond just navigation and cement our position as an invaluable layer in the industry. \n<br>\n<br>You’ll have a year or two of commercial experience under your belt and be comfortable with market analysis. More important than your experience will be your ability to think analytically, look at the big strategic picture and most importantly, be fascinated by how the shifts in urban transport could change the shape of cities in the future!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>IMPACT OF THE WORK:\n<br>Two wheeled transport is set to play a huge role in the future of our cities as well as a leisure activity, and we think our products will be a key enabler to this growth. Bike use is growing for good reasons – the combined impact of improving citizens’ health and wellbeing as well as the broader environmental benefits make this a no brainer. \n<br>\n<br>The trend in micromobility is a huge driver in this change (as well as two wheeled delivery fleets like Deliveroo and Uber Eats and the growth of e-bikes).

You will work on multiple client projects in support of our broader team to contribute to and grow. \n  <br> \n  <br>The Sales Assistant will report directly to the Commercial Director and will be responsible for taking on a variety of tasks that allow for the successful completion of planned marketing programs. \n  <br> \n  <br>You will collaborate across the organization, and own key agency relationships, developing ideas and strategies, as it relates to the Company’s general growth. \n  <br> \n  <br>**What we offer you** \n  <br> \n  <br>Career progression is based on your ability to deliver and drive ideas and difference for both the client and the company, not your ability to play politics or by the cut of your suit (in fact, we have a no suit policy). \n  <br> \n  <br>A highly collaborative remote working environment, where teamwork is championed, and ideas shared - you will be someone who is unafraid of contributing ideas and happy to work as part of a remote team and in exchange for your hard work, we can give you a unique opportunity to shape and contribute to a flourishing business to achieve your lifestyle goals. \n  <br> \n  <br>We even fly the qualifying team members each year to our awesome TrustEDConf event. The last one was in October in Borneo. \n  <br>An important point that is often overlooked: you will be truly part of a team. For most remote workers, you can easily feel isolated from what's happening in the business. We take good care of our teammates. So much so that a person who joined our team late November told us recently that she has felt more part of a team, than when she was working in an office. \n  <br> \n  <br>Don't take our word for it. Check what our teammates are saying on Glassdoor (yep, 2 reviews are not great, but most are). \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br># Responsibilities \n  <br> * Manage, coordinate and motivate company sales and marketing functions to achieve required sales targets. \n  <br>* Conduct client proposals and follow-ups \n  <br>* Update and nurture the internal database \n  <br>* Undertake daily administrative tasks to ensure the functionality of the department \n  <br>* Prepare and deliver presentations \n  <br>* Liaise with the team in gathering recommendations and scope of work \n  <br>* Craft templates \n  <br>* Communicate directly with clients and encourage trusting relationships \n  <br>* Research and analyze market conditions and opportunities \n  <br> \n  <br># Requirements \n  <br>Ideal candidate \n  <br> \n  <br>* 1-3 years of Sales experience \n  <br>* Demonstrable ability to multi-task \n  <br>* Impeccable communication and people skills \n  <br>* Good knowledge of Google Suite \n  <br>* A clear understanding of how social media campaigns can be used in different parts of the funnel \n  <br>* Detail oriented &amp; organized \n  <br>* Strong analytical skills \n  <br>* Can work under pressure with strict deadlines \n  <br> \n  <br>Attributes and behaviors we love to see \n  <br> \n  <br>* A can-do attitude \n  <br>* Ownership of your work \n  <br>* Inquisitive \n  <br>* Analytical \n  <br>* Creative in context \n  <br>* Results orientated \n  <br>* Collegiate and supportive \n  <br>* A sense of humor \n  <br> \n  <br>#Location \n  <br>- Worldwide \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

Our first product streamlines recruiting scheduling and coordination, saving teams hundreds of hours a month. We’re just getting started on, and have our sights set on making hiring a great experience for recruiters, hiring managers, and candidates. We’re building the platform to engage these key stakeholders and fix the $200 billion per year hiring industry. \n  <br> \n  <br>This is an exceptional opportunity to join a small and fast-growing startup, transforming an industry with powerful and easy to use products customers love. As an early employee you'll have tons of ownership, a big impact on product, a say in our values, and opportunities to tremendously accelerate your career growth. \n  <br> \n  <br>We're building a remote team and looking for the best individuals - no matter where you are. All we require is a reliable internet connection and passion for building an amazing company. \n  <br> \n  <br>**What We’re Looking For** \n  <br> \n  <br>This person is excited about scaling the revenue side of a business. They’re a salesperson first, always customer-focused, thoughtful about creating and scaling processes, and eager to own (and crush) a revenue number. \n  <br> \n  <br>Initially, this job will consist primarily of selling (from prospect to close). There will be many other hats to wear – potentially ranging from demand gen, to CS, to support, and even product thinking – and this person is excited to take on new challenges. \n  <br> \n  <br>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, and this person is eager to own and be accountable for revenue growth. They’re always looking for ways to add the most value, which may shift and evolve over time. \n  <br> \n  <br>**What We Value** \n  <br> \n  <br>In addition to ownership and accountability, we believe in: challenging the status quo, having empathy, being direct, being honest, and that nothing is “not my job.” \n  <br> \n  <br>**What We Offer** \n  <br> \n  <br>* Autonomy, impact, and ownership. As an early employee you’ll shape the product direction and company values. \n  <br>* Competitive salary and significant equity in a fast growing, early stage startup. \n  <br>* Remote employment - work where you want, when you want. \n  <br>* Generous vacation policy - take time whenever you need to recharge. Building a lasting company is a marathon, not a sprint. \n  <br>* Top-notch healthcare, dental, and vision coverage. \n  <br>* Life and disability insurance. \n  <br>* Annual company retreat - helps build camaraderie as a remote team. \n  <br>* Computer and home office setup - we'll buy anything you need to do your best work. \n  <br>* Continuing education allowance - learn what you want, when you want. \n  <br> \n  <br>#Location \n  <br>- USA \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",
