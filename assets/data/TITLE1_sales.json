    "content": "WHO IS BEELINE?<br /><br />Beeline is on a mission to help the world have better journeys on two wheels through great navigation software and hardware. Founded in 2015 by Mark and Tom, two friends who wanted to solve getting lost in London on their bikes, Beeline has now grown into a healthy young business with big ambitions to grow (currently in discussions with VC backers to accelerate this further)<br /><br /><br />Beeline’s first product, the Velo, is a beautifully designed device that sits on the bike handlebar and gives navigation guidance to the rider. It was launched on Kickstarter in 2015, and has since sold over 10,000 units. The Moto (the edition for motorcycles) is launching this month and has already taken over 9,000 pre-orders. The first deal to integrate into shared bikes and scooters, or micromobility, has recently been confirmed, with several others in the pipeline – the number of Beeline users will at least triple in the next 9 months. In parallel, we’re building machine learning mapping and routing algorithms dedicated to bikes and scooters, with backing from the European Space Agency. <br /><br />Micromobility is set to be part of the transport solution for our ever more crowded cities. So it’s not only the hottest topic in tech right now but done right, has the potential to have a real impact for good by decongesting and depolluting our cities. <br /><br />We firmly believe that great navigation will be a key enabler to that growth and are very excited to have closed our first deal (the first in the industry). However, we want to be THE navigation provider to this whole industry, not just to one player, and we need someone to lead the charge on that ambition. <br /><br />WHO WE'RE LOOKING FOR:<br /><br />We’re looking for someone to work directly with the founders of the business to drive our growth into micrombility. The role will be a blend of strategy and sales - becoming an expert in this fast growing industry and building strong relationships with decision makers inside some of the fastest growing tech companies right now as well as the city officials who are trying to keep up with them. You’ll also help shape our product strategy by bringing your thinking to how we offer value to these operators beyond just navigation and cement our position as an invaluable layer in the industry. <br /><br />You’ll have a year or two of commercial experience under your belt and be comfortable with market analysis. More important than your experience will be your ability to think analytically, look at the big strategic picture and most importantly, be fascinated by how the shifts in urban transport could change the shape of cities in the future!<br /><br /><br />IMPACT OF THE WORK:<br />Two wheeled transport is set to play a huge role in the future of our cities as well as a leisure activity, and we think our products will be a key enabler to this growth. Bike use is growing for good reasons – the combined impact of improving citizens’ health and wellbeing as well as the broader environmental benefits make this a no brainer. <br /><br />The trend in micromobility is a huge driver in this change (as well as two wheeled delivery fleets like Deliveroo and Uber Eats and the growth of e-bikes). Providing them with great navigation will both enable them to grow and maximise their positive impact and will likely be the strongest area of growth for our business for the next few years. So you’ll be absolutely pivotal in the success of Beeline as well as making the world a better place. <br /><br /><br />WE CAN OFFER YOU:<br />A competitive salary and generous options (shares)<br />Hands on startup experience working with the founders in a business-critical role <br />A part to play in the future of urban transport<br />A relaxed, supportive and jovial team culture - we aim to take our work seriously without taking ourselves too seriously. Socials in the pub or running round the local park are commonplace! <br />The opportunity to shape the future of this young, growing company<br /><br />YOU CAN OFFER US:<br />1-3 years commercial experience (likely finance or consulting, but not a must)<br />Interest in the future of cities and mobility<br />A rounded skillset: <br />Research skills<br />analytical skills for developing Go-To-Market strategy<br />Strong interpersonal skills for developing relations with cities and operators<br />Creativity, especially for product strategy<br />Comfortable designing and implementing processes - this is a fairly new role in a fast-paced area: adaptability and speed of execution will be crucial <br /><br />",

Our mission is to create a world where anyone with an idea can find space to make it happen. We’ve raised over $20m in funding to date - from tier one investors Balderton and Octopus, as well as some of the world’s largest landlords. Named one of Wired Magazine's ‘100 Hottest Start-Ups’ and The Financial Times’ most ‘Disruptive Companies,’ Appear Here has become the go-to destination to make innovative and creative retail ideas happen across London, Paris and New York.

It's everyone's responsibility to figure out how to optimize everything!<br />- Research the brands' marketing and commercial strategies and creatively find ways to promote the use of short term retail space<br /><br />THE TEAM<br /><br />The Commercial Team is responsible for all aspects of helping brands find the right space for a successful short term rental on the AH platform.

    "content": "Our start-up is a data/marketing B2B online platform that has received interest from a variety of start-ups, SME's and franchises, spanning multiple sectors across the UK. We aim to expand our platform in the US within the next thirty-six months. <br /><br />We combine market research, digital advertising and paid surveys to offer an all-in-one powerful and effective online platform. Our platform delivers targeted consumer data to organisations through survey responses filled out by our users. Survey campaigns are created by researchers, promoted by our promoters and completed by our users. We aim to build a more ethical and efficient data market where consumers, freelancers and SME's are treated and rewarded fairly. <br /><br />We have a growing sign-up list of users however as I lack experience in sales and business development, our start-up is in need of a savvy, persistent and bright individual who wishes to learn and help grow a truly disruptive product. The ideal co-founder can manage the entire business development and sales side of the company, including outreach to potential clients, booking and attending client meetings, and pitching and selling the product in-person and on multiple platforms. <br /><br />As a team, we work from home and set weekly meetings to effectively communicate. We aim to relocate into a small office in the coming months, depending on our outreach success. The ideal co-founder can travel easily and is able to attend occasional team meetings in central London. So far, the role is unpaid and the successful applicant would have significant shares in the company, with the intention of growing the company over a 5+ year period. <br /><br />I believe people are the most precious resource in an organisation. This is not a journey for the faint-hearted and though I am still learning myself, I'm an incredibly driven and motivated young entrepreneur who focuses on building sustainable, long-term relationships with both clients and the team. Don't worry if you're not incredibly experienced, I prioritise potential over achievements. <br /><br />If your ambition is to grow a start-up from the ground up and begin working as part of a small team of 3 to build a platform into a global brand, you've come to the right vacancy.",

Our first product streamlines recruiting scheduling and coordination, saving teams hundreds of hours a month. We’re just getting started on, and have our sights set on making hiring a great experience for recruiters, hiring managers, and candidates. We’re building the platform to engage these key stakeholders and fix the $200 billion per year hiring industry.   <br>   <br>This is an exceptional opportunity to join a small and fast-growing startup, transforming an industry with powerful and easy to use products customers love. As an early employee you'll have tons of ownership, a big impact on product, a say in our values, and opportunities to tremendously accelerate your career growth.   <br>   <br>We're building a remote team and looking for the best individuals - no matter where you are. All we require is a reliable internet connection and passion for building an amazing company.   <br>   <br>**What We’re Looking For**   <br>   <br>This person is excited about scaling the revenue side of a business. They’re a salesperson first, always customer-focused, thoughtful about creating and scaling processes, and eager to own (and crush) a revenue number.   <br>   <br>Initially, this job will consist primarily of selling (from prospect to close). There will be many other hats to wear – potentially ranging from demand gen, to CS, to support, and even product thinking – and this person is excited to take on new challenges.   <br>   <br>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, and this person is eager to own and be accountable for revenue growth. They’re always looking for ways to add the most value, which may shift and evolve over time.   <br>   <br>**What We Value**   <br>   <br>In addition to ownership and accountability, we believe in: challenging the status quo, having empathy, being direct, being honest, and that nothing is “not my job.”   <br>   <br>**What We Offer**   <br>   <br>* Autonomy, impact, and ownership. As an early employee you’ll shape the product direction and company values.   <br>* Competitive salary and significant equity in a fast growing, early stage startup.   <br>* Remote employment - work where you want, when you want.   <br>* Generous vacation policy - take time whenever you need to recharge. Building a lasting company is a marathon, not a sprint.   <br>* Top-notch healthcare, dental, and vision coverage.   <br>* Life and disability insurance.   <br>* Annual company retreat - helps build camaraderie as a remote team.   <br>* Computer and home office setup - we'll buy anything you need to do your best work.   <br>* Continuing education allowance - learn what you want, when you want.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- USA   <br>  </div> </div>",

No company politics or popularity contests. We are a team of &quot;producers&quot;... people who are results oriented and believe that each person should be responsible for themselves.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>#5. Great People</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You'd be joining an existing team of superstars, many of whom have been with the company for years.

If you're that kind of person – you'll fit in perfectly.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>#6.

That's what we love to do. We are looking for an Inside Sales Representative who is hungry and eager to pursue the volume of opportunities we bring in every day, but haven’t historically been positioned to serve, to support, and ultimately, to convert to Crazy Egg customers. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You will be joining a small, but passionate Crazy Egg team. You will have clearly articulated goals, a playbook we’ve been building internally for 6 months as a baseline, and a clear set of opportunities to work from when you’re ready to dive in (after we get you trained and comfortable with the product, our customers, and our shared goals). We believe a super majority of your first year will be spent closing opportunities that have been organically generated vs having to do any sort of outbound pursuit. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Here's what that looks like at Crazy Egg, and here are the values you’d be excited to stand behind:</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>As a team we strive for:</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li><span>Direct, undeniable, customer impact.

As awesome as Salesforce is (we are entirely built on the native platform) there are many gaps in the tools utilized for Salesforce development. Teams struggle with outdated, cobbled-together solutions.</div><div><br></div><div>Most dev-ops vendors were leveraging the tools built for traditional development platforms and did not handle the unique needs of the Salesforce platform, causing great inefficiencies and frustrations.</div><div><br></div><div>So we built Flosum.</div><div></div><div></div><div><br></div><div><h3></h3><h3>About Us:</h3></div><div>Flosum helps hundreds of companies of all shapes and sizes efficiently and effectively manage their Salesforce development needs.</div><div><br></div><div>The Flosum team now spans seven time zones and supports clients at some of the top companies in the world.
