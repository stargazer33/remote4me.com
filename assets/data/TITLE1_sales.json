    "content": "<h3>Account Manager (Berlin) // Pleo</h3><div> Company:  Pleo <br> <br></div><div> Tags:</div><li>English</li><li>Account Manager</li><li>Account Executive</li><div>  <p>If you’re looking for a typical sales job, you’re in the wrong place.</p>  <p>What we’re looking for is a natural leader who believes that a steep personal journey is the best way to grow, and would like to prove themselves through scale. We’re looking for someone who will start in one role, and use their account management skills to progress them into another role that might not even exist today.</p>  <p>This highly ambitious role is not for the faint-hearted. The personal – and company – growth curve you’ll see is comparable to none. This is a role where autonomy is not only encouraged, but also required. And the most exciting part? You’ll be a part of building the future of work.</p>  <p><strong>What’s the product?</strong></p>  <p>We are Pleo – it’s a part of who we are as a tech company. We help customers to delegate employee spending through a business spending platform. This ends out of pocket spending, encourages autonomy and trust in employees, and takes a huge burden off the finance team. You’ll be selling the SaaS tool (expensing platform) that comes with physical pre-paid cards (so with a fintech twist) that are then distributed to all employees of the company. The best part is we’re all users of Pleo ourselves – so it’s a very applicable tool. It impacts anyone in a company who could spend money on behalf of their business – be it a coffee with clients or a Mac for a new hire.</p>  <p><strong>What does it revolve around?</strong></p>  <p>For us, the most important stakeholders are our users. We have a very special relationship with them – we even build most of our product features based on what they’re looking for. We get so excited when our clients share their unboxing of their Pleo cards on LinkedIn, and see how dramatically Pleo can solve their pains. We as employees also share our own pains, and then we come together to try and solve them.</p>  <p>As an Account Manager your primary point of contact are the Pleo admins. These are the CFOs, CEOs, MDs, Operations Directors and everyone else who might be the decision maker in regards to the spending policy in a company. We ensure that our Pleo admins are knowledgeable about the product and equipped to roll out our product to all their employees. You should be able to and feel comfortable speaking to everyone – your touch points will range from Financial Assistants and interns to CFOs and MDs.</p>  <p><strong>Who’s the team?</strong></p>  <p>On the sales side of things, we’re a team that’s a mix of business development representatives and account managers. The BDRs (as we like to call them) help AMs book meetings.</p>  <p><strong>What’s up to me?</strong></p>  <p>Pretty simply – to bring the good news of Pleo to your country, and get them to use it. The nice thing is there’s so much freedom here. If you’re an expert outbounder – do that. If you’re a genius with email outreach, go that way. You will have targets of new active users – but how you get them is up to you. You’ll also be supported by marketing – who deliver warm leads straight into your pipe (at a above-industry-standard rate).</p>  <p><strong>What markets are we in?</strong></p>  <p>Great question! We currently service over 1000s of clients in Denmark, UK, and Sweden and Germany.. Saying that, Pleo users can (and have) used their cards all over the world – from Québec to Cape Town!</p>  <p><strong>Germany, you say? </strong></p>  <p>We’ve grown out of our home market in Denmark, and have seen success in the UK, Sweden, and Germany too. Because of this success, we are investing even more in Germany. To see success here, we need to work with the best who can take us to the next level.</p>  <p><strong>The skills you need to master this role</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Native-level fluency in German</li>   <li>Ambition – lots of it</li>   <li>Optimistic leadership – the ability to trust in the rest of the team and bring out the best in them</li>   <li>Winning attitude – knowing that there are easy days and hard days and the ability to get through them both</li>   <li>Pipeline management – Our sales process is dynamic and fast. You are geared to close sales every day!</li>   <li>A background in sales – experience in managing a sales team a plus!</li>   <li>An entrepreneurial mindset – we need you to build our German presence (and team!)</li>   <li>Exceptional people skills: strong listening abilities, empathy, and genuine and flowing curiosity to learn more about the people you are interacting with</li>   <li>Strong inner motivation paired with a positive mindset (it’s the key to hitting targets ).</li>   <li>Time management</li>   <li>Humility. You ask “How can I create and build more value here?” rather than “What’s in it for me?”</li>   <li>Ability to work in a high energy sales environment </li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Your colleagues say you</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Work in English with ease (it’s our company language)</li>   <li>Are easy to work with</li>   <li>Leave no lead unturned</li>   <li>Are a team player – we have no room for sharp elbows or politics in our sales teams</li>   <li>Share knowledge</li>   <li>Ask for feedback all the time</li>   <li>Are a person they would also enjoy having a coffee with (virtual or not)</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Your mom says that you</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Don’t need to be told twice to get things done</li>   <li>Take on challenges</li>   <li>Put on a brave smile even when you don’t want to</li>   <li>Were always going to make her proud (moms)</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Show me the benefits!</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Your own Pleo card (no more out-of-pocket spending)</li>   <li>Flexible working remote options for those onsite (just speak to your team)</li>   <li>Quarterly trips to somewhere for team camps (both company-wide ones and team-specific ones). The last one was Berlin in June this year, including a drag queen show (we went authentic-Berlin), here’s a sneak peak to give you an idea https://youtu.be/Ooy0JCJzNzc</li>   <li>Investment in learning &amp; developing (just check with your team for what’s reasonable, we don’t have set budgets)</li>   <li>Catered lunch in the office</li>  </ul>  <p>Working at Pleo means you’re working on something very exciting: the future of work. Through fintech we’ve seen a way to impact how people work; we think company spending should be delegated to all employees and teams, that it should be as automated as possible, and that it should drive a culture of responsible spending.</p>  <p>Being HQ’d out of Copenhagen means we’re inspired by sensible things like a good work-life balance, whether our office is in Copenhagen or not.</p>  <p><strong>Sometimes, people write nice things about us</strong></p>  <p>No one says it quite like our customers. Hear what they have to say this week on Trustpilot here:<br> https://www.trustpilot.com/review/pleo.io</p>  <p>Or check out TechCrunch’s latest article on Pleo here:</p>  <blockquote>  <p><a href='https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/14/pleo-series-b/' rel='nofollow'>Pleo, the multi-card business spending platform, closes $56M Series B</a></p> </blockquote>  <p></p>  <p><strong>What am I in for?</strong></p>  <p>We’re pretty transparent about how we hire, you can read all about it <a href='https://blog.pleo.io/how-we-hire/' rel='nofollow'>here</a>.</p>  <p>Also, always check out Glassdoor if you’d like to hear it from other people:<br> https://glassdoor.com/Reviews/Pleo-Reviews-E1518165.htm</p> </div><a href='https://jobs.lever.co/pleo/6a2de03d-dbfb-4213-b12e-c89c390cf404' rel='nofollow'>Apply for this position</a>",

We provide 750 companies worldwide with a feedback platform so their employees can learn from each other and grow professionally. SoundCloud, Zapier, Strava, Duolingo and many more use our SAAS solution company-wide — from the intern to the CEO.<br><br></div><div>In an continuing effort to expand our customer base, we are looking for a business developer to assist us in working with prospects and customers alike.<br><br></div><div>This position is remote – you can work anywhere in the US EST timezone.<br><br></div><h3>What you’ll do</h3><div>We’re a <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/' rel='nofollow'>company of 35 people in Berlin and the US</a> and looking to grow. Our product is a performance feedback platform rolled out company-wide from the intern to the CEO. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives, organize one-on-one meetings, and to praise each other for a job well done.<br><br></div><div>We’ve got a <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/customer-team/' rel='nofollow'>very strong customer team</a> in place, and want to get even better at showcasing our product, working with prospects, and ensuring a smooth roll-out. We’re not a super salesy organization, but are looking to increase the awareness of our tool. So if you are interested in making a difference in a fast-paced and international environment, this could be for you!<br><br></div><div>The job will focus on three major aspects:</div><ul><li><strong>Help convert leads into happy customers:</strong> Our pipeline is full so you’ll be busy. Our initial discovery demos with prospects are an essential gauge to determine whether our solution is the right fit for their needs. You’ll learn to understand the mindset of the HR professional, be a great listener, and never over-promise. This is a people business and our job is more guide than pitch.</li><li><strong>Generate new leads:</strong> The pipeline could always be fuller! You’ll work closely with Marketing as they nurture leads upstream, actively looking for ways to connect the dots within our inbound strategy. You’ll occasionally attend events we sponsor, you’llinnovate on our existing processes, workflows and sales collateral, and you’ll help with competitor analysis to improve our targeting.</li><li><strong>Ensure customers are happy beyond the purchase:</strong> Our dedicated customer success and support teams are in charge of retention and happiness. You’ll help by making the onboarding handover smooth, and offer semi-regular check-ins to ensure we close our feedback loop.</li><li><strong>And more!</strong> We love people who are well-rounded and have many strengths. Sales, Success, &amp; Support work very closely with each other – so you can expect to spend some time in another team learning about the product and space too. Beyond the core responsibilities you’re welcome to grow into other areas, and are heavily encouraged to help shape the direction of the product! If you want to spread your wings, then we can help you fly.</li></ul><div><br></div><h3>Who we’re looking for</h3><div>You don’t have to tick all the boxes, but we are looking for someone quite special that embodies most of the following:</div><ul><li>You have at least 2 years B2B sales experience.</li><li>You are dynamic, think outside the box, and go the extra mile.</li><li>You have business acumen. You don’t need to have an MBA, but you should be able to understand how companies work and be able to identify what an opportunity or a company on an upwards trajectory looks like.</li><li>You have a strong interest in HR and the future of work (and ideally previous experience in the space). Our <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/customers/' rel='nofollow'>customers</a> include some of the most innovative and forward thinking people and culture leaders around the world, and this absolutely key for someone to be successful in this role.</li><li>You’re a go-getter. If you think something isn’t working and could be improved, fix it! You strive to be the change you seek and like to experiment.</li><li>You are interested in SaaS and the online world in general, and you’re tech savvy and a quick learner.</li><li>You speak English fluently and write well and concisely</li><li>Also, you should be comfortable working remotely. Most Small Improvers work from the HQ in Berlin, including part of the Sales team. We won’t ask you to be available super early to be able to join cross-timezones calls, but you need to be comfortable being flexible to a certain extend (and Berlin people are flexible too, of course). Also, we all make a concerted effort to stay connected and overshare as much as possible, but working without the regular “water cooler talks” is not for everyone. You’ll always need to find new ways to reengage and connect with HQ people, and to be comfortable with managing your own time and workload.</li></ul><div><br></div><h3>More reasons to work at SI</h3><ul><li>We’re international: We’re based in Berlin and sell mainly to the US, Australia and the UK. Our staff of 35 hails from 16 countries (all our written communication is in English)</li><li>We're self-funded — our only &quot;investors&quot; are our amazing <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/customers/' rel='nofollow'>customers</a> who have helped us grow our customer base largely through word of mouth.</li><li>We invest in our people. You’ll get a learning &amp; development budge and days off for attending conferences</li><li>We’re serious about our open and tolerant company culture, and we believe diversity makes our culture and our product better.</li><li>We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales. Also, there are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!</li><li>You’re invited to visit our Berlin head office for three weeks once a year and we cover the costs. Take an <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/office-tour/' rel='nofollow'>office tour</a>.</li><li>We want to do well by doing good, so we turn down dodgy clients and <a href='https://startup.small-improvements.com/lets-good-donations-2017/' rel='nofollow'>donate 2% of our profits</a> to charity.</li><li>And we love to travel! <a href='https://vimeo.com/293382390' rel='nofollow'>Take a look at our last company trip</a>.</li></ul></div>",

Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth—and there is no sign of it slowing down.</p><p>In order to keep hitting our goals, including our 2019 goal of $42 million worth of businesses sold, we need to expand our horizons and improve our customer experience to a point that makes us the de-facto standard for buying and selling online businesses. Your work will help propel the industry forward to new levels not seen before.</p><p><strong>So what is a Migration Advisor?</strong></p><p>A Migration Advisor takes a hands-on role, transferring businesses from sellers to buyers in a safe and efficient manner. This can be a stressful time for both parties as they near completion of a potentially life-changing deal. It will be your mission to oversee the asset transfer, keep things moving forward and ensure that everyone is in the loop regarding the migration status.</p><p>You will spend the first couple of months training with our Migration Supervisor, George Sanderson. The first six months will act as your probationary period, at the end of which (all going well) we’ll have you up and running as a fully-fledged Migration Advisor</p><p><strong>What’s the Opportunity?</strong></p><p>Becoming a Migration Advisor makes you a critical part of Empire Flippers. You will learn skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world. We will teach you all of our methods for transferring online businesses and you’ll be deep-diving into the backend of all of the businesses we sell.</p><p>You will represent our brand and be the face of Empire Flippers to buyers and sellers at an integral part of the buying and selling process.</p><p>Once a buyer and seller agree on a deal, they’ll be transferred to you to close things out. You’ll be the last piece of the puzzle, helping buyers take over their new business and sellers get paid out.</p><p>After all, when a business is sold, a seller can receive a truly life-changing sum of cash for their business. In some cases, we’ve even paid out a million+ dollars to a seller.</p><p><strong>What’s the Position Like?</strong></p><p>The Migration Advisor role is vital to the success of our company.</p><p>Since this role will have you speaking to buyers and sellers around the world, it can be a bit stressful here and there. You will need to work weird hours sometimes to make sure you can get on the phone with sellers in different time zones. You will also need to be extremely detail-oriented to make sure that processes are followed to a tee.</p><p>Not all buyers and sellers are familiar with the technical aspects of migrating a business; you will need to guide them through the process in a clear and logical manner, ensuring all parties know what’s going on.</p><p>Of course, as in any role, sometimes things may not go quite to plan. It’s at this point that your role becomes most critical; you’ll need to calmly troubleshoot issues and make buyers and sellers feel that we have things in hand.</p><p>You will drive all of our migrations through a multi-step migration process. We are constantly refining this process to make the transfer as seamless as possible and ensure that we are in-line with any updates to program terms and conditions. As you become more seasoned, you will be tasked with improving this migration process.</p><p>We will train you on how to use the various tools we use to migrate businesses. You’ll also be digging into the backend of websites and learning about the various technical aspects of moving a site.</p><p>While you don’t have to be a “techie,” having the capacity to learn the technical nuances of the process is a must.</p><p>You’ll also be exposed to contracts and purchase agreements for multi-million dollar deals. It will be your job to ensure that the migration is conducted in line with the contract.</p><p>Finally, on the rare occasion that some form of renegotiation is required during the migration, you’ll run point on that, helping buyers and sellers to reach a point that works for all parties.</p><p><strong>What Skills Do I Need?</strong></p><p>We believe in hiring people that are a good fit for us culturally. A good fit is actually more important to us than the skill sets since we will teach you everything you need to know.</p><p>While no previous work experience is required, having a background in customer service and/or some kind of technical chops is helpful. Plus, there are some qualities that will go a long way in helping you succeed in this position, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>You need to be detail-oriented.</strong>&nbsp;Migration is a meticulous job. You will be closely following our tried and tested processes and it’s vital that steps are followed closely and accurately.</li><li><strong>You need to be a team player.</strong>&nbsp;The migration team regularly interact with other areas of the business. You’ll be working closely with our sales team to ensure a smooth customer transition when a deal is done. You’ll give feedback to our vetting department on processes tweaks they can make to make your life easier. You need to be good at communicating your thoughts and getting buy-in from colleagues.</li><li><strong>You’re good at defusing problems.</strong>&nbsp;Buying and selling a business is an intimate process. There will almost always be obstacles and challenges for you to help both parties overcome. You’ll need to approach problems in a fair and constructive manner, keeping buyers and sellers calm and giving them confidence that you’ve got their back.</li><li><strong>You’re not afraid of getting on the phone.</strong>&nbsp;The migration position will require you to get on the phone a lot with buyers and sellers. Your phone communication needs to be spot-on and you have to be comfortable making those calls to get all the information we need from the buyer and seller.</li></ul><p><strong>What’s the Lifestyle Like?</strong></p><p><strong>Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits!</strong></p><p>We aren’t going to chain you to a cubicle. You’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best. The choice is yours. While we’re an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not a Fortune 500 company. You won’t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our sellers while also helping to increase the number of high-quality businesses that go live on our marketplace.</p><p>When you first start off, you will be working and training with our Migration Supervisor, George Sanderson. Once we get into 2020, we may ask you to attend a couple of weeks of in-person training at a location to be determined. Of course we will cover the cost of any travel that we require you to do during your probationary period.</p><p>You won’t start off making much money.</p><p>For the first six months, you will be paid $2,000 USD per month during the probation period. In addition to this, you’ll get a housing stipend of $700 USD per month for months 1 through 6. While not a lot, it is enough to have an enjoyable time in many countries around the world and (just to remind you) you’ll be completely location independent! After six months, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan. Within 12 months, you can expect to earn $40,000-$46,000 USD per year, and have paid, international healthcare coverage.</p><p>This amount is more than enough to live a very nice lifestyle in Asia or almost anywhere in the world (within reason).</p><p><strong>Love It. What’s the Catch?</strong></p><p>While our lifestyle is pretty great, this isn’t a gap year experience to go travel the world.</p><p>We are looking for career-minded people that can make a positive impact on our business. Sure, sometimes we really do work by the pool, but we also work hard.</p><p>There will be days when you clock in 12 hours. There will also be days when you are up at all sorts of strange hours dealing with our sellers who live anywhere from the U.S. and U.K. to Eastern Europe and Asia.</p><p>While you might take a long break during the middle of the day, you might also find yourself burning the midnight oil as you hop onto a call to get a buyer or seller through the last hump of the migration process.</p><p>A lot of people love the idea of finding a job that allows them to travel the world and get a different job later back home. That is not this job.</p><p>We want you for the long-haul. We want you to grow with us and turn this position into a prosperous career.</p><p><strong>Details to Keep in Mind</strong></p><ul><li>Remember, we’re not going to throw you into the fire from day one.</li><li>When you first come on board, you’re going to learn about our company. We will do a deep dive into how our processes and systems work, set you up in the backend, and teach you about each department within the business.</li><li>We’ll start you off with low-level tasks. As you get better acquainted with our business, we will gradually build up your workload, get you comfortable with routine migrations, and then start having you take on more ambitious projects.</li><li>We will review every application that comes our way. If we believe you’re a good fit for us, we will reach out to set up an interview. Typically, there are two rounds of interviews before we make a decision.</li><li>If you believe you’re a good fit, you have until October 13, 2019 to apply.</li><li>A background check is required before employment.</li></ul><p><strong>How Do I Apply?</strong></p><p>Here is the sequence of events we use when hiring our new Migration Advisor:</p><ul><li>You record a YouTube video* explaining who you are and why you’re a good fit for the position, fill out an application by clicking the link below, and submit it ASAP by October 13, 2019.</li><li>We review submissions and schedule first interviews.</li><li>Once second interviews are done, a final decision is made.</li><li>The chosen candidate will be announced by the end of October.</li><li>The chosen candidate will start with the company on December 2nd, 2019.</li></ul><p><strong>YouTube Video Requirements:</strong></p><p>We will only accept submissions that include a YouTube URL.

Working for a variety of global clients from different industries, Strange Thoughts&rsquo; work is never the same, making TV ads for a gaming retailer one moment and an internet connected pair of trainers for a sportswear brand the next. Our goal, since 2014, has been to deliver amazing, tech-led, creative for bold brands. We have a unique model of crowd-sourcing expertise from the cutting edge of technology and creative through a network which allows very different minds to co-create, a process we like to call Radical Collaboration.

We act as the translators of talent enabling us to pair the perfect Strange Thinkers with every client's needs.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Rarely idle, our network is ever-generating amazing ideas, which have included drones that collect cloud water to use in the brewing process for a beer called Sky.P.A (Innis and Gunn), a dog collar that allows pet owners to understand what their furry friend is thinking (Fetch) and a mind controlled beer pouring robot (Marriott Hotels).&nbsp;</p><br /><p><br /><br /></p><br /><p><strong>About the role</strong>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>As an employee for the Strange Thoughts your role will be varied and (hopefully) exciting.

This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours. Across the UK, connected communities are simply not happening.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>This is where School Space comes in.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - How</strong></p><br /><p>Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays. We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the center of a thriving community.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - Team</strong></p><br /><p>Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 8 years. We started the 19/20 academic year with 41 partner schools who, over the past 3 years we have raised almost &pound;1 million for. The company has also been nominated for numerous awards including Jemma and James being recognised in Forbes&rsquo; &lsquo;30 Under 30&rsquo; list and School Space being named one of Escape the Cities Top 100 employers.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our team are committed to the social mission of our company and working to help the business grow (and help more schools!). We hold daily stand ups to keep everyone in the loop and &lsquo;Party Calls&rsquo; at 5pm every Friday to share success from the week. We hold a monthly social every month to get the whole team together (particularly those who work remotely!). Activities have included going to cricket matches, punting in Oxford, bowling and cocktail making.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>The team come from a range of backgrounds and experience with some recent grads and some industry veterans. In the mix we have a keen martial artist, a man who can name and rate every restaurant within a 20 min walk of our office, Oxbridge graduates, an Olympic torch bearer and a woman who once ran a marathon on a bet.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, colour, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</strong></p>",

We provide 750 companies worldwide with a feedback platform so their employees can learn from each other and grow professionally. SoundCloud, Zapier, Strava, Duolingo and many more use our SAAS solution company-wide — from the intern to the CEO.<br><br></div><div>In an continuing effort to expand our customer base, we are looking for a business developer to assist us in working with prospects and customers alike.<br><br></div><div>This position is remote – you can work anywhere in the US EST timezone.<br><br></div><h3>What you’ll do</h3><div>We’re a <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/' rel='nofollow'>company of 35 people in Berlin and the US</a> and looking to grow. Our product is a performance feedback platform rolled out company-wide from the intern to the CEO. Our clients’ staff use it to give and receive feedback about their work, to set goals and objectives, organize one-on-one meetings, and to praise each other for a job well done.<br><br></div><div>We’ve got a <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/customer-team/' rel='nofollow'>very strong customer team</a> in place, and want to get even better at showcasing our product, working with prospects, and ensuring a smooth roll-out. We’re not a super salesy organization, but are looking to increase the awareness of our tool. So if you are interested in making a difference in a fast-paced and international environment, this could be for you!<br><br></div><div>The job will focus on three major aspects:</div><ul><li><strong>Help convert leads into happy customers:</strong> Our pipeline is full so you’ll be busy. Our initial discovery demos with prospects are an essential gauge to determine whether our solution is the right fit for their needs. You’ll learn to understand the mindset of the HR professional, be a great listener, and never over-promise. This is a people business and our job is more guide than pitch.</li><li><strong>Generate new leads:</strong> The pipeline could always be fuller! You’ll work closely with Marketing as they nurture leads upstream, actively looking for ways to connect the dots within our inbound strategy. You’ll occasionally attend events we sponsor, you’llinnovate on our existing processes, workflows and sales collateral, and you’ll help with competitor analysis to improve our targeting.</li><li><strong>Ensure customers are happy beyond the purchase:</strong> Our dedicated customer success and support teams are in charge of retention and happiness. You’ll help by making the onboarding handover smooth, and offer semi-regular check-ins to ensure we close our feedback loop.</li><li><strong>And more!</strong> We love people who are well-rounded and have many strengths. Sales, Success, &amp; Support work very closely with each other – so you can expect to spend some time in another team learning about the product and space too. Beyond the core responsibilities you’re welcome to grow into other areas, and are heavily encouraged to help shape the direction of the product! If you want to spread your wings, then we can help you fly.</li></ul><div><br></div><h3>Who we’re looking for</h3><div>You don’t have to tick all the boxes, but we are looking for someone quite special that embodies most of the following:</div><ul><li>You have at least 2 years B2B sales experience.</li><li>You are dynamic, think outside the box, and go the extra mile.</li><li>You have business acumen. You don’t need to have an MBA, but you should be able to understand how companies work and be able to identify what an opportunity or a company on an upwards trajectory looks like.</li><li>You’re keen in learning about the HR tech market, what makes for great workplaces, what motivates people, and how the workplace of the future might look like. We can’t do our jobs well unless we really know our customers and their needs.</li><li>You’re a go-getter. If you think something isn’t working and could be improved, fix it! You strive to be the change you seek and like to experiment.</li><li>You are interested in SaaS and the online world in general, and you’re tech savvy and a quick learner.</li><li>You speak English fluently and write well and concisely</li><li>Also, you should be comfortable working remotely. Most Small Improvers work from the HQ in Berlin, including part of the Sales team. We won’t ask you to be available super early to be able to join cross-timezones calls, but you need to be comfortable being flexible to a certain extend (and Berlin people are flexible too, of course). Also, we all make a concerted effort to stay connected and overshare as much as possible, but working without the regular “water cooler talks” is not for everyone. You’ll always need to find new ways to reengage and connect with HQ people, and to be comfortable with managing your own time and workload.</li></ul><div><br></div><h3>More reasons to work at SI</h3><ul><li>We’re international: We’re based in Berlin and sell mainly to the US, Australia and the UK. Our staff of 35 hails from 16 countries (all our written communication is in English)</li><li>We’re self-funded, transparent and profitable, and our customer base is growing.</li><li>We frequently ship new features and focus on quality product rather than on aggressive sales.</li><li>There are very few regular meetings, and processes are kept to a bare minimum. Need to improve some process? Just do it!</li><li>You’re invited to visit our Berlin head office for three weeks once a year and we cover the costs. Take an <a href='https://www.small-improvements.com/company/office-tour/' rel='nofollow'>office tour</a>.</li><li>And we love to travel! <a href='https://vimeo.com/293382390' rel='nofollow'>Take a look at our last company trip</a>.</li></ul></div>",

Al this is easily managed in an online portal for customers</p><br /><p>We already have over 30 clients despite launching in just April 2018, many of which are amongst the top fleets in the UK.
