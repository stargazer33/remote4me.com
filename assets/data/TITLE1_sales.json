We are revolutionising cloud migrations globally by building the world's first fully automated cloud migration platform. Everyone recognises that cloud computing is the future of IT. It can reduce costs, offer business agility and scalability and can be a platform for utilising countless opportunities, embracing the best of IT innovation.</p><br /><p>The journey to the cloud, however, is very complex and expensive. Most SMEs and even some large enterprises cannot afford the high cost to migrate. We are set to disrupt the global $120B market (expected to reach $448B by 2025) by offering the first of its kind solution that empowers companies of all size to make the critical transformational step. Our fully automated platform allows companies to migrate to the cloud 3-10x cheaper and 6-10x faster than traditional managed migrations services (from the likes of Accenture, IBM, DXC Technology and more).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We have built a very substantial MVP that automatically migrates Linux servers to AWS and we are currently fundraising so we can expand it to a full platform that has substantial capabilities and includes the other big clouds. In the current lockdown, fundraising has been put on hold but we are still actively looking to find companies that we can help migrate.</p><br /><p>In this sense, we are looking for sales professionals who are currently furloughed and are curious to help spread the message for a unique innovative technology. This is mainly working on finding and presenting to new customers, following leads from social media campaigns and everything else involved in B2B software sales. Ideally, we are looking for candidates with experience in B2B software sales or other tech sales.</p><br /><p>For now, we are only looking for furloughed volunteers. However, once we get funded, there would be permanent job opportunities for the right talent. We are a small, friendly and very passionate team spread across London, Sofia (Bulgaria) and Buenos Aires (Argentina).&nbsp;</p><br /><p>If what we are doing excites you and you are looking to add your mark and keep busy during the lockdown, we would love to hear from you. Keep safe :-)</p>",
