This is the first problem we&rsquo;re trying to solve.</p><br /><p>Secondly, a recent study (conducted by the Eden project) identified that disconnected communities cost the UK economy over &pound;32 billion/year. Extensive research has concluded that people feel happier, safer and more content when they live in connected communities and know their neighbours. Across the UK, connected communities are simply not happening. This is where School Space comes in.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - How</strong></p><br /><p>Schools have lots of spaces that sit empty on evenings, weekends, and holidays. We work with schools across the South East to help them let their spaces to community groups, which not only increases school income, it also makes affordable spaces available to the locals which in turn helps to build a thriving school at the center of a thriving community.</p><br /><p><strong>School Space - Team</strong></p><br /><p>Founders James and Jemma have been working on this problem for 7 years, and recent success includes investment raises, 36 partner schools, over half a million generated for them. We&rsquo;ve been on the Techstars 2018 Cohort, been nominated for Social Enterprise UK&rsquo;s Social Enterprise of the Year,&nbsp; and picked up a few awards and amazing networks along the way. Our team are committed to the nth degree and full of the belief that social business is the model of the future. We have endless determination to see School Space grow fast and well, scaling our impact across the UK and beyond. In the mix we have Oxbridge graduates, marathon runners, a pilot, industry veterans, an Olympic torch bearer and a woman who once ran a marathon on a bet.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>The Role - Why</strong></p><br /><p>The more community users (those that hire our school spaces) the greater impact we can have - and we need to hire an amazing, motivated person to find and engage them. With every booking you secure, you will make an impact on the education sector (and some commission too..).</p><br /><p><strong>The Role - How</strong></p><br /><p>Key responsibilities include:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Find and qualify new leads through web searches, local meetups, classified ads and community networks</li><br /><li>Create target lists and prioritise activities</li><br /><li>Identify the key stakeholders, and organise meetings through calls, emails, and social media&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Build relationships with new prospects over the phone or email and demonstrate the value of School Space to them from the first interaction</li><br /><li>Match prospective customers with the best spaces for them and qualify the opportunity including identifying any key blockers</li><br /><li>Collaborate with Sales Executives and the Director/co-founder you report into, to convey details of the opportunities and arrange discovery calls or meetings with the prospective leads.</li><br /><li>Achieve or exceed monthly quotas of qualified opportunities and closed business&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Suggest innovative ways to catch customers&rsquo; attention and obtain new meetings with them.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What we want from you:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Hustle.</li><br /><li>A track record of high achievement, going above and beyond&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Resilience - the ability to persist, overcome objections and engage stakeholders effectively</li><br /><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Previous successful sales experience OR a strong desire to begin a sales career&nbsp;</li><br /><li>The ability and desire to work in a fast-paced, challenging environment with peers who challenge you to constantly improve</li><br /><li>Natural curiosity with sincere empathy for customers - a people person.</li><br /><li>The technical aptitude to master our CRM tools</li><br /><li>A motivation to hit targets and earn commission</li><br /><li>An eagerness to take on more responsibility, and you thrive on change - we are a start up and that means things are fast moving.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

We are a brand new Cambridge-based commercial teamwho has just raised Seed, and we’re growing our user base 10-20% month overmonth. You’ll be a Commercial Account Executive, working with the ChiefCommercial Officer and sometimes (which means “often”) directly with the CEO.You’ll help new clients understand the business and our technology, and how itsolves the problems they’re having with personal data, general innovation, andAI. Come on board if you want to pull weight at one of the most interestingyoung technology companies to come out of Cambridge.<br></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Specific Duties and Responsibilities</b></p><p><i>Commercial Account Management</i></p><p>We’re a brand new technology, and our clients need time and support to understand what we can do for their business (which is a lot). You’ll help them understand everything we do, and how it helps them with their technology innovation, digital transformation, personal data, and AI.</p><p><i>Sales</i></p><p>We support and work with real big global clients and real small local startups, and your job is to offer something to all of them. You’ll build out an exceptional network doing this job, and if you’re amazing at the communications and followup bits of account management you’ll have a huge impact here. Everyone will want to be your friend, because you’re going to be friends with all our clients!</p><p><i>Growth Sprints</i></p><p>DataSwift is developing a growth and marketing engine targeting developers, startups, and other fast-growing businesses alongside (and during) your work. You’re going to help with this as well - you will contribute weekly to the business development and marketing sprints, working with the CCO (me) to develop a scalable engine of growth. If Eric Ries said it, we’re doing it.</p><p><i>External Comms</i></p><p>You will be the first point of contact for all of our new and existing business. We’re depending on you.</p><p><i>Reporting and Insights</i></p><p>We track our business development accurately and do a great job refining our pipelines down until they sing sea shanties. You’re going to be the ultimate authority on exactly how much business we’re doing and how we could be doing more.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Skills, Qualifications and Experiences:</b></p><p><i>Communications – </i>you are joining an elite (*buffs nails*) team of early business-side startuppers, working on the hardest job in startups: early-stage growth. Good, no, great communication is essential. If you’ve never worked in startups before that’s ok too - we’ll teach you everything you need to know. Which reminds me…</p><p><i>Learning - </i>very, very few people have elite-level experience in high-growth startups. If you do (awesome, come work with us!!) you know that learning is a huge part of the job. If you don’t this is going to be a place where you can pick up hundreds if not thousands of new skills, and really stretch your abilities. Sound fun?</p><p><i>Customer relations – </i>you can talk to anyone; no, not in that fake, salesman-y sort of way but in the way that suits you. You are diligent about communications, you want to deeply help and understand your customers, and you care. You got this.</p><p><i>Time management – </i>we have too much to do, and you will too. If you can work well under pressure and manage your time and tasks efficiently, you’re going to love it here.</p><p><i>Executive support – </i>you know everything there is to know about being helpful. You probably really like being helpful. I mean, being helpful is awesome, why wouldn’t you?</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>What’s in it for you:</b></p><p>This is an entry-level role paying £20,000-30,000 a year, and you’ll earn equity as well. You’ll work in a fast-paced environment with a lot of flexibility, and you can more or less work as remotely as you like. You’ll get some expenses covered, you’ll have lot’s of opportunities for advancement, and you’ll be joining us right after we’ve raised Seed (and before Series A), which is almost the perfect time to join a young Startup. You’ll have a lot of responsibilities and you’ll learn a ton.</p><p><b>The pitch from us:</b></p><p>This is a chance to work on the most important problems in tech: data problems. You can fix Cambridge Analytica and help pioneer the future of the digital economy.</p><p>You'll work with a young, driven growth team with a range of skills. You can also help shape that team, as we're still small and are building our internal culture.</p><p>We have good flexibility. We can foster remote working and we have family-friendly setups and understanding for our teams. We're very international as well, with team members from Canada, the UK, Malaysia, Greece, and Germany.</p><p>Things are going to move quickly here, and your personal development is one of our big focuses, and so is the development of our team as we onboard our new customers. You're joining the company right at Seed stage - so stable enough to be responsible, but young enough for there still to be lots of responsibility to go around.</p><p>We cultivate a culture of open-mindedness and flexibility with discipline and hard work. On top of a competitive salary, you get financial perks like equity, and the responsibilities of leadership. We're building a representative team and you'll work under one of the highest-paid female academics and CEOs in the UK. Hope you can join us.</p><p>Oh, and I'm Jonathan, by the way. Great to meet you.</p>",

You believe that the only way to grow is to be independent and always be learning. Prior experience at a startup or SaaS company is highly preferred.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You genuinely enjoy helping and talking to people. You realize that sales is about building authentic long-term relationships. You must have prior sales or SDR experience that shows this.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Your are creative and tech savvy. You realize that your prospects get flooded with cold emails and you look for ways to stand out from the crowd. Experience with outbound software (Outreach.io, Salesloft) and other sales tech (GoVideo, Cirrus Insight) is a big plus!</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You focus on quality over quantity. You believe that it is better to write ten high quality cold emails versus one hundred cookie-cutter emails.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You don’t make excuses. You realize that there will always be objections and you get a thrill from dealing with them.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>ABOUT US</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We started in 2014 with three founders. We are currently a hybrid-remote team of 12 people that is spread over 6 different cities worldwide.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re fully independent and bootstrapped with $0 raised from VCs or investors. We did this so we can focus on the two things that matter the most: our customers and our team.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Every customer we have today was sourced using our own product (Prospect) or via word-of-mouth. Our sales team is very small (&lt; 3 people) and you will work very closely with our CEO on a regular basis.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND PERKS</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>The salary for this role is $80,000 Canadian dollars (OTE; $40,000 base, $40,000 commission). This will be adjusted as you start doing your own meetings and start closing deals.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You can choose to work from our Kitchener-Waterloo office, entirely remote (any country), or a blend of both. You are encouraged to work where you perform best.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We believe that you should have good equipment to do your work and we give a laptop of your choice once you’re up and running.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We give ample time off. Everyone gets 4 weeks paid-time-off. Additionally, we work four-day workweeks every July and August. We also offer a generous vacation allowance.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>If you are authorized to work in Canada, we will also give you health benefits under our company HSA. If you decide to work from the office, you will also get daily catered lunches.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>WHAT’S NEXT</b></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>If this sounds like something you would like to be a part of, we would love to hear from you!</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We usually get hundreds of job applicants and we read through every single one of them. We highly recommend applying with a good cover letter if you would like to stand out.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Within two weeks of applying, you will hear from us if you’ve made it to the next stage which will be a quick culture screening. You will then have an hour long call with the team. After that, you will proceed to the final stage of interviews which will be specific to the role and then to the final offer.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div></div>",

    "content": "Most experienced SaaS sales professionals have participated in a sales training programme at one point in their careers. Famous sales methodologies like MEDDIC, Value Selling and others, have been adopted by thousands of software organisations throughout the world to help sales teams ultimately deliver better results, sometimes to good effect.<br /><br />What often happens though, is that salespeople have forgettable experiences with these programmes and whilst they may show initial enthusiasm, it is common to see a new methodology rigorously followed for a few months, before disappearing out of sight and mind forever.<br /><br />Todays selection of programmes offer valuable learning, but the delivery of programmes can be a poor experience. Trainings are often much too generic, and almost never align with the unique challenges SaaS businesses face, such as preparing for rapid scale, or future acquisition.<br /><br />SAASco seeks a successful SaaS salesperson to help build a better way for companies to implement successful sales methodologies, process and training, by compiling unique programmes which align with business goals and revolutionise the sales function.<br /><br />The perfect co-founder will have experienced great success working with hyper-growth SaaS businesses in a sales capacity - experience of closing six figure deals is essential but seven figure deals will be preferable.<br /><br />Remote working is welcomed but US or UK based persons would be preferred for proximity to SaaS hubs.",

    "content": "Hi. I’m Eric and I’m the Co-Founder &amp; CTO of Itoma 3D Tech. We are a start-up based in Hatfield / North London, UK.\n<br>\n<br>Our Vision is to simplify 3D Modelling &amp; 3D Printing using AI, Robotics &amp; Voice technology to make it at our customer's voice command.\n<br>Big Vision starts with a single niche to make us investable, find a market fit &amp; develop a product so we currently focus on 3D Modelling &amp; 3D Printing for B2B Architecture &amp; Construction and that's the market where we currently develop co-venturing &amp; sales relationships.\n<br>\n<br>This is our product roadmap to get us there: \n<br>itoma.co.uk/3dme-product-demo/ \n<br>And that’s our long-term strategy:\n<br>itoma.co.uk/our-3d-tech-strategy/\n<br>\n<br>We have pre-seed funding, well defined plan &amp; an amazing tech team to get an edge, MVP, first sales, a couple of Letters of Intent, cooperation for innovation with 2 universities, received SEIS &amp; EIS status for UK investors and currently focus on fundraising &amp; sales.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>WHAT:\n<br>We are looking for a person with some sales experience &amp; drive to join our start-up on a flexible, part-time basis for equity with sales commission:\n<br>1. To finish the development of our sales strategy (Mostly B2B to architecture &amp; construction).\n<br>2. Continue contacting leads &amp; develop customer sales strategy.\n<br>3. Get Letters of Intent &amp; sales to help us get funding &amp; develop the product line.\n<br>\n<br>Then once we develop sufficiently – to join us full or part-time as a salaried person or continue as an advisor:\n<br>1. To move to contract stages with B2B sales.\n<br>2. Develop relationships with new customers.\n<br>3. And build the proper sales team to eventually manage.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>PROPOSED IMPACT JD:\n<br>1 month - pick up relationship with existing companies that we met &amp; contacted.\n<br>2 months - 1 Letter of Intent\n<br>3 months - first sales\n<br>6 months - 1 co-venturing relationship for market fit &amp; product development. Multiple sales.\n<br>12 months - 2 co-venturing relationships (in total). Sales volumes. Thinking of international possibilities (initially - for prestige to investors for Series A).\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>WHO:\n<br>We trust that will suit best someone who is already working part-time in sales and looks for the long term but a flexible game with an innovative start-up.\n<br>Or someone who recently retired or semi-retired and wants to get back in the game (even constant holidays get finally boring after ~1 year of constant travelling – we have an example in our team already!).\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>YOUR MOTIVATION:\n<br>Your motivation is more important than a perfect experience. We offer flexibility (eg. home based &amp; set your own hours as long as we all get to our impact goals), support and a product that can take practically any shape, size &amp; colour in exchange (to make it this much easier) \n<br>The possibility to shape the Future is a bonus!\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>You know what they say – set the expectations early but don’t scare everyone off! \n<br>In other words – we are all people so even if you fulfil some of this stuff but eg. have a passion for 3D Printing, Architecture &amp; Construction &amp; innovative tech – then give us a shout. \n<br>But most of all - we are a start-up so the main thing is that we are in it together &amp; like us here - you do not expect salary straight away because we simply can't afford it yet but we will offer commission on sales with equity, which can especially pay off if you've got good contacts in Construction &amp; Architecture industry.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>Best, \n<br>Eric\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>PS Good start is crucial – we sign a mutual NDA with all people who work with us to have a good &amp; open conversation &amp; then have a couple of conversations to build the big picture of where we are going as well as sales plan.",

We leverage that expertise, our processes, and the most cutting edge technology to generate outbound sales opportunities on behalf of our clients. The Account Manager role acts as the interface between our internal teams and the client. You, along with a Senior Account Manager, will need to have the confidence and experience to act as an “expert” in all situations that may arise. If you LOVE sales but want to expand your sales skills beyond the front line, this is a role for you.</p>\n <p>Coordinate and manage projects in conjunction with Senior Account Manager (SAM)</p>\n <p>Each Senior Account Manager may be running 15+ individual accounts.

That’s not us. You will be empowered and expected to critically analyze our processes and our performance to find efficiencies and better ways of doing things so that we can continue to drive exceptional results for our clients. This might include identifying and elevating process issues, poor client campaign performance, or how we’re communicating internally between teams.
