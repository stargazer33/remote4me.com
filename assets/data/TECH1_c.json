Carter Journalism Institute at New York University seek a developer to work on an innovative, grant-funded project working to preserve interactive web applications for data journalism. These applications are typically made of a database, a web server, a web application and a frontend. To fully capture these disparate parts, the Project Team will work to integrate <a href='https://www.reprozip.org/' rel='nofollow'>ReproZip</a> (an open source tool for reproducible research) and open source front-end web archiving tools (e.g. <a href='https://webrecorder.io/' rel='nofollow'>Webrecorder</a>) into one tool to fully capture functionality of modern interactive web applications. The project team includes data journalists, librarians, and software engineers.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>We are looking for a talented developer who is passionate about creating tools and infrastructure to support web archiving. Candidates will work collaboratively to build a tool that will transform and streamline preservation of web applications. For this project, the Developer will add open-source web crawling functionality to ReproZip to fully capture interactive web applications. This prototype will be tested with data journalism applications and updated as new functional specifications emerge. This is a remote work position, though NYC-area applicants may have the option of working on-site in NYC.</p><p><strong>RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>The Developer will work with ReproZip developers. Reporting to the Project Manager, the Developer will be tasked with completing two essential parts related to this project work:</p><ul><li>Continue development of ReproZip by adding web-crawling functionality to capture full-scale interactive web applications and writing accompanying documentation.</li><li>The Developer will work with the Project Team to update the prototype functionality as testing continues.</li></ul><p><strong>QUALIFICATIONS</strong>Required:</p><ul><li>A Master’s degree in Computer Science or related technical fields, or equivalent programming background</li><li>Experience in software development methodology and tools</li><li>Knowledge of C/C++, Python, JavaScript, and SQL (Ruby is a plus)</li><li>Proficiency working with database technology (e.g. Postgres) and modern container and cloud orchestration (e.g. Docker, Vagrant, VirtualBox)</li><li>Understanding of networking, web requests, and HTTP proxies</li><li>Familiarity with the Linux kernel, architecture, and programming interfaces</li><li>Excellent documentation practices for software projects</li><li>Comfortable in working open source and answering user needs in a variety of forums (e.g. email, GitHub issues)</li></ul>",
