The scale of data that comes from that collaboration is immense — 34M+ developers, 2M+ organizations, 100M+ repositories, 1.1B+ contributions, and 200M+ pull requests in 2018.</p><p>Helping developers navigate and understand all of that data is a core part of GitHub’s mission, and an area with potential we’ve only begun to realize. We have high aspirations for how we can help developers understand and navigate code, and for making collaboration more seamless. The foundation for these efforts is Search.</p><p>Search at GitHub, a feature used by millions, is a vital piece of the puzzle, and one which has been underserved over recent years. We are currently reinventing the way that developers can search on the platform — re-thinking everything from the experience to the system architecture supporting it.</p><p>Engineers on the search team will work on challenges of scale, flexibility, and algorithm design to create novel systems to support a new search experience. One that makes development more powerful and more accessible to the increasing population of people taking part in software development.</p><p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll get to work on challenging problems like building the distributed systems that handle search for the world’s largest source code host.</li><li>You’ll play a major role in the design and implementation of our new search platform.</li><li>Users have some very strong opinions about GitHub search — You’ll have a chance to make a bunch of developers’ lives better!</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Writing robust, maintainable code for distributed backend search systems.</li><li>Building the backend components needed to allow users to search across a variety of content types.</li><li>Working with monitoring and automation tools to ensure the availability of our Search systems.</li><li>Providing feedback and code reviews to your peers in a sensible and empathetic way.</li></ul><p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li>Proficiency in Go.</li><li>Experience building, scaling, and maintaining distributed systems.</li><li>Experience making technical decisions accounting for trade-offs.</li><li>Strong communication skills – you speak, and write, your mind well. We’re a distributed team so we’re extra mindful about communication.</li></ul><p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Experience working remotely in a distributed company.</strong></li><li>Experience building and scaling distributed services in Java, Go or C++.</li><li>Experience working in Ruby</li><li>Experience working on a dedicated Search team.</li><li>Experience in information retrieval systems for source code.</li><li>Knowledge of operations practices: monitoring, alerting, metrics, and automation.</li><li>Experience diagnosing and resolving performance problems in complex software systems.</li></ul><p><strong>Who We Are:</strong></p><p>GitHub is the developer company. Over 40 million people use GitHub to build amazing things together across 100 million repositories. We make it easier for developers to be developers: to work together, to solve challenging problems, to create the world’s most important technologies. We foster a collaborative community that can come together as individuals and in teams to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.</p><p><strong>Leadership Principles:</strong></p><ul><li>Customer Obsessed</li><li>Trust by Default</li><li>Ship to Learn</li><li>Own the Outcome</li><li>Growth Mindset</li><li>Global Product, Global Team</li><li>Anything is Possible</li><li>Practice Kindness</li></ul><p><strong>Why You Should Join:</strong></p><p>At GitHub, we constantly strive to create an environment that allows our employees (Hubbers) to do the best work of their lives. We’ve designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily. The other half of our Hubbers work remotely in 18 countries across the globe.</p><p>We are also committed to keeping Hubbers healthy, motivated, focused and creative. We’ve designed our top-notch benefits program with these goals in mind. In a nutshell, we’ve built a place where we truly love working, we think you will too.</p><p>GitHub is made up of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and lifestyles. We embrace diversity and invite applications from people of all walks of life. We don’t discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, disability, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences. Also, if you have a disability, please let us know if there’s any way we can make the interview process better for you; we’re happy to accommodate!</p><p>Please note that benefits vary by country, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask your Talent Partner.</p><p>#LI-POST</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1875361' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip. Joining our team means you are helping us fight the good fight against expense reports that suck!</p><p>We are expanding into the UK market and its very early stage for our London based team. Help shape the team that will launch our global domination of expense reports and maintain a standard of excellence around the world.</p><p>Joining our team means you will be working in our fast paced environment and you are fearless of our next big challenge. Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most discussed perk is our offshore where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we are heading to Vietnam, do you want to join?</p><h3>About You</h3><p>Whether you’re building features like calendar integrations, importing credit card transactions, or pulling information from receipts, you’re self-driven and collaborative. You’re an autonomous individual who is passionate about making code beautiful and effective, and you’re open to working with other engineers and designers to make dreams into reality.</p><p>As a Full Stack Engineer, your responsibilities include:</p><ul><li><p>Squashing bugs: big, small, and hairy!</p></li><li><p>Building features like accounting integrations, travel budgets, and more.</p></li><li><p>Guiding and enabling others in the technical organization: we'll share our editor tricks, dotfiles and productive workflow. Share yours!</p></li><li><p>Asking questions about things you don’t understand and challenging the status quo</p></li></ul><p>For the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:</p><ul><li><p>Has experience writing real-world software to solve real-world solutions.</p></li><li><p>Communicates well, both in the code (WE &lt;3 COMMENTS!) as well as with our team and industry partners</p></li><li><p>Is a natural problem solver</p></li><li><p>Wants to develop and grow their skills in programming and leadership within the organization</p></li></ul><p>While we use a number of different technologies and languages, for this role we are looking for people who already have a strong understanding of JavaScript, PHP, C++, Java, algorithms, and design patterns. This position is the foundation for launching a career with Expensify, with the expectation you’ll carry these skills into new domains.</p><h3>Compensation &amp; Benefits</h3><ul><li><p>Annual Pension Contribution</p></li><li><p>100% Coverage for Dental/Vision Premiums</p></li><li><p>Free Lunch</p></li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?</p></li><li><p>What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?</p></li><li><p>What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?</p></li><li><p>How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</p></li></ol><h3>Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyway! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href='mailto:jobs@expensify.com' rel='nofollow'>jobs@expensify.com</a>. We're excited to hear from you!</h3>",

The company was built on the concept of providing an inexpensive PC-based CAM system at a time when most other systems were expensive CAD-oriented products. CNC Software was one of the first companies to introduce CAD/CAM software designed for both the machinist and the engineer, providing a practical solution to both markets. While the original version of Mastercam focused on two-dimensional (2D) CAM, it was also one of the first micro-based CAM packages to include CAD capabilities. With Mastercam, the engineer could construct his or her own parts quickly and easily as well as machine them, for an affordable price.</p><p><strong>CNC Software Today </strong></p><p>Today, the CNC Software, Inc. corporate headquarters and training facility is located in a company-owned 53,000 sq. ft. environmentally friendly building in Tolland, Connecticut.&nbsp; In addition to the 150 employees located at our corporate facility, the Company has another 50 employees who work remotely for the Company across the United States and Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The real backbone of the over 260,000 installation-strong Mastercam community is our global reseller network. Some of these experts have been with CNC Software since the very beginning. They've helped build shops from the ground up, and have developed a true &quot;partnership&quot; with our customers, offering advice, strategy, and experience to Mastercam users around the world.</p><p><strong>Strengths and Stability </strong></p><p>As an industry leader for over 35 years, CNC Software prides itself on meeting the demanding needs of its customers by providing excellent products at affordable prices. We adhere to our strategy of combining superior software programming with practical shop floor experience. We have remained at the forefront of CAD/CAM technology by listening to our customers' needs, being accessible, and most of all, being dedicated to our customers. CNC Software has provided CAD/CAM solutions to over 250,000 installations worldwide in the mold making, automotive, aerospace, and consumer industries.</p><p><strong>Broad Market Reach with an Eye to the Future </strong></p><p>Mastercam offers solutions for designers and NC programmers in a spectrum of industries, including milling, turning, wire EDM, router programming, plasma cutting, lasers, and 3D design and drafting. CNC Software's customers range from one-person job shops to Fortune 100 manufacturers. The same software that is utilized by corporations such as Boeing, IBM, and Sikorsky is still affordable enough for the small job shop. To ensure a new generation of trained metal and woodworking personnel, Mastercam is available to educational institutions at sizable discounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As CNC Software, Inc. and its flagship Mastercam continue to grow and expand into new markets and technology, our focus remains on our customers.

We unify collaboration technologies like voice, video, and messaging on a single cloud-based platform so users can experience greater efficiency and less hassle each workday. The company is growing rapidly as we move full steam ahead toward our anticipated IPO. Now’s the time to bring your passion and expertise to our Fuze team!</p><p>Our customers use our software across a variety of platforms including Windows, OS X, iOS, Android and web. We build our software to work and provide a great experience across all of these platforms. Whenever possible we use open source technologies like WebRTC or OPAL. Where it makes sense we build our own software stacks. The Real Time Communications team also builds linux-based microservices that provide audio, video, screen share, content, recording and interoperability gateway functions. These microservices use a combination of REST APIs and IETF standards based protocols to provide functionality to our desktop, mobile and web-based clients. These microservices are built with scalability, resiliency and performance in mind.</p><p>The primary task of the Real Time Communications team is to build the heart of our product — the software stacks that power the audio and video communications within our product. This team works across both the client and backend stacks. Within this team you will get exposure to a broad range of technologies and challenges.</p><p>As much as possible we develop cross platform code — sharing code across clients and sometimes between the clients and various backend services. We believe strongly in modularity and code reuse. As we’re developing cross platform code that is often times CPU intensive and performance critical we tend to use C++ as our language of choice for code that requires portability between the clients and servers.</p><p>In this position you will be responsible for owning, developing and maintaining key components in our client media framework or the backend media services. You will develop services that are deployed globally and run in mixed environments including our own datacenters and AWS. You will be responsible for making key technical recommendations and then executing on your recommendations.You will be responsible for coming up with and implementing innovative solution to difficult problems. You must be hands on and have a passion for developing software.</p><p><strong>What You Will Need:</strong></p><ul><li>Expert C++ coding skills with minimum of 7 years experience</li><li>Experience with streaming media protocols (SIP, SDP, H.323)</li><li>Experience developing real-time audio/video communication systems leveraging RTP/RTCP and audio codecs such as Opus, G.711, G.722</li><li>Experience developing networking software including working with socket level programming and UDP/TCP</li><li>Experience developing and shipping high quality applications for OS X, Windows, iOS or Android is an asset</li><li>Experience building production Linux based services is an asset</li><li>Experience with WebRTC</li><li>Experience with Go and/or Python is a plus</li><li>Understanding of the various trade offs when dealing with real-time media</li><li>Drive, passion, dedication and a good attitude</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.fuze.com/careers#!/job/1713684' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

But loopers are hard to use in concerts: they’re totally manual, meaning you have to pay attention to playing your part and operating the looper. This means they’re risky, and for live performances, risky is bad – very bad.<br> The solution to this is zenAud.io ALK, which completely reinvents live looping.

The company was built on the concept of providing an inexpensive PC-based CAM system at a time when most other systems were expensive CAD-oriented products. CNC Software was one of the first companies to introduce CAD/CAM software designed for both the machinist and the engineer, providing a practical solution to both markets. While the original version of Mastercam focused on two-dimensional (2D) CAM, it was also one of the first micro-based CAM packages to include CAD capabilities. With Mastercam, the engineer could construct his or her own parts quickly and easily as well as machine them, for an affordable price.</p><p><strong>CNC Software Today </strong></p><p>Today, the CNC Software, Inc. corporate headquarters and training facility is located in a company-owned 53,000 sq. ft. environmentally friendly building in Tolland, Connecticut.&nbsp; In addition to the 150 employees located at our corporate facility, the Company has another 50 employees who work remotely for the Company across the United States and Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The real backbone of the over 260,000 installation-strong Mastercam community is our global reseller network. Some of these experts have been with CNC Software since the very beginning. They've helped build shops from the ground up, and have developed a true &quot;partnership&quot; with our customers, offering advice, strategy, and experience to Mastercam users around the world.</p><p><strong>Strengths and Stability </strong></p><p>As an industry leader for over 35 years, CNC Software prides itself on meeting the demanding needs of its customers by providing excellent products at affordable prices. We adhere to our strategy of combining superior software programming with practical shop floor experience. We have remained at the forefront of CAD/CAM technology by listening to our customers' needs, being accessible, and most of all, being dedicated to our customers. CNC Software has provided CAD/CAM solutions to over 250,000 installations worldwide in the mold making, automotive, aerospace, and consumer industries.</p><p><strong>Broad Market Reach with an Eye to the Future </strong></p><p>Mastercam offers solutions for designers and NC programmers in a spectrum of industries, including milling, turning, wire EDM, router programming, plasma cutting, lasers, and 3D design and drafting. CNC Software's customers range from one-person job shops to Fortune 100 manufacturers.

The C++ spec weighs a lot, so I'm hesitant to call myself an expert, but I have a good working knowledge of the languages. For a previous employer I worked on a commercial Windows IDE for ~3 years.</p><p>I've been working on the foundations of a 3D game engine for ~3 years, which has taught me a great deal about C, systems and graphics programming on both Win32 and Linux. I chose to build it without libraries (Handmade Hero style) which began as a learning exercise, but ended up teaching me to value simplicity much more than I expected.</p><p>I can configure and maintain webservers, proxies and load balancers having worked with the web for 10 years.</p><p>I have a good understanding of the Linux network stack and APIs at the systems level - I've worked on several custom TCP + UDP protocols in the past.</p><p>I love building tools. Sometimes I feel like I was made to build tools. I build all kinds of tools - tools for computers, tools for automotive maintenance, tools for making tools. I've been building a game engine, which I would consider a collection of tools, for years and I still enjoy working on it.</p><p>Lastly, and I think this is interrelated with the tools thing, I'm a systems programmer at heart. I love having direct access to the chip and needing to understand the hardware architecture, as opposed to the internals of an interpreter, to write well-working and well-performing code.</p><p>That's the cliff-notes on my technical background. As a person I'm friendly and easy to get along with. I like the phrase &quot;Have strong opinions, weakly held&quot;.</p><p>I enjoy backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, rock-climbing, hiking, biking and beer! I live in a small town called Nelson in British Columbia, Canada and would strongly prefer to work remotely. I've been working remotely for several years for companies in the SF bay area and love it!</p><p>If you think I could be a good fit for your team and would like to chat I can be contacted by email at jesse.hughes.it@gmail.com</p>",

This job is a great fit for pragmatic programmers with a functional bend.</p><p>Over the last few years, we’ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects, built full stack solutions leveraging Elixir and Phoenix, constructed models and data pipelines with Python and delighted our users utilizing in React, Native iOS and Android.</p><p>We do a lot.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p><p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions.</p><p>At Very, there is a never-ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year, we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p><p>You’ll spend the bulk your week (35 hours) designing and developing on a product or platform for one of our clients. The remainder can be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and/or participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p><p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p><p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools/platforms:</p><p><strong>Our Current Tooling</strong></p><ul><li>React &amp; React Native</li><li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li><li>Java &amp; Kotlin</li><li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Python</li><li>Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</li><li>Serverless</li><li>AWS</li></ul><p>You don’t need to be an expert in these tools, but familiarity is a plus. Our build teams operate with a very high degree of collaboration, so you will definitely have run-ins with these stacks throughout your time here.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p><p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, <strong>you can expect to make somewhere between $40,000 and $60,000 upon joining the company. </strong></p><p><strong>This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. </strong>We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in the continental United States. Thanks!</p><p><strong>Why work at Very?</strong></p><p>It’s not just about perks. It’s about solving tough problems and constantly learning, collaborating, and improving.</p><p><strong>What We Value</strong></p><p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p><p>We believe in empowering individuals to make an impact. Instead of having an org chart, we distribute authority through an approach called holacracy.</p><p><strong>Fairness</strong></p><p>We practice radical transparency, providing insight into all levels of the company, from financial performance to individual compensation.</p><p><strong>Balance</strong></p><p>We believe people do their best work when they have fulfilling lives outside of work. Ship great products, and we’ll give you the space to live your life.</p><p><strong>Yeah, but what about the perks?</strong></p><p><strong>Work where you want</strong></p><p><strong>Work from anywhere. Your home, our beautiful Chattanooga office, a co-working space, on the road, you name it. If you feel like moving, you don’t have to change jobs.</strong></p><p><strong>Level up your skills</strong></p><p>We’ll cover $2,000 annually for you to attend conferences, take courses, or learn something new. Plus we pay 100% of travel and registration costs for employees who speak at conferences.

As more and more businesses move operations to the cloud, Fastly is well positioned to continue increasing CDN, cloud networking and cloud security market share with edge cloud services that reach beyond content delivery.</p><p>We’re building a better Internet. Come join us.</p><p><strong>Senior Software Engineer – Isolation</strong></p><p>At Fastly, our technology stretches from front-end web development, down through to kernel work. We have many large C codebases where maximizing execution speed, and minimizing resource consumption, and maintaining security guarantees are critical to our business.</p><p>The isolation team is creating a compiler collection and runtime for software fault isolation of untrusted code. The tools this team creates are used by others at Fastly to ensure that our C codebases can grow in features and complexity without compromising on either security or performance.</p><p>Compiler-related work is often undervalued.

You know your way around binutils and gdb.</li><li>Enough of a background in compilers to give a strong practical and theoretical footing to your work.

You’ll be a good candidate if you have experience in SOME of these:</strong></p><ul><li>You have written or contributed to a compiler or operating system, even a toy or research one.</li><li>You have used Rust, or some of the languages that influenced the design of Rust.</li><li>You have spent a few dozen hours of your life waiting for GCC or LLVM to build. You’ve played with features that aren’t properly documented and read the source code and mailing lists to figure out how they work.</li><li>You have used a handful of IDLs, and can have a conversation about what tradeoffs they made.</li><li>You have used fuzzers, property-based testing tools, SMT solvers, or formal methods.</li><li>You enjoy functional programming but are no longer a zealot.</li><li>You have audited C software for vulnerabilities, or worked with auditors of your own C code to correct issues.</li><li>You have participated in security capture-the-flag games, or reverse engineered software or hardware.</li></ul><p><strong>Why Fastly?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>&nbsp;<strong>huge</strong>&nbsp;<strong>impact.</strong>&nbsp;Fastly is a small company with a big reach. Not only do our customers have a tremendous user base, but we also support a growing number of open source projects and initiatives. Outside of code, employees are encouraged to share causes close to their heart with others so we can help lend a supportive hand.</li><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>love</strong>&nbsp;<strong>distributed</strong>&nbsp;<strong>teams.</strong>&nbsp;Fastly’s home-base is in San Francisco, but we have multiple offices and&nbsp;<strong>employees sprinkled around the globe. In fact, 50% of our employees work outside of SF! An international remote culture is in our DNA.</strong></li><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>care</strong>&nbsp;<strong>about</strong>&nbsp;<strong>you.</strong>&nbsp;Fastly works hard to create a positive environment for our employees, and we think your life outside of work is important too. We support our teams with great benefits like up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave, options for free medical/dental/vision plans, and an open vacation program that enables our folks to take the time they need to recharge (some benefits may vary by location).</li><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>value</strong>&nbsp;<strong>diversity.</strong>&nbsp;Growing and maintaining our inclusive and diverse team matters to us.

    "content": "*Yoto*\n<br>Yoto is a company founded by experienced entrepreneurs that aims to change the way children access audio content. We are building a safe, digital audio platform made for kids from the ground up, and featuring a curated library of music, stories, radio, podcasts and learning activities for children aged 2-8. Yoto features its own carefully connected smart speaker that children control with physical cards.\n<br>\n<br>Designed by families for families and inspired by Montessori principles, Yoto gives youngsters autonomy over what they listen to or play – from their favourite nursery rhymes to learning the alphabet through phonics, and provides an exciting alternative to excessive screen time.\n<br>\n<br>Yoto launched its first hardware product on &quot;Kickstarter&quot;:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yoto/yoto-a-clever-speaker-for-kids in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and has won a Red Dot Design award. The product shipped for Christmas 2018 to a great customer reaction. We have already partnered with the Roald Dahl company - to create new content based on his classic stories - as well as publishers including Hachette, HarperCollins, Naxos, StoryNory and more. Luke Kelly, grandson of Roald Dahl and MD of the Roald Dahl Story Company, is on our board.\n<br>\n<br>*About us*\n<br>We’re a small, creative team with a passion for technology, education, music, audiobooks and podcasts. We’ve built companies at scale before (dotmusic - sold to Yahoo, 7digital - IPO in 2014, Bouncepad, and Frukt - sold to Interpublic) and we’re bringing that experience to the world of audio entertainment and learning for children.\n<br>\n<br>As a start-up, we don’t revel in office politics and endless meetings, giving you more time to get on with the more fun part of the job. We all love what we do.\n<br>\n<br>*The position*\n<br>We’re looking for experienced FreeRTOS developer to be in charge of design and development of firmware and apps running on Yoto players.\n<br>\n<br>We strongly value a healthy work-life balance.
