This role will be part of a small new team, but will work remotely and collaboratively across the organization and movement ensuring our systems enable users to document, create, share and seek the knowledge contained in Wikimedia Projects while making sure our systems are resilient, secure and scalable. Our work is open-source and you can find the work of our engineering teams <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. An example of the type of work this new team will facilitate is the output of the <a href='https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Frontend_Architecture_Working_Group' rel='nofollow'>Frontend Architecture Working Group,</a> a committee which recently chose a standard JavaScript framework and a plan to migrate there from our homegrown <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia/oojs-ui' rel='nofollow'>OOUI</a>. This work we accomplish is strongly guided by our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/values/' rel='nofollow'>organizational values</a>. We try to use the right tool for the job and we write code in a variety of languages: <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki' rel='nofollow'>PHP</a>, <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia/eventlogging' rel='nofollow'>Python</a>, <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia/eventgate' rel='nofollow'>Javascript </a>and even the occasional <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia/analytics-refinery-source/blob/master/refinery-job/src/main/scala/org/wikimedia/analytics/refinery/job/ClickstreamBuilder.scala' rel='nofollow'>Scala</a>.</p><p>A strong candidate has a deep commitment to collective reasoning, strengthening the argumentation of others and asking questions. You have worked on multiple high scale data systems both in an engineering and design capacity.

You are excited about big end goals, but even more delighted about figuring out the path to get there.</p><p><strong>You are responsible for:</strong></p><ul><li>Collaborate with engineers, product managers and other system owners within the Wikimedia Foundation and its partners to model and design a target architecture for Wikimedia and path to get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Prototype and experiment in conjunction with software engineers to test assumptions and obtain feedback on potential system designs</li><li>Develop and lead internal workshops to gain insight into domains, workflows and other system needs.&nbsp;</li><li>Contribute to implementation plans in conjunction with development teams</li><li>Socialize and communicate architecture designs across Wikimedia stakeholders</li></ul><p><strong>Skills and Experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Looking for 3 to 7 years working in an architecture role.</li><li>Ability to communicate and facilitate across cross functional groups.&nbsp;</li><li>Portfolio of tools for modeling the domains and flows, especially interfaces and communications across system components</li><li>Experienced implementing and designing systems. Mostly recently you have worked in an architecture role. Whatever your title has been in the past most recently you have designed high traffic data focused systems.&nbsp;</li><li>You have experience migrating legacy systems to modern architectures</li><li>You have worked on event driven, incremental and service oriented architectures</li><li>You are experienced implementing data technologies such as relational databases, NoSQL or event streaming.&nbsp;</li><li>You have created a variety of architecture artifacts, choosing the right delivery for the audience</li><li>Deeply committed to collaborative work and strengthening ideas together</li><li>Know at least one programming language well, but have knowledge in a variety of languages. You are comfortable with compiled and scripting languages.</li><li>Able to stay motivated while working towards a long-term goal and celebrate successes along the way.&nbsp;</li><li>B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science, related field or equivalent in related work experience.
