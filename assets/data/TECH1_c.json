The scale of data that comes from that collaboration is immense — 34M+ developers, 2M+ organizations, 100M+ repositories, 1.1B+ contributions, and 200M+ pull requests in 2018.</p><p>Helping developers navigate and understand all of that data is a core part of GitHub’s mission, and an area with potential we’ve only begun to realize. We have high aspirations for how we can help developers understand and navigate code, and for making collaboration more seamless. The foundation for these efforts is Search.</p><p>Search at GitHub, a feature used by millions, is a vital piece of the puzzle, and one which has been underserved over recent years. We are currently reinventing the way that developers can search on the platform — re-thinking everything from the experience to the system architecture supporting it.</p><p>Engineers on the search team will work on challenges of scale, flexibility, and algorithm design to create novel systems to support a new search experience. One that makes development more powerful and more accessible to the increasing population of people taking part in software development.</p><p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll get to work on challenging problems like building the distributed systems that handle search for the world’s largest source code host.</li><li>You’ll play a major role in the design and implementation of our new search platform.</li><li>Users have some very strong opinions about GitHub search — You’ll have a chance to make a bunch of developers’ lives better!</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Writing robust, maintainable code for distributed backend search systems.</li><li>Building the backend components needed to allow users to search across a variety of content types.</li><li>Working with monitoring and automation tools to ensure the availability of our Search systems.</li><li>Providing feedback and code reviews to your peers in a sensible and empathetic way.</li></ul><p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li>Proficiency in Go.</li><li>Experience building, scaling, and maintaining distributed systems.</li><li>Experience making technical decisions accounting for trade-offs.</li><li>Strong communication skills – you speak, and write, your mind well. We’re a distributed team so we’re extra mindful about communication.</li></ul><p><strong>Preferred Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Experience working remotely in a distributed company.</strong></li><li>Experience building and scaling distributed services in Java, Go or C++.</li><li>Experience working in Ruby</li><li>Experience working on a dedicated Search team.</li><li>Experience in information retrieval systems for source code.</li><li>Knowledge of operations practices: monitoring, alerting, metrics, and automation.</li><li>Experience diagnosing and resolving performance problems in complex software systems.</li></ul><p><strong>Who We Are:</strong></p><p>GitHub is the developer company. Over 40 million people use GitHub to build amazing things together across 100 million repositories. We make it easier for developers to be developers: to work together, to solve challenging problems, to create the world’s most important technologies. We foster a collaborative community that can come together as individuals and in teams to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.</p><p><strong>Leadership Principles:</strong></p><ul><li>Customer Obsessed</li><li>Trust by Default</li><li>Ship to Learn</li><li>Own the Outcome</li><li>Growth Mindset</li><li>Global Product, Global Team</li><li>Anything is Possible</li><li>Practice Kindness</li></ul><p><strong>Why You Should Join:</strong></p><p>At GitHub, we constantly strive to create an environment that allows our employees (Hubbers) to do the best work of their lives. We’ve designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily. The other half of our Hubbers work remotely in 18 countries across the globe.</p><p>We are also committed to keeping Hubbers healthy, motivated, focused and creative. We’ve designed our top-notch benefits program with these goals in mind. In a nutshell, we’ve built a place where we truly love working, we think you will too.</p><p>GitHub is made up of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and lifestyles. We embrace diversity and invite applications from people of all walks of life. We don’t discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, disability, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences. Also, if you have a disability, please let us know if there’s any way we can make the interview process better for you; we’re happy to accommodate!</p><p>Please note that benefits vary by country, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask your Talent Partner.</p><p>#LI-POST</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1875361' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip. Joining our team means you are helping us fight the good fight against expense reports that suck!</p><p>We are expanding into the UK market and its very early stage for our London based team. Help shape the team that will launch our global domination of expense reports and maintain a standard of excellence around the world.</p><p>Joining our team means you will be working in our fast paced environment and you are fearless of our next big challenge. Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most discussed perk is our offshore where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we are heading to Vietnam, do you want to join?</p><h3>About You</h3><p>Whether you’re building features like calendar integrations, importing credit card transactions, or pulling information from receipts, you’re self-driven and collaborative. You’re an autonomous individual who is passionate about making code beautiful and effective, and you’re open to working with other engineers and designers to make dreams into reality.</p><p>As a Full Stack Engineer, your responsibilities include:</p><ul><li><p>Squashing bugs: big, small, and hairy!</p></li><li><p>Building features like accounting integrations, travel budgets, and more.</p></li><li><p>Guiding and enabling others in the technical organization: we'll share our editor tricks, dotfiles and productive workflow. Share yours!</p></li><li><p>Asking questions about things you don’t understand and challenging the status quo</p></li></ul><p>For the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:</p><ul><li><p>Has experience writing real-world software to solve real-world solutions.</p></li><li><p>Communicates well, both in the code (WE &lt;3 COMMENTS!) as well as with our team and industry partners</p></li><li><p>Is a natural problem solver</p></li><li><p>Wants to develop and grow their skills in programming and leadership within the organization</p></li></ul><p>While we use a number of different technologies and languages, for this role we are looking for people who already have a strong understanding of JavaScript, PHP, C++, Java, algorithms, and design patterns. This position is the foundation for launching a career with Expensify, with the expectation you’ll carry these skills into new domains.</p><h3>Compensation &amp; Benefits</h3><ul><li><p>Annual Pension Contribution</p></li><li><p>100% Coverage for Dental/Vision Premiums</p></li><li><p>Free Lunch</p></li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?</p></li><li><p>What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?</p></li><li><p>What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?</p></li><li><p>How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</p></li></ol><h3>Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyway! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href='mailto:jobs@expensify.com' rel='nofollow'>jobs@expensify.com</a>. We're excited to hear from you!</h3>",

The company was built on the concept of providing an inexpensive PC-based CAM system at a time when most other systems were expensive CAD-oriented products. CNC Software was one of the first companies to introduce CAD/CAM software designed for both the machinist and the engineer, providing a practical solution to both markets. While the original version of Mastercam focused on two-dimensional (2D) CAM, it was also one of the first micro-based CAM packages to include CAD capabilities. With Mastercam, the engineer could construct his or her own parts quickly and easily as well as machine them, for an affordable price.</p><p><strong>CNC Software Today </strong></p><p>Today, the CNC Software, Inc. corporate headquarters and training facility is located in a company-owned 53,000 sq. ft. environmentally friendly building in Tolland, Connecticut.&nbsp; In addition to the 150 employees located at our corporate facility, the Company has another 50 employees who work remotely for the Company across the United States and Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The real backbone of the over 260,000 installation-strong Mastercam community is our global reseller network. Some of these experts have been with CNC Software since the very beginning. They've helped build shops from the ground up, and have developed a true &quot;partnership&quot; with our customers, offering advice, strategy, and experience to Mastercam users around the world.</p><p><strong>Strengths and Stability </strong></p><p>As an industry leader for over 35 years, CNC Software prides itself on meeting the demanding needs of its customers by providing excellent products at affordable prices. We adhere to our strategy of combining superior software programming with practical shop floor experience. We have remained at the forefront of CAD/CAM technology by listening to our customers' needs, being accessible, and most of all, being dedicated to our customers. CNC Software has provided CAD/CAM solutions to over 250,000 installations worldwide in the mold making, automotive, aerospace, and consumer industries.</p><p><strong>Broad Market Reach with an Eye to the Future </strong></p><p>Mastercam offers solutions for designers and NC programmers in a spectrum of industries, including milling, turning, wire EDM, router programming, plasma cutting, lasers, and 3D design and drafting. CNC Software's customers range from one-person job shops to Fortune 100 manufacturers. The same software that is utilized by corporations such as Boeing, IBM, and Sikorsky is still affordable enough for the small job shop. To ensure a new generation of trained metal and woodworking personnel, Mastercam is available to educational institutions at sizable discounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As CNC Software, Inc. and its flagship Mastercam continue to grow and expand into new markets and technology, our focus remains on our customers.

We unify collaboration technologies like voice, video, and messaging on a single cloud-based platform so users can experience greater efficiency and less hassle each workday. The company is growing rapidly as we move full steam ahead toward our anticipated IPO. Now’s the time to bring your passion and expertise to our Fuze team!</p><p>Our customers use our software across a variety of platforms including Windows, OS X, iOS, Android and web. We build our software to work and provide a great experience across all of these platforms. Whenever possible we use open source technologies like WebRTC or OPAL. Where it makes sense we build our own software stacks. The Real Time Communications team also builds linux-based microservices that provide audio, video, screen share, content, recording and interoperability gateway functions. These microservices use a combination of REST APIs and IETF standards based protocols to provide functionality to our desktop, mobile and web-based clients. These microservices are built with scalability, resiliency and performance in mind.</p><p>The primary task of the Real Time Communications team is to build the heart of our product — the software stacks that power the audio and video communications within our product. This team works across both the client and backend stacks. Within this team you will get exposure to a broad range of technologies and challenges.</p><p>As much as possible we develop cross platform code — sharing code across clients and sometimes between the clients and various backend services. We believe strongly in modularity and code reuse. As we’re developing cross platform code that is often times CPU intensive and performance critical we tend to use C++ as our language of choice for code that requires portability between the clients and servers.</p><p>In this position you will be responsible for owning, developing and maintaining key components in our client media framework or the backend media services. You will develop services that are deployed globally and run in mixed environments including our own datacenters and AWS. You will be responsible for making key technical recommendations and then executing on your recommendations.You will be responsible for coming up with and implementing innovative solution to difficult problems. You must be hands on and have a passion for developing software.</p><p><strong>What You Will Need:</strong></p><ul><li>Expert C++ coding skills with minimum of 7 years experience</li><li>Experience with streaming media protocols (SIP, SDP, H.323)</li><li>Experience developing real-time audio/video communication systems leveraging RTP/RTCP and audio codecs such as Opus, G.711, G.722</li><li>Experience developing networking software including working with socket level programming and UDP/TCP</li><li>Experience developing and shipping high quality applications for OS X, Windows, iOS or Android is an asset</li><li>Experience building production Linux based services is an asset</li><li>Experience with WebRTC</li><li>Experience with Go and/or Python is a plus</li><li>Understanding of the various trade offs when dealing with real-time media</li><li>Drive, passion, dedication and a good attitude</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.fuze.com/careers#!/job/1713684' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

But loopers are hard to use in concerts: they’re totally manual, meaning you have to pay attention to playing your part and operating the looper. This means they’re risky, and for live performances, risky is bad – very bad.<br> The solution to this is zenAud.io ALK, which completely reinvents live looping.

The company was built on the concept of providing an inexpensive PC-based CAM system at a time when most other systems were expensive CAD-oriented products. CNC Software was one of the first companies to introduce CAD/CAM software designed for both the machinist and the engineer, providing a practical solution to both markets. While the original version of Mastercam focused on two-dimensional (2D) CAM, it was also one of the first micro-based CAM packages to include CAD capabilities. With Mastercam, the engineer could construct his or her own parts quickly and easily as well as machine them, for an affordable price.</p><p><strong>CNC Software Today </strong></p><p>Today, the CNC Software, Inc. corporate headquarters and training facility is located in a company-owned 53,000 sq. ft. environmentally friendly building in Tolland, Connecticut.&nbsp; In addition to the 150 employees located at our corporate facility, the Company has another 50 employees who work remotely for the Company across the United States and Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The real backbone of the over 260,000 installation-strong Mastercam community is our global reseller network. Some of these experts have been with CNC Software since the very beginning. They've helped build shops from the ground up, and have developed a true &quot;partnership&quot; with our customers, offering advice, strategy, and experience to Mastercam users around the world.</p><p><strong>Strengths and Stability </strong></p><p>As an industry leader for over 35 years, CNC Software prides itself on meeting the demanding needs of its customers by providing excellent products at affordable prices. We adhere to our strategy of combining superior software programming with practical shop floor experience. We have remained at the forefront of CAD/CAM technology by listening to our customers' needs, being accessible, and most of all, being dedicated to our customers. CNC Software has provided CAD/CAM solutions to over 250,000 installations worldwide in the mold making, automotive, aerospace, and consumer industries.</p><p><strong>Broad Market Reach with an Eye to the Future </strong></p><p>Mastercam offers solutions for designers and NC programmers in a spectrum of industries, including milling, turning, wire EDM, router programming, plasma cutting, lasers, and 3D design and drafting. CNC Software's customers range from one-person job shops to Fortune 100 manufacturers.
