We are an innovative campaigning organization that supports people throughout the country to take action through driving impactful campaigns that influence the behavior of people and institutions, the outcomes of elections, and expand the realities of what’s possible. We organize to challenge entrenched power, while pursuing economic, racial, and social justice and a vision of a country in which everyone can thrive.</p><p>MoveOn has a particularly important role to play in the Trump era. We are working to defeat Donald Trump and the GOP in 2020 by building a powerful, multiracial, and economic populist movement that will give voters something to vote<em>&nbsp;for</em>, not just against and we’re also working to defend communities that are on the front lines of Trump and GOP attacks, including immigrants, people of color, the LGBTQ community, and women. In service of that mission, in 2019, 2020, and beyond, MoveOn will drive impactful, movement-connected, multichannel, nimble campaigns aimed at impact.</p><p>Our MoveOn team is made up of three different entities. MoveOn Civic Action, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, focuses on education and advocacy, driving powerful campaigns that engage a mass public and building the progressive movement. MoveOn Political Action, a 527 federal PAC, is focused on demonstrating MoveOn members’ power at the ballot box and electing candidates who reflect MoveOn members’ values. MoveOn Education Fund, a 501(c)(3) organization, was founded in 2018 to educate the public and promote efforts critical to supporting a democracy dedicated to the common good, focusing on public policy issues such as racial justice, foreign policy, and the influence of money in politics.</p><p><strong>About the Position</strong></p><p>We are seeking a dynamic, resourceful, and well-organized Development Officer to help continue to build our major gifts program. This frontline fundraiser will manage donor relationships and sustain the pipeline for major gifts and planned giving. MoveOn’s major donor fundraising, initiated in 2015, complements our small, grassroots donor base that served as the organization’s exclusive source of income for decades and remains the majority of MoveOn’s revenue. The major donor program has quickly become an important asset to help MoveOn meet the escalating challenges of this historical moment, raising more than $15 million in less than four years while complying with the highest levels of transparency and reporting. The Development Officer will help lead the next phase of growth as we expand the Development team and deepen our work in this area.</p><p>This job requires professionalism, patience, positivity, flexibility, organization, and calm under fire in the midst of David vs. Goliath battles to defend our democracy and defend our core values from unprecedented attacks. This position is crucial to the success of MoveOn and will need strong communication skills to remain in sync with the entirety of the organization.

We envisioned a better way to harness the power of open source, and in 2008, started a company to automate the modern software supply chain.</p><p>We are Sonatype, and we have assembled a world class team of employees,investors, and partners. We’re proud to be recognized as a Deloitte Technology Fast 500 company for 2019. With more than 100,000 installations and counting, Nexus products are helping modern development organizations intelligently source, manage, assemble, and maintain open source and third-party components, so they can improve the quality, security, and speed of their software supply chains.</p><p>We’re curious and we’re constantly innovating without fear of failure.

This role will be part of a small new team, but will work remotely and collaboratively across the organization and movement ensuring our systems enable users to document, create, share and seek the knowledge contained in Wikimedia Projects while making sure our systems are resilient, secure and scalable. Our work is open-source and you can find the work of our engineering teams <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. An example of the type of work this new team will facilitate is the output of the <a href='https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Frontend_Architecture_Working_Group' rel='nofollow'>Frontend Architecture Working Group,</a> a committee which recently chose a standard JavaScript framework and a plan to migrate there from our homegrown <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia/oojs-ui' rel='nofollow'>OOUI</a>. This work we accomplish is strongly guided by our <a href='https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/values/' rel='nofollow'>organizational values</a>. We try to use the right tool for the job and we write code in a variety of languages: <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki' rel='nofollow'>PHP</a>, <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia/eventlogging' rel='nofollow'>Python</a>, <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia/eventgate' rel='nofollow'>Javascript </a>and even the occasional <a href='https://github.com/wikimedia/analytics-refinery-source/blob/master/refinery-job/src/main/scala/org/wikimedia/analytics/refinery/job/ClickstreamBuilder.scala' rel='nofollow'>Scala</a>.</p><p>A strong candidate has a deep commitment to collective reasoning, strengthening the argumentation of others and asking questions. You have worked on multiple high scale data systems both in an engineering and design capacity. This experience includes building systems in modern architectures but also transitioning legacy monolithic systems to a more modular approach. You are excited about big end goals, but even more delighted about figuring out the path to get there.</p><p><strong>You are responsible for:</strong></p><ul><li>Collaborate with engineers, product managers and other system owners within the Wikimedia Foundation and its partners to model and design a target architecture for Wikimedia and path to get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Prototype and experiment in conjunction with software engineers to test assumptions and obtain feedback on potential system designs</li><li>Develop and lead internal workshops to gain insight into domains, workflows and other system needs.&nbsp;</li><li>Contribute to implementation plans in conjunction with development teams</li><li>Socialize and communicate architecture designs across Wikimedia stakeholders</li></ul><p><strong>Skills and Experience:</strong></p><ul><li>Looking for 3 to 7 years working in an architecture role.</li><li>Ability to communicate and facilitate across cross functional groups.&nbsp;</li><li>Portfolio of tools for modeling the domains and flows, especially interfaces and communications across system components</li><li>Experienced implementing and designing systems. Mostly recently you have worked in an architecture role. Whatever your title has been in the past most recently you have designed high traffic data focused systems.&nbsp;</li><li>You have experience migrating legacy systems to modern architectures</li><li>You have worked on event driven, incremental and service oriented architectures</li><li>You are experienced implementing data technologies such as relational databases, NoSQL or event streaming.&nbsp;</li><li>You have created a variety of architecture artifacts, choosing the right delivery for the audience</li><li>Deeply committed to collaborative work and strengthening ideas together</li><li>Know at least one programming language well, but have knowledge in a variety of languages. You are comfortable with compiled and scripting languages.</li><li>Able to stay motivated while working towards a long-term goal and celebrate successes along the way.&nbsp;</li><li>B.S. or M.S. in Computer Science, related field or equivalent in related work experience.

Our vision is a world in which every single human can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. We believe that everyone has the potential to contribute something to our shared knowledge, and that everyone should be able to access that knowledge, free of interference. We host the Wikimedia projects, build software experiences for reading, contributing, and sharing Wikimedia content, support the volunteer communities and partners who make Wikimedia possible, and advocate for policies that enable Wikimedia and free knowledge to thrive.
