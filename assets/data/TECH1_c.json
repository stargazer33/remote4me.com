We are an innovative campaigning organization that supports people throughout the country to take action through driving impactful campaigns that influence the behavior of people and institutions, the outcomes of elections, and expand the realities of what’s possible. We organize to challenge entrenched power, while pursuing economic, racial, and social justice and a vision of a country in which everyone can thrive.</p><p>MoveOn has a particularly important role to play in the Trump era. We are working to defeat Donald Trump and the GOP in 2020 by building a powerful, multiracial, and economic populist movement that will give voters something to vote<em>&nbsp;for</em>, not just against and we’re also working to defend communities that are on the front lines of Trump and GOP attacks, including immigrants, people of color, the LGBTQ community, and women. In service of that mission, in 2019, 2020, and beyond, MoveOn will drive impactful, movement-connected, multichannel, nimble campaigns aimed at impact.</p><p>Our MoveOn team is made up of three different entities. MoveOn Civic Action, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, focuses on education and advocacy, driving powerful campaigns that engage a mass public and building the progressive movement. MoveOn Political Action, a 527 federal PAC, is focused on demonstrating MoveOn members’ power at the ballot box and electing candidates who reflect MoveOn members’ values. MoveOn Education Fund, a 501(c)(3) organization, was founded in 2018 to educate the public and promote efforts critical to supporting a democracy dedicated to the common good, focusing on public policy issues such as racial justice, foreign policy, and the influence of money in politics.</p><p><strong>About the Position</strong></p><p>We are seeking a dynamic, resourceful, and well-organized Development Officer to help continue to build our major gifts program. This frontline fundraiser will manage donor relationships and sustain the pipeline for major gifts and planned giving. MoveOn’s major donor fundraising, initiated in 2015, complements our small, grassroots donor base that served as the organization’s exclusive source of income for decades and remains the majority of MoveOn’s revenue. The major donor program has quickly become an important asset to help MoveOn meet the escalating challenges of this historical moment, raising more than $15 million in less than four years while complying with the highest levels of transparency and reporting. The Development Officer will help lead the next phase of growth as we expand the Development team and deepen our work in this area.</p><p>This job requires professionalism, patience, positivity, flexibility, organization, and calm under fire in the midst of David vs. Goliath battles to defend our democracy and defend our core values from unprecedented attacks.

We’re proud to be recognized as a Deloitte Technology Fast 500 company for 2019. With more than 100,000 installations and counting, Nexus products are helping modern development organizations intelligently source, manage, assemble, and maintain open source and third-party components, so they can improve the quality, security, and speed of their software supply chains.</p><p>We’re curious and we’re constantly innovating without fear of failure.
