The C++ spec weighs a lot, so I'm hesitant to call myself an expert, but I have a good working knowledge of the languages. For a previous employer I worked on a commercial Windows IDE for ~3 years.</p><p>I've been working on the foundations of a 3D game engine for ~3 years, which has taught me a great deal about C, systems and graphics programming on both Win32 and Linux. I chose to build it without libraries (Handmade Hero style) which began as a learning exercise, but ended up teaching me to value simplicity much more than I expected.</p><p>I can configure and maintain webservers, proxies and load balancers having worked with the web for 10 years.</p><p>I have a good understanding of the Linux network stack and APIs at the systems level - I've worked on several custom TCP + UDP protocols in the past.</p><p>I love building tools. Sometimes I feel like I was made to build tools. I build all kinds of tools - tools for computers, tools for automotive maintenance, tools for making tools. I've been building a game engine, which I would consider a collection of tools, for years and I still enjoy working on it.</p><p>Lastly, and I think this is interrelated with the tools thing, I'm a systems programmer at heart. I love having direct access to the chip and needing to understand the hardware architecture, as opposed to the internals of an interpreter, to write well-working and well-performing code.</p><p>That's the cliff-notes on my technical background. As a person I'm friendly and easy to get along with. I like the phrase &quot;Have strong opinions, weakly held&quot;.</p><p>I enjoy backcountry skiing, snowmobiling, rock-climbing, hiking, biking and beer! I live in a small town called Nelson in British Columbia, Canada and would strongly prefer to work remotely. I've been working remotely for several years for companies in the SF bay area and love it!</p><p>If you think I could be a good fit for your team and would like to chat I can be contacted by email at jesse.hughes.it@gmail.com</p>",

This job is a great fit for pragmatic programmers with a functional bend.</p><p>Over the last few years, we’ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects, built full stack solutions leveraging Elixir and Phoenix, constructed models and data pipelines with Python and delighted our users utilizing in React, Native iOS and Android.</p><p>We do a lot.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p><p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions.</p><p>At Very, there is a never-ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year, we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p><p>You’ll spend the bulk your week (35 hours) designing and developing on a product or platform for one of our clients. The remainder can be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and/or participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p><p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p><p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools/platforms:</p><p><strong>Our Current Tooling</strong></p><ul><li>React &amp; React Native</li><li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li><li>Java &amp; Kotlin</li><li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Python</li><li>Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</li><li>Serverless</li><li>AWS</li></ul><p>You don’t need to be an expert in these tools, but familiarity is a plus. Our build teams operate with a very high degree of collaboration, so you will definitely have run-ins with these stacks throughout your time here.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p><p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, <strong>you can expect to make somewhere between $40,000 and $60,000 upon joining the company. </strong></p><p><strong>This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. </strong>We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in the continental United States. Thanks!</p><p><strong>Why work at Very?</strong></p><p>It’s not just about perks. It’s about solving tough problems and constantly learning, collaborating, and improving.</p><p><strong>What We Value</strong></p><p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p><p>We believe in empowering individuals to make an impact. Instead of having an org chart, we distribute authority through an approach called holacracy.</p><p><strong>Fairness</strong></p><p>We practice radical transparency, providing insight into all levels of the company, from financial performance to individual compensation.</p><p><strong>Balance</strong></p><p>We believe people do their best work when they have fulfilling lives outside of work. Ship great products, and we’ll give you the space to live your life.</p><p><strong>Yeah, but what about the perks?</strong></p><p><strong>Work where you want</strong></p><p><strong>Work from anywhere. Your home, our beautiful Chattanooga office, a co-working space, on the road, you name it. If you feel like moving, you don’t have to change jobs.</strong></p><p><strong>Level up your skills</strong></p><p>We’ll cover $2,000 annually for you to attend conferences, take courses, or learn something new. Plus we pay 100% of travel and registration costs for employees who speak at conferences. We also reserve time for internal projects and professional development.</p><p><strong>Paid parental leave</strong></p><p>When you welcome a new baby, we encourage you to take time off to bond with your child. We offer generous maternity and paternity leave for all new parents.</p><p><strong>Medical and fitness</strong></p><p>We believe that healthy bodies power healthy minds. We have many health, vision, and dental plans available through UHC, and we currently contribute a large portion to each plan. We also pay up to $70/month for your gym membership, yoga classes, or whatever you do to stay fit.</p><p><strong>401k match</strong></p><p>We match $1 for every $3 contributed up to $18,000.</p><p><strong>Home office stipend</strong></p><p>All remote employees may expense up to $60/month of their Internet service costs. Additionally, remote employees get a $1,000 home office stipend in their first year and $200/year for each subsequent year.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.verypossible.com/careers/senior-sofware-enginer-latam' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Come join us.</p><p><strong>Senior Software Engineer – Isolation</strong></p><p>At Fastly, our technology stretches from front-end web development, down through to kernel work. We have many large C codebases where maximizing execution speed, and minimizing resource consumption, and maintaining security guarantees are critical to our business.</p><p>The isolation team is creating a compiler collection and runtime for software fault isolation of untrusted code. The tools this team creates are used by others at Fastly to ensure that our C codebases can grow in features and complexity without compromising on either security or performance.</p><p>Compiler-related work is often undervalued.

You’ve played with features that aren’t properly documented and read the source code and mailing lists to figure out how they work.</li><li>You have used a handful of IDLs, and can have a conversation about what tradeoffs they made.</li><li>You have used fuzzers, property-based testing tools, SMT solvers, or formal methods.</li><li>You enjoy functional programming but are no longer a zealot.</li><li>You have audited C software for vulnerabilities, or worked with auditors of your own C code to correct issues.</li><li>You have participated in security capture-the-flag games, or reverse engineered software or hardware.</li></ul><p><strong>Why Fastly?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>&nbsp;<strong>huge</strong>&nbsp;<strong>impact.</strong>&nbsp;Fastly is a small company with a big reach.

We support our teams with great benefits like up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave, options for free medical/dental/vision plans, and an open vacation program that enables our folks to take the time they need to recharge (some benefits may vary by location).</li><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>value</strong>&nbsp;<strong>diversity.</strong>&nbsp;Growing and maintaining our inclusive and diverse team matters to us. We are committed to being a company where our employees feel comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work and have the ability to be successful — every day.</li><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>are</strong>&nbsp;<strong>passionate.</strong>&nbsp;Fastly is chock full of passionate people and we’re not one size fits all’.

    "content": "*Yoto*\n<br>Yoto is a company founded by experienced entrepreneurs that aims to change the way children access audio content. We are building a safe, digital audio platform made for kids from the ground up, and featuring a curated library of music, stories, radio, podcasts and learning activities for children aged 2-8. Yoto features its own carefully connected smart speaker that children control with physical cards.\n<br>\n<br>Designed by families for families and inspired by Montessori principles, Yoto gives youngsters autonomy over what they listen to or play – from their favourite nursery rhymes to learning the alphabet through phonics, and provides an exciting alternative to excessive screen time.\n<br>\n<br>Yoto launched its first hardware product on &quot;Kickstarter&quot;:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yoto/yoto-a-clever-speaker-for-kids in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and has won a Red Dot Design award. The product shipped for Christmas 2018 to a great customer reaction. We have already partnered with the Roald Dahl company - to create new content based on his classic stories - as well as publishers including Hachette, HarperCollins, Naxos, StoryNory and more.

By not relying on pattern matching or similar approximations, CodeSonar's static analysis engine is extraordinarily deep, finding 3-5 times more defects on average than other static analysis tools.</p>\n <p>Unlike many software development tools, such as testing tools, compilers, configuration management, etc., SAST tools can be integrated into a team's development process at any time with ease. SAST technologies like CodeSonar simply attach to your existing build environments to add analysis information to your verification process.</p>\n <p>The <strong>Research Team </strong>responds to Request for Proposals from government and other sponsors:</p>\n <p>Our expertise in software analysis and binary transformation comes from decades of experience of high-tech research with the U.S. government and other organizations. Over the past two decades, we have partnered with several groups to help solve some of the most complex software challenges that impact devices' resiliency, safety, and security. Our work has been focused in three areas:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Software Assurance:</strong>&nbsp;new techniques and technologies for analyzing and correcting software to ensure runtime integrity and prevent unplanned system breaches and failures.</li>\n  <li><strong>Software Hardening:</strong>&nbsp;technologies solely focused on system resiliency.</li>\n  <li><strong>Autonomic Computing:</strong>&nbsp;providing software systems with the ability to ‘self-protect’</li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Competitive base salaries - whether in Ithaca, Madison or remote!</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flex Time - flexible hours, ample vacation time, available day one</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Floating Holidays - flexible holidays can be taken on any day</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Healthcare -health, dental, &amp; vision; covered day one</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Annual bonuses and raises - above cost of living increases</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Generous pension plan - after 13 months of employment</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>SNACKS - plenty of free snacks!</span> </li> \n</ul>",

We are responsible for low level technologies like cluster filesystems as well as web-based frontends for monitoring and managing clusters, so we need people who are willing to learn and move around between projects and languages. We work entirely with free and open source software in upstream projects, so experience contributing to such development would be valuable, and the software we develop is used in mission critical applications so a focus on testing, test automation and software quality is also important.</p>\n <p><br>Currently, we are working on making migration to the public cloud smoother for users of our technology. This includes work on configuration management, automation, testing and monitoring, and also to work in partnership with SAP, Amazon, Microsoft and many others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n <p><br><strong>Here is a brief list of technologies and tools we work with:</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Python, Go, Ruby, Salt, Terraform, &nbsp;Prometheus, Grafana, C, C++, Autotools, Git, Pacemaker, Corosync, Bash, Perl, Ansible, Travis CI, Jenkins, Docker, Swagger, Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, Node.js,md-raid, OCFS2, Netweaver and SAP HANA.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It's a long list! If you know all of them that is amazing. None of us do! But together as a team, we cover all of these things and more.

Also, if you have experience with Agile and Devops methodologies or understand this culture and values, this can make this position right for you.&nbsp;<br>Would be great if you have experience with Cloud Providers like Azure, AWS and GCP and know the challenges to deploy Enterprise solutions there, like SAP, Oracle, or any other mission critical applications. &nbsp;If you know how to do it using a cluster, this is awesome. We work with clusters, so familiarity with high-availability is a big plus.</p>\n <br>Don't worry if you don't have any of these experiences, you can still show us your potential and motivation to learn about them!\n <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n <br>\n <strong>We Offer:</strong>\n <ul>\n  <li>Direct contact with representatives of free and open source software projects worldwide.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Regular &quot;Hackweeks&quot; and workshops on the company, department, and team levels.</li>\n  <li>Opportunities to take part in IT and open-source conferences all over the world, both as an attendee or a presenter.</li>\n  <li>Five weeks vacation.

Join our vision to transform workplace communication as we know it.</p>\n <p>Fuze is a leading unified communications as a service (UCaaS) provider focused on modernizing and simplifying day-to-day business conversations. We unify collaboration technologies like voice, video, and messaging on a single cloud-based platform so users can experience greater efficiency and less hassle each workday. The company is growing rapidly as we move full steam ahead toward our anticipated IPO. Now’s the time to bring your passion and expertise to our Fuze team!</p>\n <p>Our customers use our software across a variety of platforms including Windows, OS X, iOS, Android and web. We build our software to work and provide a great experience across all of these platforms. Whenever possible we use open source technologies like WebRTC or OPAL. Where it makes sense we build our own software stacks. The Real Time Communications team also builds linux-based microservices that provide audio, video, screen share, content, recording and interoperability gateway functions. These microservices use a combination of REST APIs and IETF standards based protocols to provide functionality to our desktop, mobile and web-based clients. These microservices are built with scalability, resiliency and performance in mind.</p>\n <p>The primary task of the Real Time Communications team is to build the heart of our product — the software stacks that power the audio and video communications within our product. This team works across both the client and backend stacks.
