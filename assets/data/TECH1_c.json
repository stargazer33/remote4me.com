Yoto features its own carefully connected smart speaker that children control with physical cards.<br /><br />Designed by families for families and inspired by Montessori principles, Yoto gives youngsters autonomy over what they listen to or play – from their favourite nursery rhymes to learning the alphabet through phonics, and provides an exciting alternative to excessive screentime.<br /><br />Yoto launched its first hardware product on Kickstarter in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and has won a Red Dot Design award.

We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip. Joining our team means you are helping us fight the good fight against expense reports that suck!</p><p>We are expanding into the UK market and its very early stage for our London based team. Help shape the team that will launch our global domination of expense reports and maintain a standard of excellence around the world.</p><p>Joining our team means you will be working in our fast paced environment and you are fearless of our next big challenge. Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most discussed perk is our offshore where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we are heading to Vietnam, do you want to join?</p><h3>About You</h3><p>Whether you’re building features like calendar integrations, importing credit card transactions, or pulling information from receipts, you’re self-driven and collaborative. You’re an autonomous individual who is passionate about making code beautiful and effective, and you’re open to working with other engineers and designers to make dreams into reality.</p><p>As a Full Stack Engineer, your responsibilities include:</p><ul><li><p>Squashing bugs: big, small, and hairy!</p></li><li><p>Building features like accounting integrations, travel budgets, and more.</p></li><li><p>Guiding and enabling others in the technical organization: we'll share our editor tricks, dotfiles and productive workflow. Share yours!</p></li><li><p>Asking questions about things you don’t understand and challenging the status quo</p></li></ul><p>For the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:</p><ul><li><p>Has experience writing real-world software to solve real-world solutions.</p></li><li><p>Communicates well, both in the code (WE &lt;3 COMMENTS!) as well as with our team and industry partners</p></li><li><p>Is a natural problem solver</p></li><li><p>Wants to develop and grow their skills in programming and leadership within the organization</p></li></ul><p>While we use a number of different technologies and languages, for this role we are looking for people who already have a strong understanding of JavaScript, PHP, C++, Java, algorithms, and design patterns. This position is the foundation for launching a career with Expensify, with the expectation you’ll carry these skills into new domains.</p><h3>Compensation &amp; Benefits</h3><ul><li><p>Annual Pension Contribution</p></li><li><p>100% Coverage for Dental/Vision Premiums</p></li><li><p>Free Lunch</p></li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?</p></li><li><p>What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?</p></li><li><p>What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?</p></li><li><p>How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</p></li></ol><h3>Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyway! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href='mailto:jobs@expensify.com' rel='nofollow'>jobs@expensify.com</a>. We're excited to hear from you!</h3>",

Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most discussed perk is our offshore where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we went to Uruguay, do you want to join?About YouWhether you’re building features like calendar integrations, importing credit card transactions, or pulling information from receipts, you’re self-driven and collaborative. You’re an autonomous individual who is passionate about making code beautiful and effective, and you’re open to working with other engineers and designers to make dreams into reality. - As a Full Stack Engineer, your responsibilities include:- Squashing bugs: big, small, and hairy!- Building features like accounting integrations, travel budgets, and more.- Guiding and enabling others in the technical organization: we'll share our editor tricks, dotfiles and productive workflow. Share yours!- Asking questions about things you don’t understand and challenging the status quoFor the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:- Has experience writing real-world software to solve real-world solutions.- Communicates well, both in the code (WE &lt;3 COMMENTS!) as well as with our team and industry partners-Is a natural problem solver- Wants to develop and grow their skills in programming and leadership within the organizationWhile we use a number of different technologies and languages, for this role we are looking for people who already have a strong understanding of JavaScript, PHP, C++, Java, algorithms, and design patterns.

See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:1. What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?2. What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?3. What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?4. How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyway! Forward your responses to the questions to jobs@expensify.com. We're excited to hear from you!",

This will involve:</p><ul><li>Designing and implementing an extendible GUI architecture, including interactive graph editor, node searcher, panel management system, visual component store, and data-controlling widgets.</li><li>Designing and implementing a modular visualization engine for Luna, allowing its users to design custom data visualizations by connecting nodes together.</li><li>Working closely with stakeholders and customers to design intuitive solutions that unobtrusively enable a fluid workflow.</li><li>Contribute to the creation of a vibrant open-source project and its ecosystem.</li></ul><p><strong>The Skills We're Looking For</strong></p><p>We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:</p><ul><li>A strong focus on both user experience and aesthetics.</li><li>Detailed knowledge of the WebGL 2.0 / OpenGL API.</li><li>Deep understanding of GPU pipeline architecture, including shader pipeline, buffers management, FBOs, VAOs, PBOs, post-processing, deferred shading.</li><li>Experience with development of high-performance shaders, in particular, knowledge of ray-marching and text rendering techniques.</li><li>Practical knowledge and experience with JavaScript and browser-related optimizations, for example, how to implement a high-performance GPU picking in WebGL.</li><li>Good understanding of the functional programming paradigm. The rendering engine will&nbsp;need bindings to purely functional programming languages, in particular to Luna and Haskell.</li></ul><p>It would be a big bonus if you had:</p><ul><li>Knowledge of Haskell, PureScript, Elm or some other strongly-typed functional programming language.</li><li>Knowledge of existing WebGL rendering libraries, like Three.js.</li><li>Experience with visual programming systems such as Houdini, Unreal Engine Blueprints, Max/MSP, Lab VIEW, or Touch Designer.</li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/261821?reset=False&amp;ra=1pO0JDyyAbZe&amp;oqs=a%3D1pO0JDyyAbZe' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Luna</h3>            <div><p><strong>Who you will work with?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>At Luna, we have a world-class team, with developers, community managers, and business developers from all walks of life and backgrounds, and work in close collaboration with industry advisers such as Robert Gentleman, the creator of the R programming language and computational biologist at 23andMe, and Edward Kmett, a skilled language designer and machine intelligence researcher at MIRI.</p><p>We firmly believe that only by working&nbsp;<em>together</em>, rather than putting our team members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Luna that can be.</p><p><strong>The Details</strong></p><p>As part of the Luna team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules, or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like.
