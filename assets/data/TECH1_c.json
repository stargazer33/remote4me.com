Der Einsatz von IoT-Lösungen in Industrie, Logistik, Gesundheitswesen und smarten Gebäuden ist derzeit noch eingeschränkt durch die begrenzte gespeicherte Energie in Batterien. Wir nutzen die Energie des Lichts - drinnen wie draußen - und betreiben mit unserer selbst entwickelten und produzierten Photovoltaikfolie IoT-Geräte für die Indoornavigation, das Asset Tracking und vielfältige Sensoranwendungen. Unsere Lösung ist nicht nur aufgrund der Wartungsfreiheit wirtschaftlicher und nachhaltiger – Der entscheidende Vorteil ist, dass wir mehr Energie als übliche Batterien bereitstellen können und somit IoT-Anwendungen ermöglichen, die bisher nicht denkbar waren.

    "content": "*Yoto*<br />Yoto is a company founded by experienced entrepreneurs that aims to change the way children access audio content. We are building a safe, digital audio platform made for kids from the ground up, and featuring a curated library of music, stories, radio, podcasts and learning activities for children aged 2-8. Yoto features its own carefully connected smart speaker that children control with physical cards.<br /><br />Designed by families for families and inspired by Montessori principles, Yoto gives youngsters autonomy over what they listen to or play – from their favourite nursery rhymes to learning the alphabet through phonics, and provides an exciting alternative to excessive screentime.<br /><br />Yoto launched its first hardware product on Kickstarter in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and has won a Red Dot Design award. The product shipped for Christmas 2018 to a great customer reaction. We have already partnered with the Roald Dahl company - to create new content based on his classic stories - as well as publishers including Hachette, HarperCollins, Naxos, StoryNory and more.

We all love what we do.<br /><br />*The position*<br />We’re looking for experienced embedded SW developer to be in charge of design and development of firmware and apps running on Yoto speakers.<br /><br />We operate under Remote First principles and we strongly value a healthy work-life balance, with flexible working hours/days to fit your lifestyle and family (most of the team has kids).<br /><br /><br />*You’ll need*<br />* Experience developing C/C++ embedded code for microcontroller based systems<br />* Excellent system level knowledge of RTOS architecture<br />* Confidence with debugging code in an embedded system<br />* Agile approach - CI/CD and fully automated testing of developed modules and systems<br />* Experience with cloud based IoT platforms, OTA updates, pub/sub messaging <br />* Good knowledge of IoT/HW protocols and interfaces - BT/BLE, RFID/NFC, WiFi; SPI, I2S, I2C,...<br />* Familiarity with electronics principles & design<br />* Solid understanding of security best practices<br /><br />We’re a very small team so you’ll get a chance to play with plenty of different things all the time - *bonus points* for any experience or desire to dig into any of the following:<br /><br />* Javascript/Node.js development<br />* Designing and building REST and/or GraphQL APIs<br />* SQL and NoSQL databases<br />* Cloud based infrastructures (AWS), serverless deployment, Docker<br />* Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana<br />* AI/Machine learning, Big Data<br /> <br />*Compensation:* <br />Full-time, part-time or freelance<br />Competitive salary and equity (tax-efficient EMI share options)<br /><br />*Benefits:* <br />Generous holidays<br />Flexible working hours<br />Workplace pension<br />Childcare Vouchers<br />Cycle to work scheme<br /><br />Drop us an email with your CV and/or links to your linkedin/github/etc profile(s)<br />",

Help shape the team that will launch our global domination of expense reports and maintain a standard of excellence around the world.</p><p>Joining our team means you will be working in our fast paced environment and you are fearless of our next big challenge. Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most discussed perk is our offshore where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we are heading to Vietnam, do you want to join?</p><h3>About You</h3><p>Whether you’re building features like calendar integrations, importing credit card transactions, or pulling information from receipts, you’re self-driven and collaborative. You’re an autonomous individual who is passionate about making code beautiful and effective, and you’re open to working with other engineers and designers to make dreams into reality.</p><p>As a Full Stack Engineer, your responsibilities include:</p><ul><li><p>Squashing bugs: big, small, and hairy!</p></li><li><p>Building features like accounting integrations, travel budgets, and more.</p></li><li><p>Guiding and enabling others in the technical organization: we'll share our editor tricks, dotfiles and productive workflow. Share yours!</p></li><li><p>Asking questions about things you don’t understand and challenging the status quo</p></li></ul><p>For the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:</p><ul><li><p>Has experience writing real-world software to solve real-world solutions.</p></li><li><p>Communicates well, both in the code (WE &lt;3 COMMENTS!) as well as with our team and industry partners</p></li><li><p>Is a natural problem solver</p></li><li><p>Wants to develop and grow their skills in programming and leadership within the organization</p></li></ul><p>While we use a number of different technologies and languages, for this role we are looking for people who already have a strong understanding of JavaScript, PHP, C++, Java, algorithms, and design patterns. This position is the foundation for launching a career with Expensify, with the expectation you’ll carry these skills into new domains.</p><h3>Compensation &amp; Benefits</h3><ul><li><p>Annual Pension Contribution</p></li><li><p>100% Coverage for Dental/Vision Premiums</p></li><li><p>Free Lunch</p></li></ul><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:</p><ol><li><p>What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?</p></li><li><p>What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?</p></li><li><p>What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?</p></li><li><p>How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</p></li></ol><h3>Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyway! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href='mailto:jobs@expensify.com' rel='nofollow'>jobs@expensify.com</a>. We're excited to hear from you!</h3>",

Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most discussed perk is our offshore where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we went to Uruguay, do you want to join?About YouWhether you’re building features like calendar integrations, importing credit card transactions, or pulling information from receipts, you’re self-driven and collaborative. You’re an autonomous individual who is passionate about making code beautiful and effective, and you’re open to working with other engineers and designers to make dreams into reality. - As a Full Stack Engineer, your responsibilities include:- Squashing bugs: big, small, and hairy!- Building features like accounting integrations, travel budgets, and more.- Guiding and enabling others in the technical organization: we'll share our editor tricks, dotfiles and productive workflow. Share yours!- Asking questions about things you don’t understand and challenging the status quoFor the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:- Has experience writing real-world software to solve real-world solutions.- Communicates well, both in the code (WE &lt;3 COMMENTS!) as well as with our team and industry partners-Is a natural problem solver- Wants to develop and grow their skills in programming and leadership within the organizationWhile we use a number of different technologies and languages, for this role we are looking for people who already have a strong understanding of JavaScript, PHP, C++, Java, algorithms, and design patterns.

See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:1. What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?2. What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?3. What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?4. How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyway! Forward your responses to the questions to jobs@expensify.com. We're excited to hear from you!",
