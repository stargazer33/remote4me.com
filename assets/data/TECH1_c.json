Businesses trust Fastly to accelerate the pace of technical innovation, mitigate evolving threats, and scale on demand. Founded in 2011, Fastly powers online destinations including Airbnb, GitHub, Alaska Airlines, Pinterest, Vimeo, The Guardian, The New York Times and Ticketmaster.</p><p>The worldwide cloud services market is projected to grow rapidly to $236 billion in 2020, according to Forrester, Inc. As more and more businesses move operations to the cloud, Fastly is well positioned to continue increasing CDN, cloud networking and cloud security market share with edge cloud services that reach beyond content delivery.</p><p>We’re building a better Internet. Come join us.</p><p><strong>Senior Software Engineer – Isolation Team</strong></p><p>At Fastly, our technology stretches from front-end web development, down through to kernel work. We have many large C codebases where maximizing execution speed, minimizing resource consumption and maintaining security guarantees are critical to our business.</p><p>The isolation team is creating a compiler collection and runtime for software fault isolation of untrusted code. The tools this team creates are used by others at Fastly to ensure that our C codebases can grow in features and complexity without compromising on either security or performance.</p><p>Compiler-related work is often undervalued. This company values it.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p><ul><li>Communication within a team</li><li>Design and implementation of software which generates, manipulates, loads, and runs machine code and object files.</li><li>Delivering tools and documentation to engineers on other teams, and training and supporting them as they use those tools to enhance their own projects.</li></ul><p><strong>What We’re Looking For</strong></p><ul><li>A desire to write both C and Rust. Not just begrudgingly. Its OK if you don’t know Rust yet.</li><li>Experience writing and debugging assembly and machine code. You know your way around binutils and gdb.</li><li>Enough of a background in compilers to give a strong practical and theoretical footing to your work. This includes understanding of the interactions between the compiler, linker, and loader.</li><li>Code stability and maintainability are important to us.</li><li>You don’t see refactoring as a chore, but as something which is satisfying in itself.</li><li><strong>You needn’t have a formal CS education; suitable experience is just as relevant.</strong></li></ul><p>We value a variety of voices, so this is not a laundry list. You’ll be a good candidate if you have experience in SOME of these:</p><ul><li>You have written or contributed to a compiler or operating system, even a toy or research one.</li><li>You have used Rust, or some of the languages that influenced the design of Rust.</li><li>You have spent a few dozen hours of your life waiting for GCC or LLVM to build. You’ve played with features that aren’t properly documented and read the source code and mailing lists to figure out how they work.</li><li>You have used a handful of IDLs, and can have a conversation about what tradeoffs they made.</li><li>You have used fuzzers, property-based testing tools, SMT solvers, or formal methods.</li><li>You enjoy functional programming but are no longer a zealot.</li><li>You have audited C software for vulnerabilities, or worked with auditors of your own C code to correct issues.</li><li>You have participated in security capture-the-flag games, or reverse engineered software or hardware.</li></ul><p><strong>Why Fastly?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>have</strong>&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>&nbsp;<strong>huge</strong>&nbsp;<strong>impact.</strong>&nbsp;Fastly is a small company with a big reach. Not only do our customershave a tremendous user base, but we also support a growing number of open source projects and initiatives. Outside of code, employees are encouraged to share causes close to their heart with others so we can help lend a supportive hand.</li><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>love</strong>&nbsp;<strong>distributed</strong>&nbsp;<strong>teams.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Fastly’s home-base is in San Francisco, but we have multiple offices and employees sprinkled around the globe. In fact, 50% of our employees work outside of SF! An international remote culture is in our DNA.</strong></li><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>care</strong>&nbsp;<strong>about</strong>&nbsp;<strong>you.</strong>&nbsp;Fastly works hard to create a positive environment for our employees, and we think your life outside of work is important too. We support our teams with great benefits like up to 20 weeks of paid parental leave, options for free medical/dental/vision plans, and an open vacation program that enables our folks to take the time they need to recharge (some benefits may vary by location).</li><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>value</strong>&nbsp;<strong>diversity.</strong>&nbsp;Growing and maintaining our inclusive and diverse team matters to us. We are committed to being a company where our employees feel comfortable bringing their authentic selves to work and have the ability to be successful — every day.</li><li><strong>We</strong>&nbsp;<strong>are</strong>&nbsp;<strong>passionate.</strong>&nbsp;Fastly is chock full of passionate people and we’re not one size fits all’. Fastly employs authors, pilots, skiers, parents (of humans and animals), makeup geeks, coffee connoisseurs, and more. We love employees for who they are and what they are passionate about.</li></ul><p>We’re always looking for humble, sharp, and creative folks to join the Fastly team.

We're bringing world class research into the classrooms. You're working on making our speech platform scale for thousands of pupils practicing their pronunciation in realtime. Our backend consists of C++ for the heavy lifting (speech processing using Deep Neural Networks) with a user facing Python API (REST + websockets). Along with scaling up, you'll add new features and fix bugs (in reverse order, obviously ). You'll be working with our researchers on one side and the frontend developers that create and use our JS SDK interfacing with the Python backend. Your main responsibility will be backend, but since you work in a startup, it's very useful if you know some JS so you can adapt the JS SDK yourself sometimes. We don't have the luxury of a big front- and backend team, yet… </p><p>We expect&nbsp;<strong>from you</strong></p><p>Do you also get butterflies in your stomach when you think of developing awesome C++ and Python code? Are you able to switch easily between the two of them, but more importantly, do you like that? Are you interested in real-time audio, squeezing out performance gains across the whole stack? Are you a keen learner and do you like tinkering with the latest web technology?</p><p>You know your way around in software development. You know the definition of done is not “hey, works on my machine!” so you don’t hesitate to actually test your software using our frontend code as well. You are able to give but also receive code reviews and understand how that helps in being a better professional.</p><p>Does that sound like you? Ready to expand your horizons? Then you will definitely have an interesting time with us!</p><p>You’ll be joining a friendly environment in which you don’t have to be afraid to speak your mind or ask permission about how you think you should get something done.

We're looking for someone who knows algorithms, a few different languages, distributed systems, REST servers, Linux configuration, and maybe even some machine learning. If you want to be designing novel algorithms in C++ one day, writing Kotlin server code to expose your new algorithm as a REST endpoint the next, and then configuring the production deployment the day after that, then this is the opportunity for you!</p><p>Revl makes auto-editing software and smart action cameras. Our customers are sky diving operations, big auto industry players, and zip line operators. What they all have in common is that they want to use our cameras to capture their client's experiences and then use our software to automatically turn all that footage into a great final edited video that they can sell to their customers. Our auto editing software is fast: a final rendered video is ready less than two minutes after the client has completed the experience! You can see our complete system in action here: <a href='https://youtu.be/8RmMQafi9Us' rel='nofollow'>https://youtu.be/8RmMQafi9Us</a>.</p><p>We are well funded by several reputable VC's and Angel Investors including Y Combinator, Comcast Ventures, Frog Design Ventures, Luma Pictures, Bill Tai, and Lars Rasmussen.
