    "content": "*Yoto*\n<br>Yoto is a company founded by experienced entrepreneurs that aims to change the way children access audio content. We are building a safe, digital audio platform made for kids from the ground up, and featuring a curated library of music, stories, radio, podcasts and learning activities for children aged 2-8. Yoto features its own carefully connected smart speaker that children control with physical cards.\n<br>\n<br>Designed by families for families and inspired by Montessori principles, Yoto gives youngsters autonomy over what they listen to or play – from their favourite nursery rhymes to learning the alphabet through phonics, and provides an exciting alternative to excessive screen time.\n<br>\n<br>Yoto launched its first hardware product on &quot;Kickstarter&quot;:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yoto/yoto-a-clever-speaker-for-kids in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and has won a Red Dot Design award. The product shipped for Christmas 2018 to a great customer reaction. We have already partnered with the Roald Dahl company - to create new content based on his classic stories - as well as publishers including Hachette, HarperCollins, Naxos, StoryNory and more. Luke Kelly, grandson of Roald Dahl and MD of the Roald Dahl Story Company, is on our board.\n<br>\n<br>*About us*\n<br>We’re a small, creative team with a passion for technology, education, music, audiobooks and podcasts. We’ve built companies at scale before (dotmusic - sold to Yahoo, 7digital - IPO in 2014, Bouncepad, and Frukt - sold to Interpublic) and we’re bringing that experience to the world of audio entertainment and learning for children.\n<br>\n<br>As a start-up, we don’t revel in office politics and endless meetings, giving you more time to get on with the more fun part of the job. We all love what we do.\n<br>\n<br>*The position*\n<br>We’re looking for experienced FreeRTOS developer to be in charge of design and development of firmware and apps running on Yoto players.\n<br>\n<br>We strongly value a healthy work-life balance.

By not relying on pattern matching or similar approximations, CodeSonar's static analysis engine is extraordinarily deep, finding 3-5 times more defects on average than other static analysis tools.</p>\n <p>Unlike many software development tools, such as testing tools, compilers, configuration management, etc., SAST tools can be integrated into a team's development process at any time with ease. SAST technologies like CodeSonar simply attach to your existing build environments to add analysis information to your verification process.</p>\n <p>The <strong>Research Team </strong>responds to Request for Proposals from government and other sponsors:</p>\n <p>Our expertise in software analysis and binary transformation comes from decades of experience of high-tech research with the U.S. government and other organizations. Over the past two decades, we have partnered with several groups to help solve some of the most complex software challenges that impact devices' resiliency, safety, and security. Our work has been focused in three areas:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Software Assurance:</strong>&nbsp;new techniques and technologies for analyzing and correcting software to ensure runtime integrity and prevent unplanned system breaches and failures.</li>\n  <li><strong>Software Hardening:</strong>&nbsp;technologies solely focused on system resiliency.</li>\n  <li><strong>Autonomic Computing:</strong>&nbsp;providing software systems with the ability to ‘self-protect’</li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Competitive base salaries - whether in Ithaca, Madison or remote!</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flex Time - flexible hours, ample vacation time, available day one</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Floating Holidays - flexible holidays can be taken on any day</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Healthcare -health, dental, &amp; vision; covered day one</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Annual bonuses and raises - above cost of living increases</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Generous pension plan - after 13 months of employment</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>SNACKS - plenty of free snacks!</span> </li> \n</ul>",

We are responsible for low level technologies like cluster filesystems as well as web-based frontends for monitoring and managing clusters, so we need people who are willing to learn and move around between projects and languages. We work entirely with free and open source software in upstream projects, so experience contributing to such development would be valuable, and the software we develop is used in mission critical applications so a focus on testing, test automation and software quality is also important.</p>\n <p><br>Currently, we are working on making migration to the public cloud smoother for users of our technology. This includes work on configuration management, automation, testing and monitoring, and also to work in partnership with SAP, Amazon, Microsoft and many others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n <p><br><strong>Here is a brief list of technologies and tools we work with:</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Python, Go, Ruby, Salt, Terraform, &nbsp;Prometheus, Grafana, C, C++, Autotools, Git, Pacemaker, Corosync, Bash, Perl, Ansible, Travis CI, Jenkins, Docker, Swagger, Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, Node.js,md-raid, OCFS2, Netweaver and SAP HANA.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It's a long list! If you know all of them that is amazing. None of us do! But together as a team, we cover all of these things and more.

Also, if you have experience with Agile and Devops methodologies or understand this culture and values, this can make this position right for you.&nbsp;<br>Would be great if you have experience with Cloud Providers like Azure, AWS and GCP and know the challenges to deploy Enterprise solutions there, like SAP, Oracle, or any other mission critical applications. &nbsp;If you know how to do it using a cluster, this is awesome. We work with clusters, so familiarity with high-availability is a big plus.</p>\n <br>Don't worry if you don't have any of these experiences, you can still show us your potential and motivation to learn about them!\n <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n <br>\n <strong>We Offer:</strong>\n <ul>\n  <li>Direct contact with representatives of free and open source software projects worldwide.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Regular &quot;Hackweeks&quot; and workshops on the company, department, and team levels.</li>\n  <li>Opportunities to take part in IT and open-source conferences all over the world, both as an attendee or a presenter.</li>\n  <li>Five weeks vacation.

Join our vision to transform workplace communication as we know it.</p>\n <p>Fuze is a leading unified communications as a service (UCaaS) provider focused on modernizing and simplifying day-to-day business conversations. We unify collaboration technologies like voice, video, and messaging on a single cloud-based platform so users can experience greater efficiency and less hassle each workday. The company is growing rapidly as we move full steam ahead toward our anticipated IPO. Now’s the time to bring your passion and expertise to our Fuze team!</p>\n <p>Our customers use our software across a variety of platforms including Windows, OS X, iOS, Android and web. We build our software to work and provide a great experience across all of these platforms. Whenever possible we use open source technologies like WebRTC or OPAL. Where it makes sense we build our own software stacks. The Real Time Communications team also builds linux-based microservices that provide audio, video, screen share, content, recording and interoperability gateway functions. These microservices use a combination of REST APIs and IETF standards based protocols to provide functionality to our desktop, mobile and web-based clients. These microservices are built with scalability, resiliency and performance in mind.</p>\n <p>The primary task of the Real Time Communications team is to build the heart of our product — the software stacks that power the audio and video communications within our product. This team works across both the client and backend stacks.

Yoto features its own carefully connected smart speaker that children control with physical cards.\n<br>\n<br>Designed by families for families and inspired by Montessori principles, Yoto gives youngsters autonomy over what they listen to or play – from their favourite nursery rhymes to learning the alphabet through phonics, and provides an exciting alternative to excessive screentime.\n<br>\n<br>Yoto launched its first hardware product on Kickstarter in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and has won a Red Dot Design award.

We are reinventing the way people look at expense reports by automating not just the expense report, but the entire business trip. Joining our team means you are helping us fight the good fight against expense reports that suck!</p>\n<p>We are expanding into the UK market and its very early stage for our London based team. Help shape the team that will launch our global domination of expense reports and maintain a standard of excellence around the world.</p>\n<p>Joining our team means you will be working in our fast paced environment and you are fearless of our next big challenge. Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most discussed perk is our offshore where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we are heading to Vietnam, do you want to join?</p>\n<h3>About You</h3>\n<p>Whether you’re building features like calendar integrations, importing credit card transactions, or pulling information from receipts, you’re self-driven and collaborative. You’re an autonomous individual who is passionate about making code beautiful and effective, and you’re open to working with other engineers and designers to make dreams into reality.</p>\n<p>As a Full Stack Engineer, your responsibilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><p>Squashing bugs: big, small, and hairy!</p></li>\n <li><p>Building features like accounting integrations, travel budgets, and more.</p></li>\n <li><p>Guiding and enabling others in the technical organization: we'll share our editor tricks, dotfiles and productive workflow. Share yours!</p></li>\n <li><p>Asking questions about things you don’t understand and challenging the status quo</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><p>Has experience writing real-world software to solve real-world solutions.</p></li>\n <li><p>Communicates well, both in the code (WE &lt;3 COMMENTS!) as well as with our team and industry partners</p></li>\n <li><p>Is a natural problem solver</p></li>\n <li><p>Wants to develop and grow their skills in programming and leadership within the organization</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we use a number of different technologies and languages, for this role we are looking for people who already have a strong understanding of JavaScript, PHP, C++, Java, algorithms, and design patterns. This position is the foundation for launching a career with Expensify, with the expectation you’ll carry these skills into new domains.</p>\n<h3>Compensation &amp; Benefits</h3>\n<ul>\n <li><p>Annual Pension Contribution</p></li>\n <li><p>100% Coverage for Dental/Vision Premiums</p></li>\n <li><p>Free Lunch</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Next Steps</h3>\n<p>Applying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><p>What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?</p></li>\n <li><p>What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?</p></li>\n <li><p>What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?</p></li>\n <li><p>How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyway! Forward your responses to the questions to <a href='mailto:jobs@expensify.com' rel='nofollow'>jobs@expensify.com</a>. We're excited to hear from you!</h3>",

    "content": "Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept:Expensify prides itself in solving a real world problem with a team of top notch engineers. Expense reports have long been a burden on the business world and working at Expensify means helping us automate every step of the process from the moment people incur their business expenses to the moment they get reimbursed with money in the bank (and everything in between!).Joining our team means you will be working in our fast paced environment and you are fearless of our next big challenge. Even though we work hard at Expensify, we make sure our employees are happy. Our most discussed perk is our offshore where we spend a month abroad working from a remote location as a team. This year we went to Uruguay, do you want to join?About YouWhether you’re building features like calendar integrations, importing credit card transactions, or pulling information from receipts, you’re self-driven and collaborative. You’re an autonomous individual who is passionate about making code beautiful and effective, and you’re open to working with other engineers and designers to make dreams into reality. - As a Full Stack Engineer, your responsibilities include:- Squashing bugs: big, small, and hairy!- Building features like accounting integrations, travel budgets, and more.- Guiding and enabling others in the technical organization: we'll share our editor tricks, dotfiles and productive workflow. Share yours!- Asking questions about things you don’t understand and challenging the status quoFor the best possible fit, we are looking for someone who:- Has experience writing real-world software to solve real-world solutions.- Communicates well, both in the code (WE &lt;3 COMMENTS!) as well as with our team and industry partners-Is a natural problem solver- Wants to develop and grow their skills in programming and leadership within the organizationWhile we use a number of different technologies and languages, for this role we are looking for people who already have a strong understanding of JavaScript, PHP, C++, Java, algorithms, and design patterns. This position is the foundation for launching a career with Expensify, with the expectation you’ll carry these skills into new domains.Compensation &amp; Benefits- Full-time, salaried position- 401k with employer match- 100% Medical/Dental/Vision contributions- Commuter benefits- Free lunch- Flexible vacation policy- Work From Home when you need itNext StepsApplying is easy, but it takes time. See, while we know you're awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of literally hundreds of other applications we get from everyone else. So this is where we're going to ask our first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so we don't accidentally overlook you? There are probably many ways to do that, but the easiest way is to help us out by answering the following questions:1. What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?2. What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?3. What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?4. How did you hear about us? A job posting? Chalk on a sidewalk? From a friend? Let us know where you saw this opening.Resume not your thing? That’s great, we don’t really read them anyway! Forward your responses to the questions to jobs@expensify.com. We're excited to hear from you!",
