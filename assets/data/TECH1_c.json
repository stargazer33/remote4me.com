    "content": "Join our NAG (Not-so-big Advisory Group) <br /><br />We need people to advise us on our spy adventures <br /><br />About us<br /><br />Bright Little Labs is building a kids media giant for the 21st century. We make kids’ books, games, and products that promote critical thinking, computer science and equality. Our flagship kids story is about Detective Dot - a nine-year-old British-Indian coder who is on a dangerous mission from the C.I.A. (Children’s Intelligence Agency). Kids can join the CIA and carry out personalised activities on and offline.<br /><br />We started on Kickstarter, reached 30 countries, got Cabinet Office backing, and have won a few of awards. Next up: we’re launching in 22,000 schools, writing the first of 3 books with a not-yet-announced publisher, and we just partnered with Turner (who own Cartoon Network!!!) so we’re making cartoons and games too. Boom!.<br /><br />If you believe wholeheartedly in the power of stories and toilet humour to inspire the next generation, get in touch.<br /><br />Please note, we value smart people over experience and qualifications. If you’re not sure you have the “right background” but love what we do, please apply! For this role particularly, we need mums, dads, aunties, uncles, grannies, grampies, teachers, students, teddy bears and children to let us know what they make of our stories. You only need to be reliable and have an opinion.<br /><br />About you<br /><br />You’re passionate about diversifying media and wish you could see more people like you and your friends on TV. You’re not afraid to voice your opinion and you know how to give constructive criticism.  Whilst you’re good at spotting a flaw you’re even better at thinking of an alternative approach; you’re filled with plan b’s,c’s,d’s,e’s,f’s….. You’re a big kid and the thought of working on the latest kids cartoons or toys makes you so excited you might… you might… who knows what you might do? Wet yourself?<br /><br />We particularly want people who can act as cultural consultants and we actively encourage people from underrepresented backgrounds to apply! Especially if you feel like you can resonate with our main characters, we want to hear from you. <br /><br />We need help with these sorts of tasks<br /><br />At least 6 times a year we’ll be reaching out to you for feedback on our latest creations.  Feedback sessions will vary in structure. Some will be remote (paid £25 per session) others in person (£50+ per session + travel) . <br />Brainstorming actionable points for improvement - if you think something is wrong with what we’re doing, help us come up with ways to make it better! <br /><br />We offer<br /><br />An awesome role helping to define the future of Bright Little Labs.<br />Exposure - we're a high-ish profile project, we work with exciting people, and you’re on our advisory board.<br />Flexible working arrangements - we’ll be hosting remote and in person sessions. <br />Money -  £325 per year minimum for your feedback on our stories. We pay more depending on how much you’re involved, but we need a minimum commitment of 6 ‘sessions’.<br />Feel good factor. You’ll be working on a project at the heart of equality, education and technology. <br />Fun - we’re building a top-secret spy agency. If we told you any more, we’d have to kill you.<br /><br />How to apply: <br /><br />In 150 words say why you want to work for us. In another 150 words say why you think you’d be the best person for the role. Remember, we particularly care about diversity in kids media and getting a variety of views on our stuff. If you’ve got 151 or 161 words, no problem. If you’ve got 200+ words, problem. It’s that simple :) <br />"

Do you have a vivid interest in elegant algorithms? Are you fluent in C++?

You will work largely independently and will be responsible for the whole range of activities when implementing a new feature. You should be able to look at a problem from the user’s perspective and discuss abstract concepts with fellow developers. We expect each of our developers to do architecture, design, implementation, customer feedback and bug fixing, rather than splitting these activities between several people. We thus put everyone in control of their own work.<br /><br />There are no deadlines, and no scheduled meetings. A feature is ready to be released when you are convinced that you have implemented the best possible solution. Meetings take place as needed, with only the people that are actually involved being required to be present. At any time in the process, ideas, suggestions and criticism from anybody in the hierarchy is welcome and is seriously considered. Your ideas are welcome, even if they mean that we have to change a lot of code to make things better.<br /><br />We have published several scientific articles in the areas of Artificial Intelligence and Computer Graphics and we will encourage you to do the same. We sponsor visits to conferences and have close relationships with universities and research institutes in the U.S. and Germany."
