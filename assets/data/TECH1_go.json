You’re not just a coder but have a passion for building things and watching them flourish.  You tinker and enjoy creating new methodologies, and never balk at completely abandoning systems and code to undertake complete re-builds. You're not about using the latest and the greatest but the right tools.</p><p>The Adacado SAAS platform (and its road map) creates many interesting technical challenges we have yet to solve.  Adacado is built on Kubernetes, Golang, Vue, and ES6, and utilizes Node, Postgres, Kafka, Aerospike, and ElasticSearch.  We manage an ever growing army of microservices (200+ unique across 300+ deployments) with special care in making our applications performant, available, and scalable.</p><p>As a developer at Adacado you will take part in designing/reviewing/writing critical application services, as well as mentoring and teaching other developers with your expertise.  You will collaborate closely with teammates to implement and ship new functions in a fast paced environment where you catch errors and deploy same-day fixes on a regular basis.  You feel a personal pride in the code that you produce and enjoy a culture of friendly coding ‘one-upmanship’.  You aren’t afraid of spending time to try something and then throw it out all-together to start anew if it doesn’t fit the bill.  You enjoy discussing design patterns and problem solving with your colleagues.</p><p>The Adacado TeamEveryone at Adacado believes in our product, making our group close knit.  We live through our trials and tribulations together (often over great Vancouver craft beer or other libations). Our staff are our most valuable resource (see our link).</p><p>We provide our team members with competitive compensation with benefits and  stock options, liberal time off, flexible work hours and telecommuting, and a generous skills-development/education budget.   All developers also receive a standup-desk, dual monitors, and a nerf gun (yes, a nerf gun).</p><p>Adacado is located in the heart of downtown Vancouver, close to public transit.  Everyday is casual day in the office and we provide a fully stocked kitchen with snacks.  We also serve lunch hot and fresh every Friday, and have in-office craft beer and wine parties and bi-annual company retreats.</p><p>LocationThis is role will be based in our Vancouver office and applicants must be fully elligible to work in Canada.

UK/EU based only.We are looking for SeniorSoftware Developerswho want to help build the next generation payment API in the cloud.We’d like to hear from enthusiastic polyglot developers who want to work with the latest technologies, solve interesting problems and be part of a really great team. There are a wide range of problems to tackle, from configuring nginx proxies to writing custom payment routing and handling logic, and we contribute open source back to the community. We believe that the language you write the code in is just how you convey your solution to the computer and the real value is being able to think through a problem.You will be working on new development projects, focused on best practice across the board, including automation of absolutely everything (Terraform for infrastructure deployments to AWS, CI/CD with contract-based testing and auto-deployment of services within Docker containers, etc.), pair programming and TDD/BDD. Although many of us live around London, we are operating as a remote team, and typically working from home and pair programming.It’s very much a “best tool for the job” mentality at Form3 and our tech-stack is always evolving but to give you a flavour of what we’re currently working with here are some of the tools we use;- Some of the languages we currently use are: Golang, Java, Python and Ruby- Some of the tools we use: Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, Vault, Consul, Linkerd- Our platform runs in AWS where we use: SQS, SNS, EC2, ECS, RDS and othersWe don’t mind whereabouts you are based as we offer the opportunity for our team to work remotely from anywhere in the UK or EU. In fact, most of our Developers work, utilising screen-share technology and pair-programming to share knowledge across the team. That being said, we also have London and Amsterdam offices, so should you occasionally wish to work from these, you’d be most welcome.Your Experience- Polyglot: Choosing the right tool to solve the problem is critical, and we expect you to have professional experience with at least 2 different programming languages and multiple platforms and tools.- Distributed architecture: We expect you to have previous experience engineering complex distributed systems, and a view on topics such as service discovery, integration testing, inter-process communication, how to define your services and APIs, as well as experience with distributed data stores.- Public cloud: You have worked with public cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud etc.)- TDD/BDD: Code quality is key, and we expect you to have worked with Test-driven development (TDD) and Behaviour-driven development (BDD) and be familiar with the use of tools such as Cucumber.Desirable Experience- Most of our code is written in Java and Go, so experience with either would be helpful.- All our services are built and managed as docker containers, so Kubernetes, and general docker experience is preferred.- We like clean code, so experience with Event Sourcing/CQRS will be useful.- We do contract-based testing, using tools such as Pact.- We work as a devops team, so experience in automating operations (such as infrastructure as code, automated monitoring and alerting, build pipelines etc) would also be useful.- Whilst experience of the above technologies would be nice, it is by no means essential. We are looking to speak with well-rounded software professionals who have a breadth of experience across a variety of programming languages, are passionate about tech and enjoy working collaboratively within a team.Perks &amp; Benefits- 100% Remote- 30 days holiday (plus Bank Holidays)- Pair programming, with an experienced team of engineers- Competitive salary- Latest technologies- Company bonus scheme- Pension contribution- Be part of an incredible and diverse teamInterview Process- Introductory call with the Talent Team at Form3- Technical Test- Technical Interview",

Now we’re building an ambitious language distribution platform so that no engineer ever has to suffer dependency hell again, and we need your help to do it! \n  <br> \n  <br>This position is open to full-time telecommuters anywhere in North America. You can also choose to work from our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC. \n  <br> \n  <br>What You’ll Be Doing \n  <br> \n  <br>As a Senior Developer working on our platform backend, you will be helping us build a highly scalable, 100% automated build system for multiple languages across multiple platforms. We’re also creating microservice APIs for other teams to code against as we build our big new thing. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our day to day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development with Pivotal Tracker as our project management tool. We’re always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so. \n  <br> \n  <br>We’re a polyglot company building our system using Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, DCOS, CircleCI, and other modern tools. Quality is as important as speed. We’re building for the long run, so you’ll need to enjoy writing tests and documentation too. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Highfive for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and Google Drive. \n  <br> \n  <br>We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code. \n  <br> \n  <br>What’s In It For You \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The chance to work on a project that will change the work lives of developers around the world. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Competitive salary, bonus, and stock option plan. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Requirements \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience creating and maintaining complex software systems along with the ability to design non-trivial applications and components from scratch. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The ability to write clean, well-tested code with clear documentation. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Deep experience with at least one programming language, and shallow experience with several. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical. You’ll need to work closely with your developer teammates, as well as be able to have coherent conversations with people from QA, sales, marketing, and other parts of the company. \n  <br> \n  <br>* A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The ability to help others on the team become better at their jobs through mentoring, thoughtful code reviews, and generally being a team player. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Assets \n  <br> \n  <br>If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Golang code, especially large code bases. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Microservices and message queues. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Docker and Kubernetes. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Perl, Python, Tcl, or Ruby, especially an understanding of their respective language communities and their toolchains. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Working At ActiveState \n  <br> \n  <br>ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We’re all about working together to find the best solutions, and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our company is a team of 40+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we’re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly don’t lack for ambition! But even though we’re ambitious we don’t expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches.

Now we’re building an ambitious language distribution platform and set of tools so that coders can focus on coding and spend less time worrying about dependency hell, third party vulnerabilities, and inconsistent developer environments.&nbsp; We’re doing this&nbsp;<strong>for every language and platform on the planet (and beyond)</strong>. We need your help to do it! Best of all you’ll be working on a product that you’ll use yourself daily.<br><br><strong>This position is open to full-time telecommuters anywhere in North America</strong>. You can also choose to work from our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC.<br><br></p>\n <p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING</strong></p>\n <p>At ActiveState we are building a highly scalable, 100% automated build system for multiple languages across multiple platforms. We’re also creating microservice APIs for other teams to code against as we build our big new thing.</p>\n <p>Your job will entail making a wide variety of enhancements and developing features that require a mixture of front-end and back-end knowledge. Examples include taking the pain out of administering a SaaS platform, helping us integrate with 3rd party services or optimizing our site to be indexable by search engines.</p>\n <p>The work includes creating new back-end services, perfecting user interface, designing internal data structures and coding micro-services that expose the data and relations. You will help integration efforts with various internal and external services used by Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Product Management to make sure the teams can perform their duties optimally. While a primary amount of your job will be described as back-end work you must be comfortable messing around with the front-end as well.</p>\n <p>When not working on code, you’ll be meeting with your team to figure out priorities, features, technical issues, etc. You’re someone with good technical knowledge who also has an interest in the end-product you’ll be building.</p>\n <p><br>Our day to day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development with Pivotal Tracker as our project management tool. We’re always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so.<br><br></p>\n <p>We’re a polyglot company and embrace using the best language for the given task at hand. You’ll regularly find Golang, Elm, Javascript, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, DCOS, CircleCI, and other modern tools. Quality is as important as speed. We’re building for the long run, so you’ll need to be proficient in writing tests and documentation too.<br><br></p>\n <p>Our back ends and command line tools for interacting with our Platform are written in Go. Experience with Go is a big plus. The front end is written in Elm. Knowledge of Elm, while preferred, is not a prerequisite. We’ve found engineers with experience in React/Redux take to the language quite naturally.&nbsp;</p>\n <p><br>The team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Highfive for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and the Google Suite.<br><br>We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code.<br><br><br></p>\n <p><strong><strong>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU</strong></strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up.</li>\n  <li>The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people.</li>\n  <li>The chance to work on a project that will change the work lives of developers around the world, including your own!</li>\n  <li>Competitive salary, bonus, and stock option plan.</li>\n  <li>Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program.<br><br></li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience with Go and Elm</li>\n  <li>The ability to quickly pick up new languages and technologies</li>\n  <li>Experience with relational database (mysql, postgres, ..).</li>\n  <li>Adequate knowledge of JavaScript and front end development.</li>\n  <li>Experience with at least one major platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) and exposure to the others.</li>\n  <li>The ability to write clean, well-tested code with clear documentation.</li>\n  <li>Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical..</li>\n  <li>A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company.</li>\n  <li>The ability to help others on the team become better at their jobs through mentoring, thoughtful code reviews, and generally being a team player.<br><br></li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong><strong>ASSETS</strong></strong></p>\n <p>If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience working on billing solutions</li>\n  <li>Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI.</li>\n  <li>Javascript tooling such as Webpack and frameworks such as React and Redux.</li>\n  <li>Elm code, especially large Single Page Apps.</li>\n  <li>Microservices and message queues.</li>\n  <li>Good working knowledge of Docker.</li>\n  <li>Experience building both web based and desktop based software.</li>\n  <li>Docker, Mesos, DCOS, Kubernetes.</li>\n  <li>Functional programming languages.</li>\n  <li>Experience with creating parsers, compilers or code intelligence systems</li>\n  <li>Experience with Process management on Windows or Unix environments</li>\n  <li>Work with reactive, event based systems</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong><strong>Working At ActiveState</strong></strong></p>\n <p>ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture.

We are responsible for low level technologies like cluster filesystems as well as web-based frontends for monitoring and managing clusters, so we need people who are willing to learn and move around between projects and languages. We work entirely with free and open source software in upstream projects, so experience contributing to such development would be valuable, and the software we develop is used in mission critical applications so a focus on testing, test automation and software quality is also important.</p>\n <p><br>Currently, we are working on making migration to the public cloud smoother for users of our technology.

Also, if you have experience with Agile and Devops methodologies or understand this culture and values, this can make this position right for you.&nbsp;<br>Would be great if you have experience with Cloud Providers like Azure, AWS and GCP and know the challenges to deploy Enterprise solutions there, like SAP, Oracle, or any other mission critical applications. &nbsp;If you know how to do it using a cluster, this is awesome. We work with clusters, so familiarity with high-availability is a big plus.</p>\n <br>Don't worry if you don't have any of these experiences, you can still show us your potential and motivation to learn about them!\n <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n <br>\n <strong>We Offer:</strong>\n <ul>\n  <li>Direct contact with representatives of free and open source software projects worldwide.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Regular &quot;Hackweeks&quot; and workshops on the company, department, and team levels.</li>\n  <li>Opportunities to take part in IT and open-source conferences all over the world, both as an attendee or a presenter.</li>\n  <li>Five weeks vacation.

Our mission is to radically change the way people control their data with technology — we believe that the world’s most valuable future technology will be built on a new model where individuals have complete agency over the data they create. We have become known for creating an early [IPFS-based](https://ipfs.io) photo-sharing application, [Textile Photos](https://textile.photos/). More recently we have built a following around our suite of freely available tools to build apps more generally on IPFS. The suite of tools includes a decentralized database, real-time app data, communication tools, remote backup and recovery, identity tools, and encryption tools available over APIs and in cross-platform SDKs. Our technology already powers a diversity of applications from collaborative writing apps to patient-doctor chat apps.From our work, we plan to support a network of applications, connected through interoperable data, that will allow users to own and control their data in a new way. Nothing like Textile has ever existed at scale before, and we now have the potential to rewire the internet and allow for new forms of apps and services. [We are a small](https://twitter.com/textileio/lists/textile-team/members), fully remote team aligned in our vision to change the relationship between technology and personal data.
