    "content": "<h3> Marketing &amp; Growth Lead </h3><div><div>Hi, we're Knack, a no-code productivity platform that’s redefining how work gets done. Knack is used by thousands of customers — from non-profits to the world’s biggest organizations — to run processes, departments, and even entire companies.</div><div><br></div><div>Over the past 5 years we've done the hard work of building a great team, product, and culture. Now we're ready to tell our story to the world and take Knack’s impact to the next level. We need an ambitious marketer to help take us there.<br><br></div><div>You’ll be responsible for crafting our messaging and forming our overall marketing strategy, and leading the way on execution. You’ll be supported directly by the CEO and a team of advisors, with room to build a team or outsource.<br><br></div><div>This is a <strong>100% remote role</strong>, so self-motivation and independence is a must. You'll be given the autonomy to define how to do your best work, and will help define the big picture goals to work towards.<br><br></div><h3>About the role and the work</h3><div>Knack has primarily been a no-code online database product, where our customers move spreadsheets into Knack and then build business apps to make their data useful.<br><br></div><div>It turns out that customers that get the most value from Knack are the ones using it for much more than an online database—they are using Knack to <strong>automate core business processes and workflows</strong>.<br><br></div><div>The first question of the overall <strong>marketing strategy</strong> will be redefining our messaging and category to optimize around this unique value proposition. You’ll have ample research and data to pull from, including customer surveys, jobs to be done analysis, and multiple case studies and video testimonials.<br><br></div><div>Along with this strategic work, you’ll be responsible for <strong>tactical execution</strong>. You’ll start as a marketing team of one, but you’ll have the autonomy to build a team or find the right partners. Knack has a culture of craftsmanship, and we favor strong day-to-day skills that can help execute on marketing plans. You’ll be supported by the CEO and a dedicated advisory team.<br><br></div><div>This work will include the standard SaaS marketing playbook like analytics, inbound, SEO, content, and social, along with unique opportunities like growing an emerging economy of Knack partners and consultants who use Knack to help businesses automate their processes in the cloud.<br><br></div><div>This role includes driving the marketing culture at Knack. You’ll be expected to detail marketing updates and insights for the whole company, align marketing with the other teams at Knack, and set up data-driven reporting for tracking and progress.</div><h3>About You</h3><div><strong>You’ve done this work before.</strong> And you want to do it again, except even better this time, for an opportunity that can get the most out of your experience and skill set. You’ve seen enough to know what works and what doesn’t.<br><br></div><div><strong>You can go deep on strategy.</strong> You can see the big picture and integrate marketing into broader company dynamics. You can use thought experiments and hypotheticals to consider the pros and cons of different long-term proposals.<br><br></div><div><strong>You relish a challenge.</strong> This work will be incredibly challenging, and that excites you. It’s a big, evolving space with complex products and increasing competition. The potential solution space for consideration is vast. Knack is a bootstrapped company where spend matters.<br><br></div><div><strong>You seek feedback.</strong> You are prepared to defend your ideas, because you know that subjecting them to feedback is how your best work will emerge.<br><br></div><div><strong>You still like to get your hands dirty.</strong> You’re not so far removed from the day-to-day work that you can’t help make your ideas happen. You invest in your craft, always learning and understanding the marketing landscape.<br><br></div><div><strong>You are a master of execution.</strong> You have a proven system for project management and tactical execution. You’re an excellent writer and can clearly communicate your vision to the broader team. You’re comfortable defining KPIs and being accountable to them. You’re transparent with your work and always open to collaboration.<br><br></div><div><strong>You take big swings.</strong> You’re creative and capable of completely ignoring accepted wisdom when the right opportunity arises. You’re comfortable considering moonshots, but you back this up with experiments and data to validate and de-risk.<br><br></div><div><strong>You are humble but opinionated.</strong> You don’t care where the best ideas come from as long as those are the ideas we focus on. You’ll take a stand yet commit even when you disagree. You’re honest about your strengths and weaknesses.<br><br></div><div><strong>You are hungry for meaningful work, and space to do it.</strong> Knack is a complex product in a complex space and the work is extremely challenging - but also deeply rewarding.

We have the liberty to exclusively focus on providing the most value possible to our users.<br><br></div><div>Maintaining a small group is essential to us as it creates tighter bonds, increases productivity, and eases communication. We're currently a team of 6 and love it this way. We're in five different countries (,,,,) meaning working remotely is in our DNA.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>The Role<br></strong><br></div><div>We're looking for someone eager to build the most comprehensive database of companies and professionals by using the web.

Some folks may just want a weekend trip to visit family, while others want to visit Japan but aren’t yet sure when or how long to go.

The scale of data that comes from that collaboration is immense — 34M+ developers, 2M+ organizations, 100M+ repositories, 1.1B+ contributions, and 200M+ pull requests in 2018.</p><p>Helping developers navigate and understand all of that data is a core part of GitHub’s mission, and an area with potential we’ve only begun to realize. We have high aspirations for how we can help developers understand and navigate code, and for making collaboration more seamless. The foundation for these efforts is Search.</p><p>Search at GitHub, a feature used by millions, is a vital piece of the puzzle, and one which has been underserved over recent years. We are currently reinventing the way that developers can search on the platform — re-thinking everything from the experience to the system architecture supporting it.</p><p>Engineers on the search team will work on challenges of scale, flexibility, and algorithm design to create novel systems to support a new search experience. One that makes development more powerful and more accessible to the increasing population of people taking part in software development.</p><p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll get to work on challenging problems like building the distributed systems that handle search for the world’s largest source code host.</li><li>You’ll play a major role in the design and implementation of our new search platform.</li><li>Users have some very strong opinions about GitHub search — You’ll have a chance to make a bunch of developers’ lives better!</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Writing robust, maintainable code for distributed backend search systems.</li><li>Building the backend components needed to allow users to search across a variety of content types.</li><li>Working with monitoring and automation tools to ensure the availability of our Search systems.</li><li>Providing feedback and code reviews to your peers in a sensible and empathetic way.</li></ul><p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li>Proficiency in Go.</li><li>Experience building, scaling, and maintaining distributed systems.</li><li>Experience making technical decisions accounting for trade-offs.</li><li>Strong communication skills – you speak, and write, your mind well.

Over 40 million people use GitHub to build amazing things together across 100 million repositories. We make it easier for developers to be developers: to work together, to solve challenging problems, to create the world’s most important technologies. We foster a collaborative community that can come together as individuals and in teams to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.</p><p><strong>Leadership Principles:</strong></p><ul><li>Customer Obsessed</li><li>Trust by Default</li><li>Ship to Learn</li><li>Own the Outcome</li><li>Growth Mindset</li><li>Global Product, Global Team</li><li>Anything is Possible</li><li>Practice Kindness</li></ul><p><strong>Why You Should Join:</strong></p><p>At GitHub, we constantly strive to create an environment that allows our employees (Hubbers) to do the best work of their lives. We’ve designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily. The other half of our Hubbers work remotely in 18 countries across the globe.</p><p>We are also committed to keeping Hubbers healthy, motivated, focused and creative. We’ve designed our top-notch benefits program with these goals in mind. In a nutshell, we’ve built a place where we truly love working, we think you will too.</p><p>GitHub is made up of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and lifestyles. We embrace diversity and invite applications from people of all walks of life. We don’t discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, disability, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences. Also, if you have a disability, please let us know if there’s any way we can make the interview process better for you; we’re happy to accommodate!</p><p>Please note that benefits vary by country, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask your Talent Partner.</p><p>#LI-POST</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1875361' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Our goal is to make it easier for businesses to connect with each other. We make it happen by continually analyzing public data on the web and make it easy and practical to search.\\n\\nWe built Hunter to match our needs and aspirations (hopefully, you'll share them too!). This means we're bootstrapped and don't intend to raise any funds. And because we're building a real long-term business, we've made sure to be profitable from the start. We have the liberty to exclusively focus on providing the most value possible to our users.\\n\\nMaintaining a small group is essential to us as it creates tighter bonds, increases productivity and eases communication. We're currently a team of 6 and love it this way. We're all in a different country (,,,,,) meaning working remotely is in our DNA.\\n\\n\\n**Benefits**\\n\\nThis job isn't for everyone. But if you're looking to work remotely, in a small business having an impact on hundreds of thousands of professionals, and with plenty of time aside from your work, then it should be perfect!\\n\\nThe team gathers during company retreats three times per year, each time in a new location in Europe. During these one-week events, the team gets to know each other and prepare the projects for the following months.\\n\\nBeing part of the Hunter team will also get you:\\nA competitive salary with no negotiation\\n5 weeks of paid vacation per year\\n3 company retreats in Europe every year\\nFully-paid setup to get started (including a Macbook Pro, standing desk and ergonomic chair)\\n$5,000 vacation bonus per year for a far-away trip\\nAn awesome team \\n\\nIf you’re curious to learn more about the hiring process, we wrote a [blog post](https://blog.hunter.io/how-we-hire-f1f70fcc5b23) about it. And if you have some questions for us, you’ll find our contact information on our [About page](https://hunter.io/about).\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n You’ll have the lead on the Go application managing Hunter’s business database. We're looking for someone eager to build the most comprehensive database of companies and professionals by using the web. Billions of pages of unstructured HTML data don’t scare you away; they give you ideas!\\n\\nWe’re looking for an imaginative developer. We’re processing vast amounts of data to help hundreds of thousands of professionals… all of this with a tiny but mighty team! To succeed, we need to be more creative than anyone else.\\n\\nYour mission will include writing Go code to collect, process and organize our data. We’re also starting to use machine learning to bring Hunter’s data to the next level. Ideally, you’re also curious and skilled in deployments of applications to find the best setup to run the code you’ll write. \\n\\n# Requirements\\n* You’re a skilled and experienced Go developer writing high quality, maintainable and testable code (if you think you’re a perfect fit but are new to Go, you can still apply)\\n* You’re able to find simple and elegant solutions to complex problems\\n* You have a good understanding of what makes an efficient SQL request (bonus points for familiarities with PostgreSQL)\\n* You know how to deploy applications on cloud platforms (bonus points for familiarities with Docker and Kubernetes)\\n* You’re fluent in English\\n* You believe in shipping fast, but also shipping quality work to avoid technical debt\\n* You love working remotely while maintaining great relationships with your team members \\n\\n#Location\\n- EU-only   <br>  </div> </div>",
