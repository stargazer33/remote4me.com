While other travel products start by asking departure/return dates and exact airports, we instead help people at the very beginning of their trip planning process - when they typically only know a broad sense of where, when, and why they want to go. Some folks may just want a weekend trip to visit family, while others want to visit Japan but aren’t yet sure when or how long to go.

The scale of data that comes from that collaboration is immense — 34M+ developers, 2M+ organizations, 100M+ repositories, 1.1B+ contributions, and 200M+ pull requests in 2018.</p><p>Helping developers navigate and understand all of that data is a core part of GitHub’s mission, and an area with potential we’ve only begun to realize. We have high aspirations for how we can help developers understand and navigate code, and for making collaboration more seamless. The foundation for these efforts is Search.</p><p>Search at GitHub, a feature used by millions, is a vital piece of the puzzle, and one which has been underserved over recent years. We are currently reinventing the way that developers can search on the platform — re-thinking everything from the experience to the system architecture supporting it.</p><p>Engineers on the search team will work on challenges of scale, flexibility, and algorithm design to create novel systems to support a new search experience. One that makes development more powerful and more accessible to the increasing population of people taking part in software development.</p><p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll get to work on challenging problems like building the distributed systems that handle search for the world’s largest source code host.</li><li>You’ll play a major role in the design and implementation of our new search platform.</li><li>Users have some very strong opinions about GitHub search — You’ll have a chance to make a bunch of developers’ lives better!</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Writing robust, maintainable code for distributed backend search systems.</li><li>Building the backend components needed to allow users to search across a variety of content types.</li><li>Working with monitoring and automation tools to ensure the availability of our Search systems.</li><li>Providing feedback and code reviews to your peers in a sensible and empathetic way.</li></ul><p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li>Proficiency in Go.</li><li>Experience building, scaling, and maintaining distributed systems.</li><li>Experience making technical decisions accounting for trade-offs.</li><li>Strong communication skills – you speak, and write, your mind well.

Over 40 million people use GitHub to build amazing things together across 100 million repositories. We make it easier for developers to be developers: to work together, to solve challenging problems, to create the world’s most important technologies. We foster a collaborative community that can come together as individuals and in teams to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.</p><p><strong>Leadership Principles:</strong></p><ul><li>Customer Obsessed</li><li>Trust by Default</li><li>Ship to Learn</li><li>Own the Outcome</li><li>Growth Mindset</li><li>Global Product, Global Team</li><li>Anything is Possible</li><li>Practice Kindness</li></ul><p><strong>Why You Should Join:</strong></p><p>At GitHub, we constantly strive to create an environment that allows our employees (Hubbers) to do the best work of their lives. We’ve designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily. The other half of our Hubbers work remotely in 18 countries across the globe.</p><p>We are also committed to keeping Hubbers healthy, motivated, focused and creative. We’ve designed our top-notch benefits program with these goals in mind. In a nutshell, we’ve built a place where we truly love working, we think you will too.</p><p>GitHub is made up of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and lifestyles. We embrace diversity and invite applications from people of all walks of life. We don’t discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, disability, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences. Also, if you have a disability, please let us know if there’s any way we can make the interview process better for you; we’re happy to accommodate!</p><p>Please note that benefits vary by country, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask your Talent Partner.</p><p>#LI-POST</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1875361' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Our goal is to make it easier for businesses to connect with each other. We make it happen by continually analyzing public data on the web and make it easy and practical to search.\\n\\nWe built Hunter to match our needs and aspirations (hopefully, you'll share them too!). This means we're bootstrapped and don't intend to raise any funds. And because we're building a real long-term business, we've made sure to be profitable from the start. We have the liberty to exclusively focus on providing the most value possible to our users.\\n\\nMaintaining a small group is essential to us as it creates tighter bonds, increases productivity and eases communication. We're currently a team of 6 and love it this way. We're all in a different country (,,,,,) meaning working remotely is in our DNA.\\n\\n\\n**Benefits**\\n\\nThis job isn't for everyone. But if you're looking to work remotely, in a small business having an impact on hundreds of thousands of professionals, and with plenty of time aside from your work, then it should be perfect!\\n\\nThe team gathers during company retreats three times per year, each time in a new location in Europe. During these one-week events, the team gets to know each other and prepare the projects for the following months.\\n\\nBeing part of the Hunter team will also get you:\\nA competitive salary with no negotiation\\n5 weeks of paid vacation per year\\n3 company retreats in Europe every year\\nFully-paid setup to get started (including a Macbook Pro, standing desk and ergonomic chair)\\n$5,000 vacation bonus per year for a far-away trip\\nAn awesome team \\n\\nIf you’re curious to learn more about the hiring process, we wrote a [blog post](https://blog.hunter.io/how-we-hire-f1f70fcc5b23) about it. And if you have some questions for us, you’ll find our contact information on our [About page](https://hunter.io/about).\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n You’ll have the lead on the Go application managing Hunter’s business database. We're looking for someone eager to build the most comprehensive database of companies and professionals by using the web. Billions of pages of unstructured HTML data don’t scare you away; they give you ideas!\\n\\nWe’re looking for an imaginative developer. We’re processing vast amounts of data to help hundreds of thousands of professionals… all of this with a tiny but mighty team! To succeed, we need to be more creative than anyone else.\\n\\nYour mission will include writing Go code to collect, process and organize our data. We’re also starting to use machine learning to bring Hunter’s data to the next level. Ideally, you’re also curious and skilled in deployments of applications to find the best setup to run the code you’ll write. \\n\\n# Requirements\\n* You’re a skilled and experienced Go developer writing high quality, maintainable and testable code (if you think you’re a perfect fit but are new to Go, you can still apply)\\n* You’re able to find simple and elegant solutions to complex problems\\n* You have a good understanding of what makes an efficient SQL request (bonus points for familiarities with PostgreSQL)\\n* You know how to deploy applications on cloud platforms (bonus points for familiarities with Docker and Kubernetes)\\n* You’re fluent in English\\n* You believe in shipping fast, but also shipping quality work to avoid technical debt\\n* You love working remotely while maintaining great relationships with your team members \\n\\n#Location\\n- EU-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving our employees full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers.

Every single person is key to a project and by having everyone involved&nbsp;learn the required topics we make sure that no one feels out of place.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>10 days of paid leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Fully remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible work schedules</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We love new technologies and innovation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Internal growth oportunities</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
