Now we’re building an ambitious language distribution platform so that no engineer ever has to suffer dependency hell again, and we need your help to do it!   <br>   <br>This position is open to full-time telecommuters anywhere in North America. You can also choose to work from our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC.   <br>   <br>What You’ll Be Doing   <br>   <br>As a Senior Developer working on our platform backend, you will be helping us build a highly scalable, 100% automated build system for multiple languages across multiple platforms. We’re also creating microservice APIs for other teams to code against as we build our big new thing.   <br>   <br>Our day to day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development with Pivotal Tracker as our project management tool. We’re always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so.   <br>   <br>We’re a polyglot company building our system using Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, DCOS, CircleCI, and other modern tools. Quality is as important as speed. We’re building for the long run, so you’ll need to enjoy writing tests and documentation too.   <br>   <br>Our team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Highfive for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and Google Drive.   <br>   <br>We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code.   <br>   <br>What’s In It For You   <br>   <br>   <br>* Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up.   <br>   <br>* The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people.   <br>   <br>* The chance to work on a project that will change the work lives of developers around the world.   <br>   <br>* Competitive salary, bonus, and stock option plan.   <br>   <br>* Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>   <br>   <br>* Experience creating and maintaining complex software systems along with the ability to design non-trivial applications and components from scratch.   <br>   <br>* The ability to write clean, well-tested code with clear documentation.   <br>   <br>* Deep experience with at least one programming language, and shallow experience with several.   <br>   <br>* Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical. You’ll need to work closely with your developer teammates, as well as be able to have coherent conversations with people from QA, sales, marketing, and other parts of the company.   <br>   <br>* A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company.   <br>   <br>* The ability to help others on the team become better at their jobs through mentoring, thoughtful code reviews, and generally being a team player.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Assets   <br>   <br>If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI.   <br>   <br>* Golang code, especially large code bases.   <br>   <br>* Microservices and message queues.   <br>   <br>* Docker and Kubernetes.   <br>   <br>* Perl, Python, Tcl, or Ruby, especially an understanding of their respective language communities and their toolchains.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Working At ActiveState   <br>   <br>ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture. We’re all about working together to find the best solutions, and making sure that the experience of doing so is positive for everyone involved. There is a commitment from the CEO on down to making work at ActiveState a great experience for all.   <br>   <br>Our company is a team of 40+ and growing, with 2/3rds of the positions in technical roles. We maintain a set of core, overlapping hours, but we’re flexible with specific start and end times and are understanding about appointments and life events.   <br>   <br>Our vision is to have an ActiveState solution on every device on every planet, so we certainly don’t lack for ambition! But even though we’re ambitious we don’t expect work to become your life. We know you will do your best work in a positive environment free from death marches.

Now we’re building an ambitious language distribution platform and set of tools so that coders can focus on coding and spend less time worrying about dependency hell, third party vulnerabilities, and inconsistent developer environments.&nbsp; We’re doing this&nbsp;<strong>for every language and platform on the planet (and beyond)</strong>. We need your help to do it! Best of all you’ll be working on a product that you’ll use yourself daily.<br><br><strong>This position is open to full-time telecommuters anywhere in North America</strong>. You can also choose to work from our headquarters in beautiful Vancouver, BC.<br><br></p><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL BE DOING</strong></p><p>At ActiveState we are building a highly scalable, 100% automated build system for multiple languages across multiple platforms. We’re also creating microservice APIs for other teams to code against as we build our big new thing.</p><p>Your job will entail making a wide variety of enhancements and developing features that require a mixture of front-end and back-end knowledge. Examples include taking the pain out of administering a SaaS platform, helping us integrate with 3rd party services or optimizing our site to be indexable by search engines.</p><p>The work includes creating new back-end services, perfecting user interface, designing internal data structures and coding micro-services that expose the data and relations. You will help integration efforts with various internal and external services used by Finance, Sales, Marketing, and Product Management to make sure the teams can perform their duties optimally. While a primary amount of your job will be described as back-end work you must be comfortable messing around with the front-end as well.</p><p>When not working on code, you’ll be meeting with your team to figure out priorities, features, technical issues, etc. You’re someone with good technical knowledge who also has an interest in the end-product you’ll be building.</p><p><br>Our day to day work practices are centered around GitHub, pull requests, code review, CI for testing, and agile development with Pivotal Tracker as our project management tool. We’re always looking to improve our practices and we expect you to help us to do so.<br><br></p><p>We’re a polyglot company and embrace using the best language for the given task at hand. You’ll regularly find Golang, Elm, Javascript, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, DCOS, CircleCI, and other modern tools. Quality is as important as speed. We’re building for the long run, so you’ll need to be proficient in writing tests and documentation too.<br><br></p><p>Our back ends and command line tools for interacting with our Platform are written in Go. Experience with Go is a big plus. The front end is written in Elm. Knowledge of Elm, while preferred, is not a prerequisite. We’ve found engineers with experience in React/Redux take to the language quite naturally.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The team is scattered around the US and Canada, so we coordinate with each other and the rest of the company using Slack for chat, Highfive for video calls and screen sharing, Pivotal Tracker, and the Google Suite.<br><br>We like to use open source software whenever possible, and we also like to contribute back to the open source ecosystem. We embrace open sourcing both libraries and tools developed in-house as long as those are not mission-critical code.<br><br><br></p><p><strong><strong>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Working for a stable and growing company that offers the environment and personal growth potential of a start-up.</li><li>The chance to work with a smart, passionate team of people.</li><li>The chance to work on a project that will change the work lives of developers around the world, including your own!</li><li>Competitive salary, bonus, and stock option plan.</li><li>Comprehensive benefits package and health/wellness credit program.<br><br></li></ul><p><strong><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Experience with Go and Elm</li><li>The ability to quickly pick up new languages and technologies</li><li>Experience with relational database (mysql, postgres, ..).</li><li>Adequate knowledge of JavaScript and front end development.</li><li>Experience with at least one major platform (Linux, macOS, Windows) and exposure to the others.</li><li>The ability to write clean, well-tested code with clear documentation.</li><li>Excellent written and spoken skills, both technical and non-technical..</li><li>A willingness to engage in the process of defining our work through conversations with product management, other engineering teams, and the rest of the company.</li><li>The ability to help others on the team become better at their jobs through mentoring, thoughtful code reviews, and generally being a team player.<br><br></li></ul><p><strong><strong>ASSETS</strong></strong></p><p>If you have experience with any of the following please make sure to highlight it in your cover letter:</p><ul><li>Experience working on billing solutions</li><li>Agile processes, including breaking large projects up into smaller stories, estimation, working in branches (GitHub Flow), code review, and CI.</li><li>Javascript tooling such as Webpack and frameworks such as React and Redux.</li><li>Elm code, especially large Single Page Apps.</li><li>Microservices and message queues.</li><li>Good working knowledge of Docker.</li><li>Experience building both web based and desktop based software.</li><li>Docker, Mesos, DCOS, Kubernetes.</li><li>Functional programming languages.</li><li>Experience with creating parsers, compilers or code intelligence systems</li><li>Experience with Process management on Windows or Unix environments</li><li>Work with reactive, event based systems</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Working At ActiveState</strong></strong></p><p>ActiveState has a collaborative, respectful, and professional culture.

We are responsible for low level technologies like cluster filesystems as well as web-based frontends for monitoring and managing clusters, so we need people who are willing to learn and move around between projects and languages. We work entirely with free and open source software in upstream projects, so experience contributing to such development would be valuable, and the software we develop is used in mission critical applications so a focus on testing, test automation and software quality is also important.</p><p><br>Currently, we are working on making migration to the public cloud smoother for users of our technology. This includes work on configuration management, automation, testing and monitoring, and also to work in partnership with SAP, Amazon, Microsoft and many others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>Here is a brief list of technologies and tools we work with:</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Python, Go, Ruby, Salt, Terraform, &nbsp;Prometheus, Grafana, C, C++, Autotools, Git, Pacemaker, Corosync, Bash, Perl, Ansible, Travis CI, Jenkins, Docker, Swagger, Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, Node.js,md-raid, OCFS2, Netweaver and SAP HANA.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It's a long list! If you know all of them that is amazing. None of us do! But together as a team, we cover all of these things and more. So if you know one or two of these and are interested in learning more, or if you really want to dive deep into one particular piece of technology, our team might be right for you.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>What we expect from you:</strong><br><br></p><ul><li>We expect that you know how to code and love to do it as part of a team developing great solutions for our customers, that means, code reviews, unit testing and other techniques to maintain the high quality of our deliverables will be part of your daily routine.</li><li>We also expect you to be self-motivated and eager to learn and experiment new things by your own, but also in collaboration with your and other teams, and in the end to get the things done.&nbsp;</li><li>We present our work to gather feedback and learn from the many nice people we have here at SUSE, and we expect you to do the same.</li><li>We also expect that you have experience with complex solutions that demands architecture discussions and release coordination, inside and outside of our team.</li><li>As in an international team, you will need to communicate in English and we also expect that you have some experience using Linux operating systems.</li><li>Last, and most important: We expect you to have fun while providing great solutions for our customers.</li></ul><p><br><strong>What would be nice to have:</strong><br><br></p><p>We work a lot with automation, so experience of CI/CD tools, IaC (like Terraform) and configuration management (Salt, Ansible...) would help us a lot. Also, if you have experience with Agile and Devops methodologies or understand this culture and values, this can make this position right for you.&nbsp;<br>Would be great if you have experience with Cloud Providers like Azure, AWS and GCP and know the challenges to deploy Enterprise solutions there, like SAP, Oracle, or any other mission critical applications. &nbsp;If you know how to do it using a cluster, this is awesome. We work with clusters, so familiarity with high-availability is a big plus.</p><br>Don't worry if you don't have any of these experiences, you can still show us your potential and motivation to learn about them!<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><strong>We Offer:</strong><ul><li>Direct contact with representatives of free and open source software projects worldwide.&nbsp;</li><li>Regular &quot;Hackweeks&quot; and workshops on the company, department, and team levels.</li><li>Opportunities to take part in IT and open-source conferences all over the world, both as an attendee or a presenter.</li><li>Five weeks vacation.

Our mission is to radically change the way people control their data with technology — we believe that the world’s most valuable future technology will be built on a new model where individuals have complete agency over the data they create. We have become known for creating an early [IPFS-based](https://ipfs.io) photo-sharing application, [Textile Photos](https://textile.photos/). More recently we have built a following around our suite of freely available tools to build apps more generally on IPFS. The suite of tools includes a decentralized database, real-time app data, communication tools, remote backup and recovery, identity tools, and encryption tools available over APIs and in cross-platform SDKs. Our technology already powers a diversity of applications from collaborative writing apps to patient-doctor chat apps.From our work, we plan to support a network of applications, connected through interoperable data, that will allow users to own and control their data in a new way. Nothing like Textile has ever existed at scale before, and we now have the potential to rewire the internet and allow for new forms of apps and services.

This person will work closely with the CTO in managing the technical direction of Ambassador Pro.</p><p><strong>Primary Responsibilities</strong></p><p>The lead role is really about making sure the feedback loop of a software project stays healthy.

    "content": "<span><h2>Software Engineer</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>BlueLabs Software</h3></span> <div>  <div>   <br>A few months ago we started out with the vision of building a next generation sports betting platform focused on performance, reliability, modularity and automation. We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.   <br>   <br>Our Betting Team is now on the lookout for an experienced Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.   <br>   <br>The Team   <br>   <br>The Betting Team is tasked with the provisioning of all services relating to the lifecycle of bets in our sports betting platform. This stretches from bet placement to bet settlement, including advanced features such as an event- and player-based risk management, ability to build complex bets such as from outcomes with dependent probabilities, or continuous calculation of early settlement offers (cash out).   <br>   <br>Sub-second latency is welcomed but high throughput has higher priority in the Betting domain. The goal is building a sports betting platform where no bet is rejected due to lack of capacity in the system. Bet settlement is worth a special mention as the platform needs to be able to quickly evaluate hundreds of thousands of bets upon the resulting of an underlying sporting event.   <br>   <br>You will be working on developing these services primarily in Go and have a voice in the architectural decisions surrounding them.   <br>   <br>Remote Work   <br>   <br>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.   <br>   <br>Compensation   <br>   <br>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €55k-75k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;perks&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>BS degree in Computer Science or a similar technical field   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>2+ years of professional software development experience using Go   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Interest in or previous experience with Elixir will be considered an asset   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Experience building large-scale distributed systems, communicating asynchronously via message passing using RabbitMQ or Kafka   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Deep understanding of DDD, CQRS, microservices architecture, and SQL/NoSQL data stores   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Interest in unit testing and test automation, and continuous integration/deployment   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Good understanding of DevOps concepts such as containerization, cloud computing, security and networking   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team   <br>   <br>   <br>*   <br>   <br>Good communication skills in verbal and written English   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  </div> </div>",

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p><p>Our Betting Team is now on the lookout for an experienced Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>The Betting Team is tasked with the provisioning of all services relating to the lifecycle of bets in our sports betting platform. This stretches from bet placement to bet settlement, including advanced features such as an event- and player-based risk management, ability to build complex bets such as from outcomes with dependent probabilities, or continuous calculation of early settlement offers (cash out).</p><p>Sub-second latency is welcomed but high throughput has higher priority in the Betting domain. The goal is building a sports betting platform where no bet is rejected due to lack of capacity in the system. Bet settlement is worth a special mention as the platform needs to be able to quickly evaluate hundreds of thousands of bets upon the resulting of an underlying sporting event.</p><p>You will be working on developing these services primarily in Go and have a voice in the architectural decisions surrounding them.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €55k-75k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li><p>BS degree in Computer Science or a similar technical field</p></li><li><p>2+ years of professional software development experience using Go</p></li><li><p>Interest in or previous experience with Elixir will be considered an asset</p></li><li><p>Experience building large-scale distributed systems, communicating asynchronously via message passing using RabbitMQ or Kafka</p></li><li><p>Deep understanding of DDD, CQRS, microservices architecture, and SQL/NoSQL data stores</p></li><li><p>Interest in unit testing and test automation, and continuous integration/deployment</p></li><li><p>Good understanding of DevOps concepts such as containerization, cloud computing, security and networking</p></li><li><p>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</p></li><li><p>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</p></li><li><p>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</p></li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/software-engineer-go-st-julians/c/new?source=Stack%20Overflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
