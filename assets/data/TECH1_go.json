It took over 30 years for the first 1 million solar installations to be completed. It only took another 3 years to install the second million. Over the next 2 years another 1 million homes will “go solar” and there are 90 million American households to go after that! Solar technology is cheaper, better and more reliable than ever. Unless your head is buried in a coal mine, it’s becoming abundantly clear that solar is the future.<br><br></div><div>With rapid growth &amp; mainstream adoption comes massive investment and opportunity in the space. Installation companies are growing quickly, making them hungry for even more growth. The technology is dialed, the installation process is clean, but it’s still a challenge to find customers.

Would you like to make sure no one is treated unfairly due to their cultural, racial or social status? Would you like to help us create the next generation of educational programs and admissions screening tools?</p><p><strong>Here’s a little bit about us:</strong></p><p>You’ve probably never worked with anyone like us before. We’re a dynamic&nbsp;<u>team</u>&nbsp;of practicing professionals, researchers, and scholars, with a passion to help students reach their academic and career goals. We go above and beyond to deliver the best possible services we can to our students. We make sure we are highly knowledgable about the ever-changing landscape of admissions by studying and researching admissions trends. We take our own medicine and we are constantly training to keep our individual performance and the performance of our company exceptional.</p><p>While some of us have other jobs (most of us are dedicated full-time), we take our role very seriously and contribute to our company on a regular basis because we understand the long-term impact of our work. We know how to manage our time and competing demands. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our services and impact and we are not afraid to share our ideas and collaborate with our team members. We put our company and our missions first before our own personal needs and desires. This is not a “job” to us. This is a calling. Our passion for mentoring our students and making admissions fair and scientifically sound is what gets us up in the morning. Importantly, we understand that our company is only as great as its individual members. That’s how we have become a leading academic consulting firm and that’s why we are extremely selective about our team and only pick the very best to join us and we do everything we can to support them.</p><p>We’ll be honest; working at BeMo isn’t for everyone. If you are resistant to learn more about admissions and coaching students because you believe you already know everything, if you are seeking a side job just to make a few bucks or to add another entry to your CV, if you normally don’t pay much attention to detail, or if you are looking for a short-term gig with little impact and growth, then we’re probably not right for you.</p><p>If you truly understand admissions, have outstanding written and verbal communications skills, willing to learn more and implement new strategies to coach our students, create new programs, love to be a part of the team to change the future of admissions, and looking for a long-term mission with significant impact on society, then you need to apply. Now.</p><p><strong>What we offer:</strong></p><ul><li>Be a part of our fast growing, innovative and leading academic consulting firm.</li><li>Be part of a revolution. We are creating the next generation of admissions screening tools that are light years ahead at selecting best-suited candidates compared to traditional tools, while being fair to applicants.</li><li>Be part of a&nbsp;<u>team</u>&nbsp;of A-players. We only hire the brightest individuals with the highest caliber, character and courage.</li><li><strong>Freedom to choose your hours.&nbsp;</strong>We don’t believe in 9-5. We believe in accomplishments of the highest standard.</li><li><strong>Freedom to work from anywhere around the world.&nbsp;</strong>You never have to go to the “office”. All of our services are provided online.</li><li>24/7 support. We don’t sleep. If you need our help, we’ll be there for you because this means more than just a “job” to us.</li><li>Opportunity of stocks/shares in our fast growing company for exceptional team members that embody our&nbsp;<u>core values</u>.</li><li>Opportunity for growth, independent project development and career advancement including managerial and executive roles.</li><li>Make a huge difference in the lives of aspiring future professionals and contribute to our&nbsp;<u>outstanding success rate</u>.</li></ul><p><strong>Overview:</strong></p><p><em>BeMo has an immediate need for a top caliber PhD (in psychology, education, life/health sciences or related) as a scientist and academic consultant.

While other travel products start by asking departure/return dates and exact airports, we instead help people at the very beginning of their trip planning process - when they typically only know a broad sense of where, when, and why they want to go. Some folks may just want a weekend trip to visit family, while others want to visit Japan but aren’t yet sure when or how long to go. Moonfish works by constantly ingesting and understanding flight prices and fluctuations (through a set of data partnerships with various travel companies), and then matching our users to the best flights we find on a daily basis (typically saving them 40-90% off typical prices).</p><p>We’re backed by top-tier investors including general partners from Accel, Wndrco, founder of ITA/Google flight, founder of Opendoor, and execs from Airbnb, Facebook, and Twitter.</p><p>Open Roles:</p><p>- Software Engineer: <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iZuC2sJv3jhjEbMq43QJW0PsJS_eoi0CHoRra5ctuY8/edit' rel='nofollow'>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iZuC2sJv3jhjEbMq43QJW0Ps...</a></p><p>- Product Designer:<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNTfuA2plQGZ4U0ZOQqds5ptOMFPNYvo2eqK5DVuP1g/edit' rel='nofollow'>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FNTfuA2plQGZ4U0ZOQqds5pt...</a></p>",

The scale of data that comes from that collaboration is immense — 34M+ developers, 2M+ organizations, 100M+ repositories, 1.1B+ contributions, and 200M+ pull requests in 2018.</p><p>Helping developers navigate and understand all of that data is a core part of GitHub’s mission, and an area with potential we’ve only begun to realize. We have high aspirations for how we can help developers understand and navigate code, and for making collaboration more seamless. The foundation for these efforts is Search.</p><p>Search at GitHub, a feature used by millions, is a vital piece of the puzzle, and one which has been underserved over recent years. We are currently reinventing the way that developers can search on the platform — re-thinking everything from the experience to the system architecture supporting it.</p><p>Engineers on the search team will work on challenges of scale, flexibility, and algorithm design to create novel systems to support a new search experience. One that makes development more powerful and more accessible to the increasing population of people taking part in software development.</p><p><strong>Opportunities</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll get to work on challenging problems like building the distributed systems that handle search for the world’s largest source code host.</li><li>You’ll play a major role in the design and implementation of our new search platform.</li><li>Users have some very strong opinions about GitHub search — You’ll have a chance to make a bunch of developers’ lives better!</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Writing robust, maintainable code for distributed backend search systems.</li><li>Building the backend components needed to allow users to search across a variety of content types.</li><li>Working with monitoring and automation tools to ensure the availability of our Search systems.</li><li>Providing feedback and code reviews to your peers in a sensible and empathetic way.</li></ul><p><strong>Minimum Qualifications</strong></p><ul><li>Proficiency in Go.</li><li>Experience building, scaling, and maintaining distributed systems.</li><li>Experience making technical decisions accounting for trade-offs.</li><li>Strong communication skills – you speak, and write, your mind well.

Over 40 million people use GitHub to build amazing things together across 100 million repositories. We make it easier for developers to be developers: to work together, to solve challenging problems, to create the world’s most important technologies. We foster a collaborative community that can come together as individuals and in teams to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.</p><p><strong>Leadership Principles:</strong></p><ul><li>Customer Obsessed</li><li>Trust by Default</li><li>Ship to Learn</li><li>Own the Outcome</li><li>Growth Mindset</li><li>Global Product, Global Team</li><li>Anything is Possible</li><li>Practice Kindness</li></ul><p><strong>Why You Should Join:</strong></p><p>At GitHub, we constantly strive to create an environment that allows our employees (Hubbers) to do the best work of their lives. We’ve designed one of the coolest workspaces in San Francisco (HQ), where over half of our Hubbers work, snack, and create daily. The other half of our Hubbers work remotely in 18 countries across the globe.</p><p>We are also committed to keeping Hubbers healthy, motivated, focused and creative. We’ve designed our top-notch benefits program with these goals in mind. In a nutshell, we’ve built a place where we truly love working, we think you will too.</p><p>GitHub is made up of people from a wide variety of backgrounds and lifestyles. We embrace diversity and invite applications from people of all walks of life. We don’t discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, race, religion, age, national origin, citizenship, disability, pregnancy status, veteran status, or any other differences. Also, if you have a disability, please let us know if there’s any way we can make the interview process better for you; we’re happy to accommodate!</p><p>Please note that benefits vary by country, if you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to ask your Talent Partner.</p><p>#LI-POST</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/github/jobs/1875361' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Our goal is to make it easier for businesses to connect with each other. We make it happen by continually analyzing public data on the web and make it easy and practical to search.\\n\\nWe built Hunter to match our needs and aspirations (hopefully, you'll share them too!). This means we're bootstrapped and don't intend to raise any funds. And because we're building a real long-term business, we've made sure to be profitable from the start. We have the liberty to exclusively focus on providing the most value possible to our users.\\n\\nMaintaining a small group is essential to us as it creates tighter bonds, increases productivity and eases communication. We're currently a team of 6 and love it this way. We're all in a different country (,,,,,) meaning working remotely is in our DNA.\\n\\n\\n**Benefits**\\n\\nThis job isn't for everyone. But if you're looking to work remotely, in a small business having an impact on hundreds of thousands of professionals, and with plenty of time aside from your work, then it should be perfect!\\n\\nThe team gathers during company retreats three times per year, each time in a new location in Europe. During these one-week events, the team gets to know each other and prepare the projects for the following months.\\n\\nBeing part of the Hunter team will also get you:\\nA competitive salary with no negotiation\\n5 weeks of paid vacation per year\\n3 company retreats in Europe every year\\nFully-paid setup to get started (including a Macbook Pro, standing desk and ergonomic chair)\\n$5,000 vacation bonus per year for a far-away trip\\nAn awesome team \\n\\nIf you’re curious to learn more about the hiring process, we wrote a [blog post](https://blog.hunter.io/how-we-hire-f1f70fcc5b23) about it. And if you have some questions for us, you’ll find our contact information on our [About page](https://hunter.io/about).\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n You’ll have the lead on the Go application managing Hunter’s business database. We're looking for someone eager to build the most comprehensive database of companies and professionals by using the web. Billions of pages of unstructured HTML data don’t scare you away; they give you ideas!\\n\\nWe’re looking for an imaginative developer. We’re processing vast amounts of data to help hundreds of thousands of professionals… all of this with a tiny but mighty team! To succeed, we need to be more creative than anyone else.\\n\\nYour mission will include writing Go code to collect, process and organize our data. We’re also starting to use machine learning to bring Hunter’s data to the next level. Ideally, you’re also curious and skilled in deployments of applications to find the best setup to run the code you’ll write. \\n\\n# Requirements\\n* You’re a skilled and experienced Go developer writing high quality, maintainable and testable code (if you think you’re a perfect fit but are new to Go, you can still apply)\\n* You’re able to find simple and elegant solutions to complex problems\\n* You have a good understanding of what makes an efficient SQL request (bonus points for familiarities with PostgreSQL)\\n* You know how to deploy applications on cloud platforms (bonus points for familiarities with Docker and Kubernetes)\\n* You’re fluent in English\\n* You believe in shipping fast, but also shipping quality work to avoid technical debt\\n* You love working remotely while maintaining great relationships with your team members \\n\\n#Location\\n- EU-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving our employees full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers.

Every single person is key to a project and by having everyone involved&nbsp;learn the required topics we make sure that no one feels out of place.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>10 days of paid leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Fully remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible work schedules</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We love new technologies and innovation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Internal growth oportunities</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

    "content": "<div>OpenCounter is a technology company that builds permitting and licensing software for state and local governments. We believe that 21st-century governments should provide user-friendly and accessible interfaces to core government services in order to foster economic development and safer, more connected communities. Our software furthers this goal by guiding applicants through the complex regulatory requirements associated with home improvements, new businesses, special events, and more.<br>Our software calculates where a project is allowed, which permits will be required, how much the permits will cost, and which licensed professionals need to be on the project team. When the applicant is ready to move forward, they can apply and pay for permits online. Staff then review the applications and issue official permits online. This cuts down on trips to City Hall for applicants, as well as repetitive questions for city staff.<br>OpenCounter was acquired in February 2019 by GTY Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:GTYH), which is building the pre-eminent SaaS platform for state and local governments. We're already working with 50 of the largest cities in the country and plan to scale to 500 cities in the next several years. We're looking for an energetic, friendly, and self-motivated Q.A. Lead to maintain our high quality standards as we grow.<br>Primary ResponsibilitiesTriage incoming bug reports and manage the organization of existing bugs.Assess severity of new and existing bugs and maintain a prioritized queue accordingly.Track where automated testing coverage is less than adequate and prioritize a list of feature domains in need of additional automated test coverage.Manage the manual testing of areas with low automated test coverage.Administer the weekly deploy process, including Q.A. of new functionality, running manual &quot;smoke tests&quot;, and providing a &quot;go / no go&quot; determination.Represent the needs of Q.A. throughout the software development life cycle, from ideation to design to engineering to delivery.<br>Qualifications3-5+ years of experience with agile software development quality assurance (Our platform is web-based; the strongest candidates will have experience specifically with quality assurance of web platforms.)Strong organizational skills (We move fast, which means the ability to process information quickly and stay organized is critical. Inventorying and cataloging bugs is a fundamental step in getting them fixed.)Demonstrated prioritization skills (We believe that there will always be more to do than we have the resources to accomplish (nothing is ever perfect), which focuses our attention on prioritization. Not all bugs are created equal.)Clear communication skills (This role will be cross-functionally integrated with Engineering, Product, Design, and Account Management in order to have Q.A.'s concerns represented throughout the software development life cycle. Clear and effective communication is key.)Ownership / Responsibility (We will support you when things go wrong, but we're looking for a candidate who proactively does what's required to get projects across the finish line on time.)<br>About OpenCounterOpenCounter is a distributed (&quot;remote&quot;) team headquartered in downtown San Francisco. The company was incubated at Code for America in 2012 and was a winner of the Knight News Challenge for Open Government in 2013. Since then, we've scaled to some of the largest cities in the country (San Diego, Atlanta, Detroit, Orlando, and others), and we process hundreds of thousands of permit applications each year. Our goal is to build modern tools that help cities streamline service delivery, improve citizen engagement, and promote economic development. We offer generous benefits, as well as employee stock compensation. We're looking for extraordinary people to join our small, tight-knit team.<br>Equal Opportunity EmployerOpen Counter Enterprises Inc. is an equal opportunity employer and values diversity on its team. As such, we will not discriminate against any employee or applicant on the basis of age, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, veteran status, or any other classification protected by federal, state, or local law.<br>How to ApplyPlease reply to this posting and include a brief description of why you would be a good fit.</div>",
