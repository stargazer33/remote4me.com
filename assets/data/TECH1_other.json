They range from parsing SQL, to doing extensive query rewriting and optimization, to ensuring that all results produced are safe and fully anonymous irrespective of the level of deviousness on the part of the analyst using the system.</span></p><p><span>The skills we are looking for in a candidate are:</span></p><ul><li>Intelligence and ability to deal with hard trade-offs</li><li>Great communication skills</li><li>The ability to work independently and take ownership of tasks</li><li>A desire to learn and improve</li></ul><p><span>The majority of our system is written in Elixir, but we have parts written in Rust and JavaScript as well. You’ll even find some opportunities to write F# if you want that. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus and experience with web development is not going to hurt either.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We do not specifically look for someone with experience in our particular stack. It is our experience that people who are smart tend to pick up the required tools very quickly. Likewise it is less interesting to us what your background is. At the end of the day it’s your skills, brains, and experience that matter.</span></p><p><span>Our team is exceptional and quite geographically diverse. The company was built as a remote-first company from the beginning, and we really enjoy the benefits this gives us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>We look forward to getting to know you and welcoming you to our team!</span></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/300986?reset=False&amp;ra=1CWmCGMwmesM&amp;oqs=a%3D1CWmCGMwmesM%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About sebastian@aircloak.com</h4>            <div><p>Our anonymization engine is data and use case agnostic&nbsp;and used today across banks, telcos and in healthcare.

If you bring strong technical skills and a passion for performance, this could be the role for you.</p><p>As a senior graphics developer you'll be a key part of bringing the vision for Luna 2.0 into reality, with your work being integral to the realisation of the next iteration of Luna. You'll be able to collaborate with world-class team of skilled engineers, community managers, and business developers (from Bloomberg, PayPal, and GitHub to name a few), and make your indelible mark on the future of Luna.</p><p><strong>What You'll Do</strong></p><p>As a senior graphics developer, you'll be responsible for designing and building a high-performance renderer based on web technologies for use in the Luna IDE: Luna Studio. This will involve:</p><ul><li>Working closely with stakeholders and customers to design the new GUI for Luna Studio.</li><li>Developing a design for the new renderer that will be used to implement this GUI.</li><li>Implementing the new renderer in a high-performance manner on top of WebGL and Rust (via Web Assembly).</li><li>Building a next-generation UI framework using this renderer for use in Luna Studio.</li><li>Using this UI framework to build the new GUI for Luna Studio itself.</li><li>Debug performance issues to ensure that the renderer is capable of achieving high performance even on low-powered hardware.</li><li>Creating visualisations for data science libraries using the renderer and D3.js.</li></ul><p><strong>The Skills We're Looking For</strong></p><p>We have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:</p><ul><li>A strong focus on both user experience and aesthetics.</li><li>3+ years experience with WebGL (or OpenGL).</li><li>A deep understanding of graphics abstractions including: VAOs, FBOs, PBOs, buffer types, and asynchronous computation modes.</li><li>A deep understanding of GPU techniques including: efficient buffer management, efficient GLSL construction, high-performance vector and font rendering, post-processing, 3D scene description (with nested objects), lights, cameras, and animation.</li><li>2+ years experience with Rust, including experience writing <code>unsafe</code> code for FFI and performance, and using the macro system for metaprogramming. You should be able to write <em>idiomatic</em> rust code.</li><li>Practical experience building high-performance graphical interfaces for end-user-facing applications.</li></ul><p>As part of the hiring process for this job posting we're <em>very</em> interested in your previous work in these areas.
