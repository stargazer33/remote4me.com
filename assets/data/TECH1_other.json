We use them to produce car valuations, provide vehicle history checks and help dealers and insurance companies to thrive. It's an exciting time to join the business, we're growing fast on the back of epic success and we're well funded by some of London's leading VCs. It seems like every day that another massive company is signing up to use our B2B offerings (and they're house hold names, too). We are the “cool guys” shaking up an archaic industry with big data and machine learning. We have an old B2C site (cazana.com) but our ‘real’ business takes place behind closed doors (B2B) on trade.cazana.com and is only open to paying business customers.</p><p>F# experience is not necessarily required, but you should have a senior level of ability in another functional language.</p><p>Main Responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Development of Data Platform (performant processing, enrichment, cleaning, etc)</li><li>Work on internal services like F# APIs, or lambda functions (sometimes in Python)</li><li>&quot;Parenting&quot; the internal projects: improving system observability, monitoring, automatizing repeatable tasks and optimizing existing solution.</li><li>Be a senior figure to less experienced team mates, answer questions and make good suggestions.</li><li>Refactoring, fixing bugs and performing code reviews.</li><li>Be able to own a task end-to-end on your own, from figuring out what is really needed all the way up to deployment – while engaging teammates for advice and to bounce ideas off along the way.</li><li>Support the data scientists by making sure the data is in the shape they need it to be to deliver.</li></ul><p>We are a Big Data company first and foremost and an interest or experience in dealing with huge data sets is welcome.</p><p>Ideal candidate should:</p><ul><li>Be responsible and work proactively.</li><li>Be persistent and care about high quality of his/her work: this includes various testing approaches (i.e. unit, integration or property-based tests), peer reviews and performance optimizations (mostly on .NET Core platform).</li><li>Be able to share his/her knowledge and experience with other team members.</li><li>Have experience with web crawling, and the nature of scraped data.</li><li>Have a good knowledge of functional programming (a lot of our current work is done in F#).</li><li>Understand event-driven architectures, streaming and actor model programming (part of the system is written in Akka.NET streams).</li><li>Be familiar with AWS platform.</li><li>Know how to automatize deployment process (defining build tasks, Infrastructure as a Code).</li><li>Know how to build efficient, multi-threaded and distributed systems.</li><li>Have general knowledge of SQL and NoSQL. Know when to use which one, based on the business needs. Experience with PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch is always welcome.</li></ul><p>What can we offer:</p><ul><li>100% remote work: the development team embraces fully remote working practices, as we are distributed across the world. Not to say it is mandatory to be remote – we have offices in London and Bucharest. If you live in either the UK or Romania, you could consider to come to one of the offices a few days a week as suits you, or full time if it that’s what makes you happy.</li><li>Flat organization structure: this is not a PLC, we do not have architecture boards etc. We organize and prioritize our tasks by ourselves, according to business needs while balancing technical priorities. We choose technologies and solutions as a group. We trust our staff to do the job well without micromanaging them.</li><li>OSS friendliness: we use a lot of open source stuff here, and we contribute developer time to improve or fix OSS projects which help us with our goals.</li><li>Chance to work in polyglot environment: we have people working in F#, R, JavaScript, PHP and Python.</li><li>If you're a remote worker, we'll fly you into London as often as you like to spend time with us (we have beer, cake, and a very small car called Bamby in our office).</li><li>Minimal meetings. Aside from a brief ~15 minute breakfast meeting on a Monday to quickly fly over what’s on the agenda across the whole business for the week, there is a distinct lack of ‘formal’ meetings in place. We communicate mostly over slack, have adhoc video calls as needed, and work pretty flexible hours.</li></ul>        </div>        <h4>To Apply</h4>        <p>Send email with your CV to <span><span>apply-9190</span> [at] <span>functionaljobs [dot] com</span></span></p>    </div>",

This job ad might not be for you. May you find a job you are happy in either way!</p><p>You like to work independently, you are pragmatic, and you have the confidence to take on hard problems lacking a detailed spec. You value simple solutions over over-engineered ones. Chances are things will change down the line and changing something simple, or better yet something that was never made, is much easier than changing a monstrosity. You should not need or want anyone breathing down your neck to be productive.</p><p>With the formalities out of the way, let me introduce myself: my name is Sebastian, and I am the CTO at Aircloak. Aircloak is a remote company that has built a privacy preserving data processing and analytics engine. Think of it as an SQL database proxy that generates actually anonymized results on the fly.</p><p>There are countless challenging things to do in this job. They range from parsing SQL, to doing extensive query rewriting and optimization, to ensuring that all results produced are safe and fully anonymous irrespective of the level of deviousness on the part of the analyst using the system.</p><p>The skills we are looking for in a candidate are:</p><p></p><pre><code>  - Intelligence and ability to deal with hard trade-offs  - Great communication skills  - The ability to work independently and take ownership of tasks  - A desire to learn and improve</code></pre>The majority of our system is written in Elixir, but we have parts written in Rust and JavaScript as well. You’ll even find some opportunities to write F# if you want that. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus and experience with web development is not going to hurt either.<p>We do not specifically look for someone with experience in our particular stack. It is our experience that people who are smart tend to pick up the required tools very quickly. Likewise it is less interesting to us what your background is. At the end of the day it’s your skills, brains, and experience that matter.</p><p>Our team is exceptional and quite geographically diverse. The company was built as a remote-first company from the beginning, and we really enjoy the benefits this gives us.</p><p>We look forward to getting to know you and welcoming you to our team!</p><p>If you are interested, please write us at jobs [at] aircloak.com</p>",

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p><p>Our Client Services Team is now on the lookout for a Senior Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>The Client Domain is all about innovation. Here we shape our products to satisfy the needs of our heterogeneous customer base. To achieve this you will collaborate closely with the Frontend Engineers of the Client Team to design and implement bespoke APIs and services that will be used by our different products and brands.&nbsp;</p><p>The Client Services Team is tasked with the development of all backend services required by our client applications, i.e. primarily the &nbsp;API Gateway of our platform but also client-related services such as authentication, internationalisation or content management and other backend services that allow us to provide a unique experience to a specific segment of our users. Being our platform’s gateway to the outside world, scalability and responsiveness is of utmost importance in the Client Domain. It is worth noting that the traffic pattern of our platform will not only be dictated by the sporting calendar but also by the sometimes unpredictable behaviour of our users.&nbsp;</p><p>By joining our team you will be working primarily in Elixir but you will also influence the full lifecycle of our software, starting with architectural and design decisions, all the way to the implementation, testing and monitoring of the resulting services.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3).

This job ad might not be for you. May you find a job you are happy in either way!</p><p>You like to work independently, you are pragmatic, and you have the confidence to take on hard problems lacking a detailed spec. You value simple solutions over over-engineered ones. Chances are things will change down the line and changing something simple, or better yet something that was never made, is much easier than changing a monstrosity. You should not need or want anyone breathing down your neck to be productive.</p><p>With the formalities out of the way, let me introduce myself: my name is Sebastian, and I am the CTO at Aircloak. Aircloak is a remote company that has built a privacy preserving data processing and analytics engine. Think of it as an SQL database proxy that generates actually anonymized results on the fly.</p><p>There are countless challenging things to do in this job. They range from parsing SQL, to doing extensive query rewriting and optimization, to ensuring that all results produced are safe and fully anonymous irrespective of the level of deviousness on the part of the analyst using the system.</p><p>The skills we are looking for in a candidate are:</p><ul><li>Intelligence and ability to deal with hard trade-offs</li><li>Great communication skills</li><li>The ability to work independently and take ownership of tasks</li><li>A desire to learn and improve</li></ul><p>The majority of our system is written in Elixir, but there is a frontend in HTML+JavaScript, and a tiny part written in Rust as well. You’ll might even find some opportunities to write in F# from time to time. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus and experience with web development is not going to hurt either.&nbsp;</p><p>We do not specifically look for someone with experience in our particular stack. It is our experience that people who are smart tend to pick up the required tools very quickly. Likewise it is less interesting to us what your background is. At the end of the day it’s your skills, brains, and experience that matter.</p><p>Our team is exceptional and quite geographically diverse. The company was built as a remote-first company from the beginning, and we really enjoy the benefits this gives us.&nbsp;</p><p>We look forward to getting to know you and welcoming you to our team!</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/300986?reset=False&amp;ra=1CWmCGMwmesM&amp;oqs=a%3D1CWmCGMwmesM%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About Aircloak GmbH</h4>            <div><p>Our anonymization engine is data and use case agnostic&nbsp;and used today across banks, telcos and in healthcare. Our most notable customer is one of the world’s largest telcos.</p><p>The challenges in building a system like ours are countless. At the core of it lies our ability to provide a rich query interface, while ensuring that no query can ever leak sensitive information about individuals. Our technology stems out of years of research at the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems; We have academic backgrounds from the University of Cambridge, Bell Labs and Cornell University. But it takes a killer team to make a strong technology like ours a commercial success – and that’s where you come into play.</p><p>We offer competitive salaries, equity, sensible working hours and an exciting and friendly work environment.</p><p>We believe you get more and better work done&nbsp;when you have a healthy work life balance, and actively encourage that.</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>Please note: we are receiving a very high number of applications. If you want to apply, please:</p><ul><li>write a couple of lines about why it is you are applying for a job at Aircloak</li><li>Include the line &quot;I read until the bottom&quot;, so we know you actually read the job ad.</li></ul><p>Sorry for this pedantic bullshit, but it will make it significantly easier for us to filter for those who actually are looking for a job at Aircloak, and not just blanket bombing this site!</p>            </div>        ",
