Our platform is custom built in Elixir (on the server side) and JavaScript (on the client side).

We use Slack, Zoom, Pivotal Tracker, Product Plan, GitHub, Guru, Keybase, and Google Docs to collaborate and keep in touch.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll practice Test-Driven Design (TDD) on a daily basis paired with one of the other developers. This will allow you to give and receive continual feedback. You will work on vertical slices of functionality across the stack. While pair programming, you’ll refactor existing code as a matter of course.</div><div><br></div><div>You will need to weigh the short- and long-term costs and benefits of different architectural and implementation decisions.

Let me introduceyou to our company and engineering team.</p><p>Tripshot was formed in 2014 with a mission to &quot;optimize thecommute&quot;. After observing the challenges large employers face gettingtheir employees to and from work in crowded metro areas, we askedourselves how we can help.  With our backgrounds covering softwareproduct development, large-scale SAAS deployments, and selling andsupporting large enterprises, we set upon our present course todeliver the best solution to this problem.</p><p>Coming off recent sales wins, we're excited to announce that we'reexpanding the engineering team.</p><p>But before diving into what we're looking for, its fair to explainwhat our team is all about. Tripshot engineering culture emphasizes:</p><ol><li><p>Meritocracy. Good ideas come from everywhere, and we encouragehealthy discussion and debate on the team.</p></li><li><p>Focus on the important stuff. No bikeshedding. Differentiate thebusiness by tackling the difficult problems. Transportation is ripewith meaty problems in need of well engineered solutions.</p></li><li><p>Ownership. Find people with the skills, experience, and maturity toown a problem but know when they need to ask for help - then let themloose. Tripshot is a fully distributed company, and since everyoneworks from home we rely on people who can own problems, and deliversolutions.</p></li><li><p>Not all tech is created equal. We love static typing, and our techstack reflects that fact. Backend services are all written inHaskell. Writing Haskell is sheer joy and highly productive.  All webapplications are developed in GWT, in our opinion the most mature ofthe &quot;static language to javascript&quot; compilers.</p></li></ol><p>The next addition to the Tripshot engineering team will help with boththe backend and web apps. Most of our new features require changes toboth in roughly 75/25 proportion, but varies depending on the task.</p><p>Requirements:</p><ul><li><p>Haskell experience is an absolute requirement. Personal projects arefine if they can be shared with us.</p></li><li><p>Java experience preferred. Its not necessary to have worked with GWTbefore, but that would be a bonus.</p></li><li><p>Highly motivated individual with excellent personal time managementskills. You will be working from home.</p></li><li><p>Excellent analytical skills. Our roadmap is full of interestingproblems requiring non-trivial algorithm design.</p></li><li><p>Must be eligible to work in the US.</p></li></ul><p>Tripshot is committed to equal employment opportunity without regardfor race, color, national origin, ethnicity, gender, protected veteranstatus, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion.</p>        </div>        <h4>To Apply</h4>        <p>Send resume to <span><span>apply-9101</span> [at] <span>functionaljobs [dot] com</span></span></p>    </div>"

Most teachers (88%) are women who operate as independent freelancers in multiple venues. But they’re not 'tech-savvy’, and they’re underserved by existing products. YogaTrail is a free platform that provides yoga pros the tools they need to communicate with yogis, take bookings &amp; payments, and showcase what they do.</p><p>For yoga students, YogaTrail aggregates the classes and upcoming events from their favorite teachers &amp; studios into one simple place, providing an overview of their yoga options and making it easy to plan their practice. Users are notified about schedule changes, book classes, private lessons, passes, packages, subscriptions… they can also chat with their teachers and keep up with upcoming local yoga events and happenings.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Earth</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>$320K Seed in 2014</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Marketplaces</span>, <span>500 Startups Batch 10</span>, <span>Women-Focused</span>, <span>Health and Wellness</span>, <span>Impact Investing</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/YogaTrail' rel='nofollow'>@YogaTrail</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://www.yogatrail.com/blog/' rel='nofollow'>http://www.yogatrail.com/blog/</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://yogatrail.com' rel='nofollow'>yogatrail.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/350/894/350894-c8e764927d5794519c392064451b71f63a9fa8f1.png?1404872226' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/350/895/350895-5dbe5a8b20e36d1b8173c7eae8c3e32d852e6000.jpeg?1404872297' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/404/312/404312-0bdf0df6b97558ad847adf3c65b51f00e0216fc2.png?1411498847' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/533796-yogatrail-app-ios?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;YogaTrail&quot; href='https://angel.co/yogatrail' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/533796-yogatrail-app-ios?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'>YogaTrail App - iOS</a></div>YOGATRAIL connects yogis with their personal yoga world </div><div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/533797-yogatrail-app-android?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;YogaTrail&quot; href='https://angel.co/yogatrail' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/533797-yogatrail-app-android?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'>YogaTrail App - Android</a></div>YOGATRAIL connects yogis with their personal yoga world </div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Add testimonials, product launches, and photos that highlight your company</div>Add Highlight</div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at YogaTrail</h3><ul><li><div>Design Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/yogatrail/jobs/133644-designer' rel='nofollow'>Designer</a><div>Earth·Full Time<span></span><span>·$10K – $30K · 0.1% – 0.5%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to YogaTrail</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Marketing Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/yogatrail/jobs/16351-marketing-guru-growth-hacker' rel='nofollow'>Marketing Guru &amp; Growth Hacker</a><div>Earth·Full Time<span></span><span>·$35K – $80K · 0.1% – 0.4%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to YogaTrail</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>YogaTrail Team</h3><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/alexklein' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/alexklein' rel='nofollow'>Alex Klein</a><span>,</span></div><div>Co-founder/CEO at <a href='https://angel.co/yogatrail' title=&quot;YogaTrail&quot; rel='nofollow'><span>@</span><span>YogaTrail</span></a>.

About 30% of the Very dev team works out of HQ in Chattanooga, TN, and the other 70% work remotely from various locations across the United States. &nbsp;Currently, the Guardian Trust staff works full-time in Clearwater, FL. However, we see the benefit of remote work and welcome engineers who would like to work mostly remote. We ask that from time to time you come to the office to work directly with our staff using our trust management software. Especially in the beginning, we feel it’s essential to fully understand our workflows and advise on system improvement. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>What You’ll Be Working On</span></p><p><span>Guardian in collaboration with Very, has built custom web-based CRM software to manage back-office workflows and the day-to-day operations of Trust management. You will have the opportunity to shape and grow the user experience to facilitate intuitive and efficient use. The web application integrates with a robust accounting system as well as a check-writing service. There is a strong focus on availability in the face of degraded performance from integrations. As such, you will be able to leverage the strengths of Elixir to continue providing a high-quality experience as part of the Guardian team.</span></p><ul><li><span>Elixir (Phoenix)</span></li><li><span>JavaScript (React)</span></li><li><span>Redis</span></li><li><span>Postgres</span></li><li><span>AWS</span></li><li><span>Heroku</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This Role: Senior Software Engineer</span></p><p><span>Your job will be to not only add on to our platform, but also to listen to the team using it and make continuous recommendations for improvement. While the Guardian Trust team doesn’t have a degree in programming, they truly understand leveraging smart software and taking care of their customers. </span></p><p><span>We’ve got lofty goals for growth— striving to help as many people with disabilities as possible.

There’s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products you’ve already bought. It’s irritating for the end user and counterproductive for the company attempting to sell their products or services. Using our tooling marketers can refine their targeting such that the ads are only shown to people who have shown genuine interest.<br /><br />WORKING AT DRIFTROCK<br /><br />Driftrock’s tooling provides our users with a way to receive, transform, track and optimise leads from social channels. Currently these tools look and feel very separate so we’re in the process of bringing them together, with the view to having Driftrock be more of a platform than a set of tools. Other problems we’re solving, and are looking to solve in the near future, include:<br />. How to securely and safely handle personally identifying information;<br />. How to enrich incoming data with information that will help our users decide on the best next steps for their leads;<br />. What reports to provide to our users such that they can see if their efforts are resulting in quality leads and what they can do to improve.<br /><br />The technology is a mixture of Ruby, Elixir and React applications hosted on Kubernetes and Google Cloud. We make use of Redis and Postgres for data storage and RabbitMQ for event processing.<br /><br />You will be expected to:<br />. Build RESTful APIs, event-based systems and front-end applications;<br />. Work with well-known public APIs like Facebook and LinkedIn;<br />. Design and improve user experience;<br />. Support production systems;<br />. Manage cloud infrastructure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE TEAM<br /><br />We’re a small team of 15 people at Driftrock but we’re growing. Our product development team is 7 people with 6 developers and 1 CTO, this means that anyone we bring in can have a huge impact on the culture and practices of the team. <br /><br />We believe in continuous improvement and we are constantly refining and improving how we work and communicate. One of the ways we do this is by performing fortnightly retrospectives, which are often run by different team members. <br /><br />Currently we make use of daily standups and weekly prioritisation meetings to ensure we're pulling in the same direction and maintaining our focus of delivering value to our end users early and often.<br /><br />ABOUT YOU<br /><br />. You should be keen to learn and improve technical, product and personal skills;<br />. You want to be involved in crafting products whilst building on the culture and process of the product team;<br />. You are happy working in a small team, collaborating closely with other engineers as well as our product and sales teams;<br />. You can provide new and diverse viewpoints for our technical and product discussions;<br />. You are interested in agile practices such as continuous delivery, TDD, pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives;<br />. You are keen to ensure there is a high standard of quality and security in the software we produce as a team;<br />. You have had some exposure to Ruby, Elixir or Javascript (we do not expect you to have experience in all of those languages); <br />. You have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br /><br />The interview process has some flexibility but is primarily made up of the following stages:<br /><br />. An initial phone conversation with an engineer;<br />. A take home technical test/coding challenge;<br />. Followed by an on-site pairing interview, where we'll build on your code challenge solution. We then do an informal problem solving task and we finish up with an informal chat with the rest of the team;<br /><br />We try our hardest to reduce the amount of stress involved in the process, we’re not trying to catch you out with trick questions and if at any point (even on the take home test) you have any questions for us we encourage you to ask them.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />. You will work with passionate and smart people, in an environment where we firmly believe in sharing knowledge;<br />. You will be an integral part of a growing and innovative tech startup;<br />. You can be enrolled to the Company’s pension scheme;<br />. The company atmosphere is social and friendly; <br />.
