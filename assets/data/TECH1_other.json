This involves a lot of really cool software (mostly written in a mix of Python and Go, and with user-facing tools in PHP and Javascript) that helps us make magical features at all layers of the traditional hosting stack: distributed and redundant storage, automated container orchestration, highly-available applications and services, fast creation and replication of environments, etc.</p><p>The company is entirely distributed with an HQ in Paris that 10-15% of the company works out of.

Let me introduceyou to our company and engineering team.</p><p>Tripshot was formed in 2014 with a mission to &quot;optimize thecommute&quot;. After observing the challenges large employers face gettingtheir employees to and from work in crowded metro areas, we askedourselves how we can help.  With our backgrounds covering softwareproduct development, large-scale SAAS deployments, and selling andsupporting large enterprises, we set upon our present course todeliver the best solution to this problem.</p><p>Coming off recent sales wins, we're excited to announce that we'reexpanding the engineering team.</p><p>But before diving into what we're looking for, its fair to explainwhat our team is all about. Tripshot engineering culture emphasizes:</p><ol><li><p>Meritocracy. Good ideas come from everywhere, and we encouragehealthy discussion and debate on the team.</p></li><li><p>Focus on the important stuff. No bikeshedding. Differentiate thebusiness by tackling the difficult problems. Transportation is ripewith meaty problems in need of well engineered solutions.</p></li><li><p>Ownership. Find people with the skills, experience, and maturity toown a problem but know when they need to ask for help - then let themloose. Tripshot is a fully distributed company, and since everyoneworks from home we rely on people who can own problems, and deliversolutions.</p></li><li><p>Not all tech is created equal. We love static typing, and our techstack reflects that fact. Backend services are all written inHaskell. Writing Haskell is sheer joy and highly productive.  All webapplications are developed in GWT, in our opinion the most mature ofthe &quot;static language to javascript&quot; compilers.</p></li></ol><p>The next addition to the Tripshot engineering team will help with boththe backend and web apps. Most of our new features require changes toboth in roughly 75/25 proportion, but varies depending on the task.</p><p>Requirements:</p><ul><li><p>Haskell experience is an absolute requirement. Personal projects arefine if they can be shared with us.</p></li><li><p>Java experience preferred. Its not necessary to have worked with GWTbefore, but that would be a bonus.</p></li><li><p>Highly motivated individual with excellent personal time managementskills. You will be working from home.</p></li><li><p>Excellent analytical skills. Our roadmap is full of interestingproblems requiring non-trivial algorithm design.</p></li><li><p>Must be eligible to work in the US.</p></li></ul><p>Tripshot is committed to equal employment opportunity without regardfor race, color, national origin, ethnicity, gender, protected veteranstatus, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion.</p>        </div>        <h4>To Apply</h4>        <p>Send resume to <span><span>apply-9101</span> [at] <span>functionaljobs [dot] com</span></span></p>    </div>",
