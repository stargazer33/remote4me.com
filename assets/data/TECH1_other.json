This is important because the centralized powers of today extract our data and sell it to the highest bidder, to our detriment. We can fix that. Federated protocols for messaging, microblogging, as well as distributed network architectures for payments, identity and organization are well underway. We are missing a consumer product that enables users to move away from data repositories centralized in the hands of big tech so they can safely and privately interact with digital technology. We need a new personal computing platform that enables this. And we need your help to build that platform.</span></p><p><span>Our organization is a values driven cooperative that prioritizes people and our planet over profit. We aim to have a global and positive impact on people’s lives by creating technology that works for people, instead of trying to extract data or money from them. We value open and open source software We look for strong values-driven people who share our vision. We look forward to telling you more about our vision, our values and what we are building.</span></p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li><span>*Nix experience</span></li><li><span>CI/CD development</span></li><li><span>Ability to independently architect an application</span></li><li><span>Proficiency in multiple programming languages (e.g. javascript, python, C)</span></li><li><span>Ability to learn a new language quickly (e.g. rust)</span></li><li><span>Community participation and management</span></li><li><span>Security minded (ability to architect for security)</span></li><li><span>Analytic communication skills</span></li><li><span>[Optional] Ability to work remote</span></li><li><span>[Optional] Machine learning affinity</span></li></ul><p><strong>Role</strong></p><p><span>We are looking for a fun and skilled full-time </span><em><span>backend engineer</span></em><span> to join our diverse and distributed team.
