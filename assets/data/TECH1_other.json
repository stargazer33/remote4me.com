There’s no excuse for being chased around the internet by images of products you’ve already bought. It’s irritating for the end user and counterproductive for the company attempting to sell their products or services. Using our tooling marketers can refine their targeting such that the ads are only shown to people who have shown genuine interest.<br /><br />WORKING AT DRIFTROCK<br /><br />Driftrock’s tooling provides our users with a way to receive, transform, track and optimise leads from social channels. Currently these tools look and feel very separate so we’re in the process of bringing them together, with the view to having Driftrock be more of a platform than a set of tools. Other problems we’re solving, and are looking to solve in the near future, include:<br />. How to securely and safely handle personally identifying information;<br />. How to enrich incoming data with information that will help our users decide on the best next steps for their leads;<br />. What reports to provide to our users such that they can see if their efforts are resulting in quality leads and what they can do to improve.<br /><br />The technology is a mixture of Ruby, Elixir and React applications hosted on Kubernetes and Google Cloud. We make use of Redis and Postgres for data storage and RabbitMQ for event processing.<br /><br />You will be expected to:<br />. Build RESTful APIs, event-based systems and front-end applications;<br />. Work with well-known public APIs like Facebook and LinkedIn;<br />. Design and improve user experience;<br />. Support production systems;<br />. Manage cloud infrastructure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE TEAM<br /><br />We’re a small team of 15 people at Driftrock but we’re growing. Our product development team is 7 people with 6 developers and 1 CTO, this means that anyone we bring in can have a huge impact on the culture and practices of the team. <br /><br />We believe in continuous improvement and we are constantly refining and improving how we work and communicate. One of the ways we do this is by performing fortnightly retrospectives, which are often run by different team members. <br /><br />Currently we make use of daily standups and weekly prioritisation meetings to ensure we're pulling in the same direction and maintaining our focus of delivering value to our end users early and often.<br /><br />ABOUT YOU<br /><br />. You should be keen to learn and improve technical, product and personal skills;<br />. You want to be involved in crafting products whilst building on the culture and process of the product team;<br />. You are happy working in a small team, collaborating closely with other engineers as well as our product and sales teams;<br />. You can provide new and diverse viewpoints for our technical and product discussions;<br />. You are interested in agile practices such as continuous delivery, TDD, pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives;<br />. You are keen to ensure there is a high standard of quality and security in the software we produce as a team;<br />. You have had some exposure to Ruby, Elixir or Javascript (we do not expect you to have experience in all of those languages); <br />. You have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br /><br />The interview process has some flexibility but is primarily made up of the following stages:<br /><br />. An initial phone conversation with an engineer;<br />. A take home technical test/coding challenge;<br />. Followed by an on-site pairing interview, where we'll build on your code challenge solution. We then do an informal problem solving task and we finish up with an informal chat with the rest of the team;<br /><br />We try our hardest to reduce the amount of stress involved in the process, we’re not trying to catch you out with trick questions and if at any point (even on the take home test) you have any questions for us we encourage you to ask them.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />. You will work with passionate and smart people, in an environment where we firmly believe in sharing knowledge;<br />. You will be an integral part of a growing and innovative tech startup;<br />. You can be enrolled to the Company’s pension scheme;<br />. The company atmosphere is social and friendly; <br />. You will be part of fun monthly team events.<br /><br /><br />We will not be considering any recruitment agencies for this role.<br /><br />&quot;By applying for this job you hereby give us permission to store your data on our secure applicant tracking system and to contact you with regards to Driftrock Ltd and our job opportunities. We will store your data for a year before deleting all individually identifiable information. If you wish data to be deleted sooner, respond to this email requesting the deletion of your data&quot;."

We're looking for people who love to tinker with computers (hardware and software), who work with text terminals all the time (and prefer it!), and who work well with limited management (i.e., take initiative). People who like to track down problems hidden in haystacks and solve them with solutions that prevent that <em>category</em> of problems in the future.&nbsp; Does this describe you?</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>enough experience to dive in quickly and be up-to-speed quickly</li><li>ability to work on multiple tasks simultaneously</li><li>strong coding skills, of course (essential familiarity:&nbsp; ruby, bash; very helpful:&nbsp; mechanize, xpath, text processing; extras: perl, lua, mysql)</li><li>self-motivated and objective-based (we don't care about face time)</li><li>Debian or Ubuntu experience is very helpful; working in Linux essential</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Details</strong></p><p>Work remotely from anywhere (many employees do so full-time, others on occasion), in-person routinely in Los Angeles, or on-site in Huntersville, North Carolina.</p><p>Looking for mid-level, but will consider junior and senior level as well, as long as you have been coding as a hobby for a long time (in the case of the former), and aren't stuck in your ways (in the case of the latter).</p><p>Challenging, but supportive environment with a fun team that knows how to balance life and work.</p><p>Full-time. Competitive compensation. Planning to hire immediately.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>No recruiters please.</em></p><p><strong>About Data Driven Safety</strong></p><p>How DDS is described by our employees: &quot;No bs, no corporate politics, no dress code, financially-secure company, flexible work schedules, objective-based approach, employees all over the world, telecommuting is as normal as on-site, love what I do (at least most days), ... what did you want me to say again?&quot;</p><p>DDS is a small company with a close-knit employee group. We have maintained a nearly 100% client and employee retention rate. We offer competitive salary and benefit packages to smart, loyal, creative thinkers that excel at problem solving.</p><p>DDS collects public record data (e.g., arrest, crash, judicial, etc.) directly from thousands of governmental agencies. This information fuels a number of unique services that are utilized nationally by large and small corporations, a state risk pool, municipalities, educational institutions, hospital systems and insurance underwriters. Our only publicly marketed service is Envision, a comprehensive driver improvement platform. However, most of our growth during the past several years has been driven by a set of predictive underwriting, fraud prevention and claims management services that were created at the request of our customers in the automotive and health care industries.</p><p>Data Driven Safety, LLC is dedicated to improving public safety. We have been in existence since 2009 and are owned through the Graham Group, a billion-dollar investment vehicle.</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> Odd hours celebrated; anywhere in the world acceptable.  If you decide to work from our Huntersville office, there's a Jimmy John's right outside.  And to eat what you find there, we have a large, private, outdoor patio.  Before and after, have some decent espresso (well, iperEspresso) in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> Please include, in your first message, the phrase, &quot;my favorite color is [color]&quot;, replacing [color] with any color (doesn't actually have to be your favorite, if that's a secret.  Also, find and report the error in the previous sentence.  No phone calls, thanks.</p>"

We make use of Redis and Postgres for data storage and RabbitMQ for event processing.<br /><br />You will be expected to:<br /><br />* Build RESTful APIs, event-based systems and front-end applications; <br />* Work with well-known public APIs like Facebook and LinkedIn; <br />* Design and improve user experience; <br />* Support production systems; <br />* Manage cloud infrastructure.<br /><br />ABOUT THE TEAM<br /><br />We’re a small team of 15 people at Driftrock but we’re growing. Our product development team is 7 people with 6 developers and 1 CTO, this means that anyone we bring in can have a huge impact on the culture and practices of the team.<br /><br />We believe in continuous improvement and we are constantly refining and improving how we work and communicate. One of the ways we do this is by performing fortnightly retrospectives, which are often run by different team members.<br /><br />Currently we make use of daily standups and weekly prioritisation meetings to ensure we're pulling in the same direction and maintaining our focus of delivering value to our end users early and often.<br /><br />ABOUT YOU<br /><br />* You should be keen to learn and improve technical, product and personal skills; <br />* You want to be involved in crafting products whilst building on the culture and process of the product team; <br />* You are happy working in a small team, collaborating closely with other engineers as well as our product and sales teams; <br />* You can provide new and diverse viewpoints for our technical and product discussions; <br />* You are interested in agile practices such as continuous delivery, TDD, pair programming, code reviews and retrospectives; <br />* You are keen to ensure there is a high standard of quality and security in the software we produce as a team; <br />* You are interested in mentoring and coach other team members; <br />* You have had some exposure to Ruby, Elixir or Javascript (we do not expect you to have experience in all of those languages); <br />* You have the right to work in the UK.<br /><br />WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?<br /><br />The interview process has some flexibility but is primarily made up of the following stages:<br /><br />* An initial phone conversation with an engineer; <br />* A take home technical test/coding challenge; <br />* Followed by an on-site pairing interview, where we'll build on your code challenge solution. We then do an informal problem solving task and we finish up with an informal chat with the rest of the team. <br /><br />We try our hardest to reduce the amount of stress involved in the process, we’re not trying to catch you out with trick questions and if at any point (even on the take home test) you have any questions for us we encourage you to ask them.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />* You will work with passionate and smart people, in an environment where we firmly believe in sharing knowledge; <br />* You will be an integral part of a growing and innovative tech startup; <br />* You can be enrolled to the Company’s pension scheme; <br />* The company atmosphere is social and friendly; <br />* You will be part of fun monthly team events.<br /><br />We will not be considering any recruitment agencies for this role.<br /><br />&quot;By applying for this job you hereby give us permission to store your data on our secure applicant tracking system and to contact you with regards to Driftrock Ltd and our job opportunities. We will store your data for a year before deleting all individually identifiable information. If you wish data to be deleted sooner, respond to this email requesting the deletion of your data&quot;."
