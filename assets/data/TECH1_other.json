Read on!</p><br /><p>Pinch is a private photo sharing app that is currently live (rough MVP) on both iOS and Android. Pinch is not yet another social network, but a platform to share moments and memories with the people closest to you. We have a heavy emphasis on privacy and will never share our users data. We do have firm plans to monetise so this is not one of those startups where we hope to scale to 1M users before we figure out how to make money.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We've got a great and growing team (3 at the moment), and our product is live and ready to scale. All we need is you!</p><br /><p><strong>You are&hellip;</strong></p><br /><p>A full-stack engineer/developer, or a back-end engineer with a desire to step up to become one. More than that, you&rsquo;re an architect: you can build systems rather than just write software. You have demonstrably extensive experience of:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Back-end technologies, including Elixir and Phoenix</li><br /><li>Database technologies, both SQL and NoSQL, including Postgres</li><br /><li>Cloud technologies, especially Google Cloud Platform, with the knowledge necessary to reconfigure and tune for performance and cost effectiveness</li><br /><li>Willing to put in up to 10 hours a week for a pure equity stake in this business</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>You might also have:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience of front-end frameworks such as React Native or Flutter (extra points for Flutter)</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Basically, we&rsquo;re looking for creativity and intelligence: someone who, like us, wants to make something special, and can see what needs to be done to our backend infrastructure to make that happen. If we&rsquo;ve made choices that could be better, you&rsquo;re happy to tell us.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Who the hell are we?</strong></p><br /><p>Founding team already in place, two of our founders have startup/exit experience, and all three are committed to building an awesome company from the ground up, ideally Remote first. We all have day jobs but routinely put in 10-20+ hours a week to get this over the line.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are aiming for a Seed investment in the next 6 months and have very clear milestones of what we need to hit to support that.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Download the app to see where we are at, again very early days but traction already is strong:</p><br /><p>https://onelink.to/8jgy9n</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We don&rsquo;t discriminate.
