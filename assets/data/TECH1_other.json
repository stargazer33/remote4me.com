We are post product, post revenue and growing fast in the US and Canada.   <br>   <br>Our team is small, nimble, and devoted to making our customers lives easier with simple to use technology. We envision a world where distributors using our tools are more efficient and able to build stronger relationships with their customers.   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>   <br>We are looking for an engineer who is excited to make significant contributions to our API and other backend systems.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p><p>Our Client Services Team is now on the lookout for an experienced Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>The Client Domain is all about innovation. Here we shape our products to satisfy the needs of our heterogeneous customer base. To achieve this you will collaborate closely with the Frontend Engineers of the Client Team to design and implement bespoke APIs and services that will be used by our different products and brands.&nbsp;</p><p>The Client Services Team is tasked with the development of all backend services &nbsp;client applications, i.e. primarily the &nbsp;API Gateway of our platform but also client-related services such as authentication, internationalisation or content management and other backend services that allow us to provide a unique experience to a specific segment of our users. Being our platform’s gateway to the outside world, scalability and responsiveness is of utmost importance in the Client Domain. It is worth noting that the traffic pattern of our platform will not only be dictated by the sporting calendar but also by the sometimes unpredictable behaviour of our users.&nbsp;</p><p>By joining our team you will be working primarily in Elixir but you will also influence the full lifecycle of our software, starting with architectural and design decisions, all the way to the implementation, testing and monitoring of the resulting services.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location.

You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €55k-75k annually, depending on your background and experience.

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.</p><p>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;<em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.</p><p>See how our clients&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we've received</a>&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/holiday-collaboration-with-velodrome-coffee/' rel='nofollow'>holiday gifts</a>&nbsp;each year. Or, if you're a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/seaworthy/' rel='nofollow'>Seaworthy</a>, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!</p><p><strong><strong>A Day In The Life</strong></strong></p><p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p><p><strong><strong>What Does Success Look Like?</strong></strong></p><p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p><p>After this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<strong><em>Welcome aboard!</em></strong></p><p><strong>Ongoing Support</strong></p><p>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:</p><ul><li>Individual quarterly goal progress</li><li>Project status / team issues / weekly retro</li><li>Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire</li></ul><p><strong>Quarterly and Annual Reviews</strong></p><p>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We're here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.</p><p><strong><strong>Experience and Results At Every Level</strong></strong></p><p>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019.

Examples of projects you might work on include: building out features like improved venue search, or running experiments to improve the usability of our search results. Over time you will be directly responsible for features on the search engine results page (SERP) and take ownership over product maintenance and improvement.   <br>   <br>We are a remote company, we empower our team to work wherever they want around the world. That means you have to be self-directed and self-motivated to succeed. If that seems awesome and you like the idea of our core values -- Build trust, Question assumptions, and Validate direction -- you'll fit right in.   <br>   <br>What you will do:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Lead development of search projects by taking vague problems, scoping them into high impact projects, and executing them against a set of success criteria.   <br>   <br>* Take responsibility for solving product issues – both big and small.   <br>   <br>* Implement and/or create algorithms to improve the content we present on the SERP.   <br>   <br>* Collaborate with peers on product brainstorms, technical design discussions, pair programming sessions and code reviews.   <br>   <br>* Write pragmatic, testable code that works consistently and is performant.   <br>   <br>* In time, take leadership responsibility for several senior engineers, mentoring them and helping them grow at DuckDuckGo.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>What we are looking for:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Significant backend engineering experience (around 6+ years).   <br>   <br>* Expertise working on the backend side of at least one large application.   <br>   <br>* Experience in leading engineering teams of 3+ people.   <br>   <br>* Effective project management skills.   <br>   <br>* Ability to develop and use complicated data structures and algorithms. This includes understanding the fundamentals, as well as navigating and improving existing code (ours is mostly written with Perl).   <br>   <br>* Creative problem solvers and risk takers. You like to take initiative in pushing a project forward but know when to get others involved.   <br>   <br>* Excellent communication skills. You can validate and communicate your decisions clearly.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Other things to know:   <br>   <br>   <br>* We are a small, remote team in different time zones and communicate with a variety of tools throughout the day. You should feel comfortable with the intricacies of this type of work situation.   <br>   <br>* Sometimes we meet up! You can expect to travel at least 2x a year: once for our all-hands meetup and another for a team retreat (each ~4-5 days)   <br>   <br>* We want to have a major impact on raising the standard of trust online. To do this we believe in a focused approach, with company-wide objectives, and with each team member working on a single top priority at a time.   <br>   <br>* Our work philosophy is built upon empowered project management. All team members have opportunities to run projects.   <br>   <br>* All projects are run transparently, and we encourage everyone to participate in areas of interest throughout the company. Anyone and everyone can (and should) ask questions and offer feedback around the product and internal projects.   <br>   <br>* We try to exemplify our values (build trust, question assumptions, and validate direction) in everything we do.   <br>   <br>* While this is a full time job, we offer a flexible work arrangement with no core hours and expect an average commitment of 40 hours per week.   <br>   <br>* We support professional development of our team members through career advisory and a learning stipend, reinforcing our culture of growth and skill building.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>If you think you might thrive in this environment, we would love to hear from you using the application below.  </div> </div>",

You won't miss out of office conversations, and you won't have to learn to drive a telepresence robot.   <br>   <br>We offer robust healthcare (dental, medical, vision), paid time off, and a generous equipment budget.   <br>   <br>## About the role   <br>   <br>You'll be the primary caretaker of the Erlang web application powering our product, as well as collaborating Ruby on Rails services and the virtual infrastructure they run on.   <br>   <br>Because the Erlang system has no direct user interface, you'll work closely with our iOS, Android, and frontend web engineers to evolve the backend's functionality to solve new problems, all while improving performance and ensuring reliability.   <br>   <br>You'll be helping us make our development cycles more efficient by owning the technical design and implementation of new features, extending our automated test suite to reduce the need for manual testing, and shipping fixes on a regular basis.   <br>   <br>You'll have opportunities to flex your skills around automated deployments, automated testing, tracing and visibility, and learn from others in a collaborative environment.   <br>   <br>In time, you'll also help onboard and mentor junior engineers as we grow our team.   <br>   <br>This is a full-time position open to anyone who can work legally in the United States.   <br>   <br>## About you   <br>   <br>We're looking for a senior-level engineer to own the backend systems powering our product.   <br>   <br>### Key skills   <br>   <br>* 4+ years professional experience implementing and operating HTTP web services   <br>* 2+ years professional experience working with Erlang, Elixir, or another functional programming language like Clojure or Haskell   <br> &nbsp;**Or:**&nbsp;Substantive OSS contributions in these languages, in lieu of professional experience   <br>* Confident use of SQL, relational storage, and key/value storage to optimize for correctness and performance   <br>* A willingness to mentor other engineers and to share your knowledge to help them grow   <br>* The ability to quickly convey ideas, opinions, and technical details in written English   <br>* Ability to participate in an on-call rotation to respond to and resolve (rare ⭐️) major incidents and outages affecting our stack   <br>* Able to work 8-5 Eastern Standard Time ± 3 hours, to facilitate realtime collaboration when needed   <br>   <br>The following aren't requirements, but be sure to mention them if they apply to you:   <br>   <br>* Experience working with Amazon Web Services or one of the other major cloud providers, with an emphasis on configuration languages and infrastructure-as-code   <br>* Experience with Docker or other common containerization platforms   <br>* A working knowledge of Ruby or JavaScript   <br>   <br>### Technologies   <br>   <br>We take a &quot;reasoned opinions, weakly held&quot; approach to tools, and resist letting those tools define our identity. That said, we've had positive experiences with (and made significant investments in) the following, which does mean you'll be working with them at least in the medium term:   <br>   <br>* Erlang/OTP (using the Cowboy and Hackney libraries heavily)   <br>* Ruby on Rails   <br>* Clojure   <br>* PostgreSQL   <br>* Amazon Web Services   <br>   <br>If this sounds like a fun challenge and your kind of environment, drop us a line and let's talk!   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- US-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p><p>Our Client Services Team is now on the lookout for a Senior Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>The Client Domain is all about innovation. Here we shape our products to satisfy the needs of our heterogeneous customer base. To achieve this you will collaborate closely with the Frontend Engineers of the Client Team to design and implement bespoke APIs and services that will be used by our different products and brands.</p><p>The Client Services Team is tasked with the development of all backend services required by our client applications, i.e. primarily the &nbsp;API Gateway of our platform but also client-related services such as authentication, internationalisation or content management and other backend services that allow us to provide a unique experience to a specific segment of our users. Being our platform’s gateway to the outside world, scalability and responsiveness is of utmost importance in the Client Domain. It is worth noting that the traffic pattern of our platform will not only be dictated by the sporting calendar but also by the sometimes unpredictable behaviour of our users.</p><p>By joining our team you will be working primarily in Elixir but you will also influence the full lifecycle of our software, starting with architectural and design decisions, all the way to the implementation, testing and monitoring of the resulting services.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €65k-90k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li><p>5+ years experience in developing complex web and mobile applications with JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Working experience with at least one statically typed flavour of JavaScript</p></li><li><p>Solid experience with at least one main frontend framework</p></li><li><p>Good knowledge of HTML and CSS standards</p></li><li><p>Proficient user of a modern development toolchain: linters, package managers, bundlers, Git, continuous integration pipelines</p></li><li><p>Familiarity with automated testing frameworks</p></li><li><p>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</p></li><li><p>Interest in taking full ownership of your applications and managing them in a production environment including the troubleshooting of live incidents</p></li><li><p>Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build</p></li><li><p>Highly process driven and eager to learn</p></li><li><p>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</p></li><li><p>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</p></li></ul>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/senior-software-engineer-elixir?source=Stack%20Overflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
