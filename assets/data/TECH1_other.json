We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p>\n <p>Our Client Services Team is now on the lookout for an experienced Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p>\n <p><strong>The Team</strong></p>\n <p>The Client Domain is all about innovation. Here we shape our products to satisfy the needs of our heterogeneous customer base. To achieve this you will collaborate closely with the Frontend Engineers of the Client Team to design and implement bespoke APIs and services that will be used by our different products and brands.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>The Client Services Team is tasked with the development of all backend services &nbsp;client applications, i.e. primarily the &nbsp;API Gateway of our platform but also client-related services such as authentication, internationalisation or content management and other backend services that allow us to provide a unique experience to a specific segment of our users. Being our platform’s gateway to the outside world, scalability and responsiveness is of utmost importance in the Client Domain. It is worth noting that the traffic pattern of our platform will not only be dictated by the sporting calendar but also by the sometimes unpredictable behaviour of our users.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>By joining our team you will be working primarily in Elixir but you will also influence the full lifecycle of our software, starting with architectural and design decisions, all the way to the implementation, testing and monitoring of the resulting services.</p>\n <p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p>\n <p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p>\n <p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>\n <p>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €55k-75k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p>\n <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><p>3+ years of professional software development experience, with at least 1 years of professional experience using Elixir</p></li>\n  <li><p>Good knowledge of functional and concurrent programming, as well as distributed systems</p></li>\n  <li><p>Good knowledge of microservice architecture, message-based communication and stream processing</p></li>\n  <li><p>Interest in test automation, cloud and containerization technologies, code instrumentation and CI/CD pipelines</p></li>\n  <li><p>Interest in taking full ownership of your services including managing them in a production environment</p></li>\n  <li><p>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</p></li>\n  <li><p>Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build</p></li>\n  <li><p>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</p></li>\n  <li><p>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</p></li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/software-engineer-elixir/c/new?source=Stack%20Overflow&amp;utm_source=stack_overflow&amp;utm_medium=job&amp;utm_campaign=client_elixir' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Competitive Compensation</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span> </li> \n</ul>",

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.</p>\n <p>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;<em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.</p>\n <p>See how our clients&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we've received</a>&nbsp;so far.

We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!</p>\n <p><strong><strong>A Day In The Life</strong></strong></p>\n <p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p>\n <p><strong><strong>What Does Success Look Like?</strong></strong></p>\n <p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p>\n <p>After this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<strong><em>Welcome aboard!</em></strong></p>\n <p><strong>Ongoing Support</strong></p>\n <p>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Individual quarterly goal progress</li>\n  <li>Project status / team issues / weekly retro</li>\n  <li>Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Quarterly and Annual Reviews</strong></p>\n <p>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We're here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>Experience and Results At Every Level</strong></strong></p>\n <p>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019.

Examples of projects you might work on include: building out features like improved venue search, or running experiments to improve the usability of our search results. Over time you will be directly responsible for features on the search engine results page (SERP) and take ownership over product maintenance and improvement. \n  <br> \n  <br>We are a remote company, we empower our team to work wherever they want around the world.

This stretches from bet placement to bet settlement, including advanced features such as an event- and player-based risk management, ability to build complex bets such as from outcomes with dependent probabilities, or continuous calculation of early settlement offers (cash out). \n  <br> \n  <br>Sub-second latency is welcomed but high throughput has higher priority in the Betting domain. The goal is building a sports betting platform where no bet is rejected due to lack of capacity in the system. Bet settlement is worth a special mention as the platform needs to be able to quickly evaluate hundreds of thousands of bets upon the resulting of an underlying sporting event. \n  <br> \n  <br>You will be working on developing these services primarily in Go and have a voice in the architectural decisions surrounding them. \n  <br> \n  <br>Remote Work \n  <br> \n  <br>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location.

That said, we've had positive experiences with (and made significant investments in) the following, which does mean you'll be working with them at least in the medium term: \n  <br> \n  <br>* Erlang/OTP (using the Cowboy and Hackney libraries heavily) \n  <br>* Ruby on Rails \n  <br>* Clojure \n  <br>* PostgreSQL \n  <br>* Amazon Web Services \n  <br> \n  <br>If this sounds like a fun challenge and your kind of environment, drop us a line and let's talk! \n  <br> \n  <br>#Location \n  <br>- US-only \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.</p>\n <p>Our Client Services Team is now on the lookout for a Senior Software Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.</p>\n <p><strong>The Team</strong></p>\n <p>The Client Domain is all about innovation. Here we shape our products to satisfy the needs of our heterogeneous customer base. To achieve this you will collaborate closely with the Frontend Engineers of the Client Team to design and implement bespoke APIs and services that will be used by our different products and brands.</p>\n <p>The Client Services Team is tasked with the development of all backend services required by our client applications, i.e. primarily the &nbsp;API Gateway of our platform but also client-related services such as authentication, internationalisation or content management and other backend services that allow us to provide a unique experience to a specific segment of our users. Being our platform’s gateway to the outside world, scalability and responsiveness is of utmost importance in the Client Domain. It is worth noting that the traffic pattern of our platform will not only be dictated by the sporting calendar but also by the sometimes unpredictable behaviour of our users.</p>\n <p>By joining our team you will be working primarily in Elixir but you will also influence the full lifecycle of our software, starting with architectural and design decisions, all the way to the implementation, testing and monitoring of the resulting services.</p>\n <p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p>\n <p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location.
