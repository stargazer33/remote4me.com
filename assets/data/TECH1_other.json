This job ad might not be for you. May you find a job you are happy in either way!</p><p>You like to work independently, you are pragmatic, and you have the confidence to take on hard problems lacking a detailed spec. You value simple solutions over over-engineered ones. Chances are things will change down the line and changing something simple, or better yet something that was never made, is much easier than changing a monstrosity. You should not need or want anyone breathing down your neck to be productive.</p><p>With the formalities out of the way, let me introduce myself: my name is Sebastian, and I am the CTO at Aircloak. Aircloak is a remote company that has built a privacy preserving data processing and analytics engine. Think of it as an SQL database proxy that generates actually anonymized results on the fly.</p><p>There are countless challenging things to do in this job. They range from parsing SQL, to doing extensive query rewriting and optimization, to ensuring that all results produced are safe and fully anonymous irrespective of the level of deviousness on the part of the analyst using the system.</p><p>The skills we are looking for in a candidate are:</p><p></p><pre><code>  - Intelligence and ability to deal with hard trade-offs  - Great communication skills  - The ability to work independently and take ownership of tasks  - A desire to learn and improve</code></pre>The majority of our system is written in Elixir, but we have parts written in Rust and JavaScript as well. You’ll even find some opportunities to write F# if you want that. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus and experience with web development is not going to hurt either.<p>We do not specifically look for someone with experience in our particular stack. It is our experience that people who are smart tend to pick up the required tools very quickly. Likewise it is less interesting to us what your background is. At the end of the day it’s your skills, brains, and experience that matter.</p><p>Our team is exceptional and quite geographically diverse. The company was built as a remote-first company from the beginning, and we really enjoy the benefits this gives us.</p><p>We look forward to getting to know you and welcoming you to our team!</p><p>If you are interested, please write us at jobs [at] aircloak.com</p>",

We do have firm plans to monetise so this is not one of those startups where we hope to scale to 1M users before we figure out how to make money.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We've got a great and growing team (3 at the moment), and our product is live and ready to scale. All we need is you!</p><br /><p><strong>You are&hellip;</strong></p><br /><p>A full-stack engineer/developer, or a back-end engineer with a desire to step up to become one. More than that, you&rsquo;re an architect: you can build systems rather than just write software. You have demonstrably extensive experience of:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Back-end technologies, including Elixir and Phoenix</li><br /><li>Database technologies, both SQL and NoSQL, including Postgres</li><br /><li>Cloud technologies, especially Google Cloud Platform, with the knowledge necessary to reconfigure and tune for performance and cost effectiveness</li><br /><li>Willing to put in up to 10 hours a week for a pure equity stake in this business</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>You might also have:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience of front-end frameworks such as React Native or Flutter (extra points for Flutter)</li><br /></ul><br /><p>Basically, we&rsquo;re looking for creativity and intelligence: someone who, like us, wants to make something special, and can see what needs to be done to our backend infrastructure to make that happen. If we&rsquo;ve made choices that could be better, you&rsquo;re happy to tell us.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Who the hell are we?</strong></p><br /><p>Founding team already in place, two of our founders have startup/exit experience, and all three are committed to building an awesome company from the ground up, ideally Remote first. We all have day jobs but routinely put in 10-20+ hours a week to get this over the line.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are aiming for a Seed investment in the next 6 months and have very clear milestones of what we need to hit to support that.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Download the app to see where we are at, again very early days but traction already is strong:</p><br /><p>https://onelink.to/8jgy9n</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We don&rsquo;t discriminate.

The first version of the new platform was released in 2017 towards institutions and has successfully been rolled out across a set of initial client organisations. In October 2018, the platform was released as Zendy, directly targeted towards individuals. Zendy provides access to&nbsp;around 100 million publication records for free, and an important next milestone is to release Zendy Premium in a first country. Zendy Premium will offer individuals access to paid academic content for an affordable monthly or annual fee.</p><p>We believe in nurturing a creative and open workplace where people enjoy coming to work every day. We are therefore looking for team members who are truly passionate about what they do and that go the extra mile to provide an outstanding service and experiences to the research community that we are serving.
