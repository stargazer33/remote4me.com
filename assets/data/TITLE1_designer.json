We’ve got an ecosystem of apps, live classes, and stellar support. Now we need our next visual designer to bring the same attention to detail to our branding, marketing, and educational materials.</p><p>You come to the table with some experience under your belt. You know how to expand and maintain meticulous brand guidelines. You catch color mismatches that are mere shades off, you bristle at poor kerning, and you know that good design is in the details. You love to draw, and can create masterpieces with the pen tool. You also love to dream and get that our dream is to build a brand that is fun, smart, and approachable.</p><p><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</strong></p><ul><li>At least two years of experience working in marketing design.</li><li>Experience working within strict, existing brand guidelines.</li><li>Experience creating vector illustrations.</li><li>Experience doing time-sensitive production work.</li><li>Experience designing for responsive web.</li><li>Ability to work and communicate effectively in a remote environment.</li><li><strong>Your home base must be located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></p><p>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or You Need a Budget if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (Google us, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside fundingwe’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our Cultural Manifestohas to really&nbsp;<em>click</em>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</p><p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p><p><strong>Todd,&nbsp;</strong>our Chief Strategy Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and experiences our users have in themand knows that process begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;</strong>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</p><p><strong>Lindsey</strong>, our Chief Marketing Officer, is in charge of getting the word out about YNAB, and always finds a fun way to do that. Like our YNAB mix-tape, where-in she wrote and re-recorded budgeting-related lyrics to pop-songs. (We suggest reading the rest of this description while listening to that album.)</p><p><strong>Lauren&nbsp;</strong>is our illustrator/designer. She is single-handedly responsible for almost all of the illustrations you see on our blog/Facebook/Instagram posts, and might be single-handedly responsible for all of the WoW achievement points mentioned on our About Page. We should also mention that she designed and illustrated that page. So yeah, her list of awesome just keeps going and going. Oh, and she writes fantasy novels. Seriously.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional peoplethe kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></p><p><strong>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work pretty much wherever you want (for this particular opening, there are some time-zone requirements). Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</strong></p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Something closer to five is about right. Plus we take two extra weeks for a Holiday break. It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong>The YNAB Meetup</strong></p><p><strong>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</strong></p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). We have a monthly book budget, send people to conferences, give dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.</p><p><strong>International is Absolutely Okay</strong></p><p>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. We are spread all over the world, but for this particular position, we have a strong preference for candidates located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</p><p><strong>If You’re Stateside</strong></p><p>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;<em>and your family.</em>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;<em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Why then, did you muddle through all of that awesomeness?)</p><p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your Bucket List spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;<em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping the YNAB brand come to life and reach wider audiences. I’ll only say that six more times.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Visual Designer…</strong></p><p>As a visual designer at YNAB, you’ll live on&nbsp;<em>two&nbsp;</em>teams. You’ll be a prized resource for our marketing team, churning out ads, landing pages, and illustrations while maintaining the YNAB brand. As a member of the design team you’ll work alongside both UI/UX designers and visual designers to consistently improve the quality of visual design across the YNAB ecosystem. You will be our boots on the ground, protecting our brand with your pixel-perfect attention to detail.</p><p><strong>What Success Looks Like:</strong></p><p>The marketing team marvels at your ability to think big and execute quickly on the smallest of tasks. You roll up your sleeves and deliver what’s needed, sometimes before the marketing team asks for it. Other designers can’t stop praising you for your museum-worthy artwork and strict approach to file management. You’ll probably make our CEO cry from time to time. Our campaigns are so beautiful he can barely look at them without bringing out a tissue. You also make us laugh. We like to laugh.</p><p>You take direction from multiple teams, and communicate freely. You understand that great communication and time management is critical to your success in a remote work environment. When you say it will be done, it will be done. Your teammates don’t even have to think about it.</p><p>You know a great designer loves the very smallest parts of the job. Some call it pixel pushing. Others call it production work. We call it craft. You love tweaking your designs in the browser and communicate easily with developers, including in HTML and CSS. Because that’s how it’s done.</p><p>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem-solving for both creative and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to (devour, really) ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our company: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.</p><p><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></p><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li><li>You have experience with animation and/or know how to prepare artwork for rigging.</li></ul><p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p><ul><li>Attach a PDF of your cover letter. In your cover letter:<ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.</li><li>We love a designer with a perspective. What’s yours? Feel free to touch on your beliefs on how design should be done, what it’s used for, or why it’s important.</li></ul></li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for.</li><li>Please include a portfolio that contains the following (if you are linking to an online portfolio, be sure to include the details below in your cover letter):<ul><li>Examples of design work.</li><li>Your design process (wireframes, interviews, sketches).</li><li>Links to any live work.</li><li>Please state the role you played on each project and specify if certain artwork used in a design was not created by you.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>The Portfolio:</strong></p><p>Note: We greatly appreciate receiving work as a personal portfolio website, Dropbox folder, or PDF. Please do not send a Behance or Dribbble link unless you cannot do otherwise.</p><p>Include:</p><ul><li>Examples of marketing campaign content, landing pages, ads, and other assets.</li><li>Examples of vector artwork you have created.</li><li>Any style guides, brand documentation, or UI kits you have produced.</li><li>Examples of responsive web design.</li><li>Please include personal work only if LABELED AS SUCH. We prize real work with real stories over perfect spec work.</li></ul><p>P.S. If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk01ovh' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>"

If that's you and you have a portfolio to back that up, feel free to quote your hourly or project rate upfront.</p><p>Core Data currently needs an additional HTML5 web designer with react and redux experience to create a major expansion on the company's HTML5-based UI. The existing UI can be seen at this <a href='http://coredata.eu/newui' rel='nofollow'>link</a>. The existing UI is focused on displaying available offers for live (actively in play) sports games and uses a simplified navigation scheme where the user simply selects a sport, then a game, and ultimately selects what wagers are wanted.</p><p>The candidate will need to expand this User Interface to include &quot;prematch&quot; betting. Mockup designs for this have already been prepared <a href='https://coredata.eu/designer.html' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. The enhancement will keep all existing functionality of the live UI, but add a tab/screen for upcoming games that have not yet started. The list of available prematch games is numerous (sometimes in the thousands) and so the navigation scheme will be much more sophisticated than the live (current) navigation scheme. The company's goal is to have a clean, smooth, and intuitive cross-browser product.</p><p>The candidate will be expected to combine their knowledge of aesthetics and intuitive UX principles to create a cutting-edge, crisp, and attractive prematch expansion to the company's UI. The existing UI uses React.JS and Redux, so prior experience with these frameworks is necessary. The backend data to power the UI is provided vi a WebSockets feed and our backend team can make reasonable changes to the feed format if it is necessary to facilitate a speedy project completion.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/193809?reset=False&amp;ra=12ZQuM6F5hBu&amp;oqs=a%3D12ZQuM6F5hBu' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Core Data</h3>            <div><p>First and foremost, we are a software development company owned and operated entirely by professionals with a strong technical background. &nbsp;Since technology is our core focus and software is our principal product, all projects at&nbsp;CDS are important and recognized by the highest levels of management.</p><p>We believe in hiring the best candidates for every position. &nbsp;It is for this reason that we do not restrict ourselves to arbitrary geographical locations. &nbsp;Most of our staff works on a remote basis. &nbsp;Our hiring decisions are based on one's abilities, not location.</p><p>The projects we take on run the gamut.&nbsp; Primarily we are a data and statistics provider with an emphasis on low-latency, real-time data feeds.&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly paid time off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours / work schedules</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

By analyzing reader comments, we provide a &quot;Wikipedia-style&quot; reference page for any article on the net, showing the flaws in any article, line by line. </p><p>By putting discussions into structured data, we can also suppress trolling without resorting to censorship. Come ask us how we do all this. Try the public beta at fiskkit.com, and click on the demo video. <br>Fiskkit is preparing for a roll-out this summer. Stay tuned!!</p><p>The Fiskkit team is passionate about creating the best possible place for people to come together and talk about what matters, relying on smart mechanics instead of our better angels to cut through trolling and BS. </p><p>If you care about making the world a better place, and are looking for a scrappy startup with the ability to change the relationship between people and information forever, drop us a line.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to Fiskkit</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Fiskkit</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>Fiskkit is looking for a multi-talented visual and UX designer to help us make intellectually honest discussion online as simple and intuitive as possible. </p><p>Fiskkit<br>Fiskkit is a platform for in-line news commenting that &quot;turns discourse into data,&quot;&nbsp; making the discussion more useful, factual, productive, accountable, civil and enjoyable. Structured data allows us to statistically quality-check all online news in real time, and empower readers to filter trolling without resorting to censorship or moderation. We released a public beta at the Launch Festival in 2015 and were awarded the Social Impact Award by the Grand Jury.</p><p>Once you go beyond simple nested commenting online, it requires masterful design to minimize the friction so people can engage with news articles honestly and easily. We are engineering for a system, culture and interface that best promotes facts, logical reasoning and civility online by incorporating the latest social science and usability research.</p><p>Fiskkit is bootstrapping to a full launch in 1Q2016, after which we plan to raise funding and grow the team. All positions are full or part-time, with equity based on commitment and experience. </p><p>If you want to help build the capacity for people to have more productive and more civil conversations about the issues that really matter, please reach out to us. Fiskkit is a mission-driven venture, but with a very strong business model.</p></div></div><div><div>Compensation</div><div>$1K–$1K<br>0.5%–2.0%</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Not available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Fiskkit</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/purple-dot-digital-1/jobs/304870-iphone-app-ui-ux-designer-required?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/purple-dot-digital-1/jobs/304870-iphone-app-ui-ux-designer-required?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>iPhone App UI/UX Designer Required</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/purple-dot-digital-1/jobs/304870-iphone-app-ui-ux-designer-required?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Purple Dot Digital</a></div><div>London</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/mobius-network/jobs/341924-lead-product-designer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/mobius-network/jobs/341924-lead-product-designer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Lead Product Designer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/mobius-network/jobs/341924-lead-product-designer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Mobius</a></div><div>San Francisco, Cayman Islands</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/we-carpool-inc/jobs/140701-brand-book-designer-gig?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/we-carpool-inc/jobs/140701-brand-book-designer-gig?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Brand Book designer gig</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/we-carpool-inc/jobs/140701-brand-book-designer-gig?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>We Carpool Blockchain @YCobinatorSS17</a></div><div>Reston, Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/schoolinks/jobs/306982-ui-designer-contractor-remote-ok?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/schoolinks/jobs/306982-ui-designer-contractor-remote-ok?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>UI Designer Contractor - Remote OK</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/schoolinks/jobs/306982-ui-designer-contractor-remote-ok?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>SchooLinks</a></div><div>Austin</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/barn-willow/jobs/149842-visual-designer-contract-part-time?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/barn-willow/jobs/149842-visual-designer-contract-part-time?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Visual Designer (Contract/Part T...</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/barn-willow/jobs/149842-visual-designer-contract-part-time?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Barn &amp; Willow</a></div><div>San Francisco, Palo Alto</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/luckydayapp/jobs/298874-product-designer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/luckydayapp/jobs/298874-product-designer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Product Designer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/luckydayapp/jobs/298874-product-designer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Lucky Day</a></div><div>Los Angeles</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/neptune-financial-inc-nepfin/jobs/268725-product-designer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/neptune-financial-inc-nepfin/jobs/268725-product-designer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Product Designer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/neptune-financial-inc-nepfin/jobs/268725-product-designer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Neptune Financial Inc.

It is a place where people can comment on news in depth, and share their opinions through social media. </p><p>When multiple people have &quot;fisked&quot; the same article, the system produces a page which highlights the flaws or qualities in the text, as determined by a statistical test of significance of the (human-input) tags. In short, it has the potential to fact-check all online news/content in real time.</p><p>Additionally, by allowing users to fisk each other's comments, we create a granular, peer-reviewed discussion of the topic which is much more useful - and useable -  for interested readers. This allows us to build in a Troll Filter which will enable readers to weed out bad-faith commentary, while preserving Fiskkit's &quot;No Censorship&quot; principle. </p><p>It's the future of online engagement.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Francisco</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>$21K Seed in 2014</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Digital Media</span>, <span>News</span>, <span>Blogging Platforms</span>, <span>Writers</span></div><div><div></div><a href='http://twitter.com/fiskkit' rel='nofollow'>@fiskkit</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://fiskkit.com' rel='nofollow'>fiskkit.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/645/391645-448935d3377d1e925a3c4868e17c8b5d97850972.jpg?1409434617' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/647/391647-1e2834f49606b3cc6be857b62670a3939201a96a.jpg?1409434718' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/653/391653-4abd9dfabc6ac13a568b82e72b51dd09de011e30.png?1409439518' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/654/391654-3db0f14b8aa81d645cbb9119181aa85131aa4726.png?1409439529' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/658/391658-79c6f923d2c1e0cbb66632c67a0449fed8efaa64.jpg?1409441817' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/386434-fiskkit?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;Fiskkit&quot;

Whether it’s with customers, employees, or a target market, SurveyMonkey helps curious individuals and companies — including 99% of the Fortune 500 — have conversations at scale with the people who matter most. It’s People Powered Data that allows them to understand not only “what” is happening, but “why.” SurveyMonkey’s 700+ employees throughout North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are dedicated to powering the curious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</strong></span></p><p>SurveyMonkey is the world’s most popular survey platform. While it is a great general-purpose tool used by millions, there is ample opportunity for more specialized solutions. That’s where we come in. We build standalone, targeted SaaS products that bring great UX to solving more specific business problems.</p><p>To date, our 12-person team has shipped three products:</p><ul><li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a> - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a> - Understand and foster employee engagement</li><li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a> - Source and publish 3rd-party verified customer proof</li></ul><p>We’re on a mission to bring better design to the business world, and while we’re at it we’d like to make our mark with stunning data viz, personable interfaces, and a commitment to empathizing with our users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></span></p><p>We’re looking for a talented designer with demonstrable experience working on user-friendly SaaS applications. Your portfolio should demonstrate the ability to design for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop. You should also be comfortable writing clear, concise UI copy.</p><p>Strong visual design, product design, usability, and communication skills are essential. Technical skills such as CSS, Javascript, and familiarity with Ruby on Rails are also a strong plus, though not required.

As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific timezone by at least four hours, where you live and work and up to you. We’re not strangers though -- in addition to a sane amount of video calls, we meet up quarterly to get to know each other better and have some fun. In the past year, we've been bowling in Phoenix, made sushi in San Francisco, and toured a brewery.</p><p>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. As such, you will be expected to be a manager of one.</p><p>Naturally, we offer competitive salaries and annual bonuses, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and meaningful equity compensation.

Such a company already exists. Autodidactic I is a self-sustaining, autonomous company - where all revenue generation is automated by a fully autonomous AI and the humans can focus solely on creative endeavors. The company's vision is to create effectively a creators guild, an environment where pure, unrestrained creativity can thrive without the taint of profit motive or outside pressure - a concept they call the &quot;Autodidactic Islands.&quot;</div><div></div><div>The current team consists of primarily self-taught individuals each deeply skilled in multiple fields and disciplines. As such, we are constantly looking for others like ourselves who are equally inventors, creators, and artists at heart to join us in the vision behind the company. We believe the kind of projects we take on require the curiosity, hunger, and worldliness that only come from being genuinely interested in both programming and finance, math and literature, art and science, polymath and autodidact. This is a company built to do anything by people who do everything.</div><div><br></div><div></div><div>*Please do not apply if you only have interest and experience in one field.*At a minimal, you have a solid foothold in each the *financial*(algorithmic trading, blockchain, autonomous hedge funds, etc), *technical*(coding, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, etc), and *artistic*(film, music, games, etc). A typical day can go from trading cryptocurrencies and building AIs to acting an impromptu skit and composing soundtracks by ear. There is no room to dabble or tag along. We are not looking for &quot;masters of none.&quot; This is not an entry level position and not a specialized role. This is not an artist support group and not an accelerator or incubator to seed ideas. We are not here to save anyone, nor are we interested in anyone wanting to save the world. This is a team for those crazy and curious enough to build rockets to Mars or fuse with AI for immortality. This is a ship for those wanting to see how far they can go and not just how long they can survive. We've built an engine that lets us tackle any project we can think of, pursue any idea we can dream of, and we’re looking for others who can take it even further, others who, like us, have a strong sense of adventure, a healthy level of insanity, and a genuine desire to take over the world... just because we can! Bahaha!</div><div></div><div>Learn more about what we're up to at https://www.autodidactic.ai</div><div></div><div>As a way to filter many who will probably apply without reading what the role entails, please reach out to us directly at apply [ at ] autodidactic.ai rather than just hit the apply button. Note the team is spread across the world and frequently travels. Be prepared to be in a different city almost every other week (not a joke). There is no salary, but you will literally become part owner with control of the company.</div><div></div><div><br></div>  </div><div>    <h3>Apply for this position</h3>    <p>Join Us: <a href='mailto:apply@autodidactic.ai' rel='nofollow'>apply@autodidactic.ai</a></p>  </div>"

We currently do this by giving regulated businesses the tools they need to automate and digitalise the onboarding, verification and management of their customers - that means customers can be onboarded in real-time, without ever having met in person. <br /><br />And this is just the beginning - our technology allows us to define what ‘trust’ means across the digital economy. Our long term aim is to create a single network where people and businesses can share their digital identity securely and interchangeably - whether they’re applying for a mortgage, listing on the stock market, or applying for a new job. We're transforming how trust is established online, in the same way that Salesforce transformed sales, Stripe transformed payments and AWS transformed DevOps.<br /><br />What you’ll be doing<br /><br />You’ll work with our Lead Designer to help solve complex user-software problems. You’ll be a voice for our users and their needs. An internal champion for exceptional product quality and the need for cohesive experiences.<br /><br />On a day-to-day basis you’ll be involved in all parts of the design process. You’ll take part in user research, uncovering and documenting under served user needs. You’ll go wide in looking for solutions to user problems, generating multiple low-fidelity potential solutions. <br /><br />Using your inclusive, open and transparent approach to work, you’ll seek out feedback from users, designers, product managers and engineers throughout the design process, receiving in good faith and using new insights to inform the direction of your work.<br /><br />Your solutions will be simple and elegant and make use of the PassFort design system which you will help to maintain and extend when necessary.<br /> <br />We see this as a development role, and if you’re driven and motivated to learn and take on more responsibility, the opportunity will be here!<br /><br />What we’re looking for<br /><br />Strong interaction design skills: You’ll have an understanding of multi-step and cross-platform flows. Proficiency in sketching and wireframing simple features and user journeys, and an understanding for the need to design for different potential states (errors, successes, dead-ends).<br />Understanding of how user research fits into the design process: You’ll be aware of different methodologies and when to use them. <br />Understanding of visual design fundamentals: layout, visual hierarchy, colour, typography, and iconography.<br />Desire to continually learn, develop your skills and evolve as a designer and have the confidence and maturity to experiment with new research and design approaches as well as new methods and tooling.<br />Ability to be comfortable with, and embrace ambiguity.<br />Working knowledge of Sketch.<br />A portfolio showing your process and decision-making skills, as well as the final deliverables.<br /><br />The Perks!<br />Equity! We want you to succeed as we do<br />Great location - we’re central to three stations, and sandwiched between Brick Lane and Spitalfields market<br />An annual learning & development budget to spend on professional or personal development, we’re invested in both<br />Birthday off - relax and put your feet up<br />Dental cover<br />Access to Perkbox - discounts to services and products (and honestly it’s fantastic)<br />Equally Enhanced Maternity/Paternity/Shared Leave pay <br />Generous holiday entitlement<br />Pension contributions - investing in your future is important<br />Pick your own equipment and kit<br />Biscuits… we’re a bit obsessed. We have a weekly ‘guest’ biscuit to broaden your biscuit horizons.<br /><br />If you're interested in applying, please also submit either a link (or file) to your portfolio"

    "content": "<h2> Humbly Confident Visual Designer</h2><div>Worldwide</div><div>Company: You Need A Budget<p></p></div><div>FULL-TIME</div><div><h3>Overview</h3><p>YNAB makes friendly, high quality software that changes lives through effective budgeting. We’ve got an ecosystem of apps, live classes, and stellar support. Now we need our next visual designer to bring the same attention to detail to our branding, marketing, and educational materials.</p><p>You come to the table with some experience under your belt. You know how to expand and maintain meticulous brand guidelines. You catch color mismatches that are mere shades off, you bristle at poor kerning, and you know that good design is in the details. You love to draw, and can create masterpieces with the pen tool. You also love to dream and get that our dream is to build a brand that is fun, smart, and approachable.</p><h2><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</strong></h2><ul><li>At least two years of experience working in marketing design.</li><li>Experience working within strict, existing brand guidelines.</li><li>Experience creating vector illustrations.</li><li>Experience doing time-sensitive production work.</li><li>Experience designing for responsive web.</li><li>Ability to work and communicate effectively in a remote environment.</li><li>Your home base must be located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</li></ul><h2><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></h2><p>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: ourhas to really&nbsp;<em>click</em>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</p><p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><h2><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></h2><p><strong>Todd,&nbsp;</strong>our Chief Strategy Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and experiences our users have in them—and knows that process begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;</strong>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</p><p><strong>Lindsey</strong>, our Chief Marketing Officer, is in charge of getting the word out about YNAB, and always finds a fun way to do that. Like our&nbsp;, where-in she wrote and re-recorded budgeting-related lyrics to pop-songs. (We suggest reading the rest of this description while listening to that album.)</p><p><strong>Lauren&nbsp;</strong>is our illustrator/designer. She is single-handedly responsible for almost all of the illustrations you see on our blog/Facebook/Instagram posts, and might be single-handedly responsible for all of the WoW achievement points mentioned on our&nbsp;. We should also mention that she designed and illustrated that page. So yeah, her list of awesome just keeps going and going. Oh, and she writes fantasy novels. Seriously.</p><h2><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></h2><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><h4><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></h4><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work pretty much wherever you want (for this particular opening, there are some time-zone requirements). Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><h4><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></h4><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><h4><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></h4><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Something closer to five is about right. Plus we take two extra weeks for a Holiday break. It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><h4><strong>The YNAB Meetup</strong></h4><p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done, a&nbsp;&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</p><h4><strong>Up Your Game</strong></h4><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). We have a monthly book budget, send people to conferences, give dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.</p><h4><strong>International is Absolutely Okay</strong></h4><p>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. We are spread all over the world,&nbsp;but for this particular position, we have a strong preference for candidates located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</p><h4><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></h4><p>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;<em>and your family.</em>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;<em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Why then, did you muddle through all of that awesomeness?)</p><h2><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></h2><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;<em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you.&nbsp;You will play a big, big part in helping the YNAB brand come to life and reach wider audiences.&nbsp;I’ll only say that six more times.</p><h2><strong>Now, back to you, our new Visual Designer…</strong></h2><p>As a visual designer at YNAB, you’ll live on&nbsp;<em>two&nbsp;</em>teams. You’ll be a prized resource for our marketing team, churning out ads, landing pages, and illustrations while maintaining the YNAB brand. As a member of the design team you’ll work alongside both UI/UX designers and visual designers to consistently improve the quality of visual design across the YNAB ecosystem. You will be our boots on the ground, protecting our brand with your pixel-perfect attention to detail.</p><h3><strong>What Success Looks Like:</strong></h3><p>The marketing team marvels at your ability to think big and execute quickly on the smallest of tasks. You roll up your sleeves and deliver what’s needed, sometimes before the marketing team asks for it. Other designers can’t stop praising you for your museum-worthy artwork and strict approach to file management. You’ll probably make our CEO cry from time to time. Our campaigns are so beautiful he can barely look at them without bringing out a tissue. You also make us laugh. We like to laugh.</p><p>You take direction from multiple teams, and communicate freely. You understand that great communication and time management is critical to your success in a remote work environment. When you say it will be done, it will be done. Your teammates don’t even have to think about it.</p><p>You know a great designer loves the very smallest parts of the job. Some call it pixel pushing. Others call it production work. We call it craft. You love tweaking your designs in the browser and communicate easily with developers, including in HTML and CSS. Because that’s how it’s done.</p><p>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem-solving for both creative and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to (devour, really) ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our company: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.</p><h3><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></h3><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li><li>You have experience with animation and/or know how to prepare artwork for rigging.</li></ul><h2><strong>How to Apply</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Apply below by 11:59pm on August 19th, 2018.&nbsp;</strong>It’s a firm deadline.</li><li>Attach a PDF of your cover letter.

We’ve got an ecosystem of apps, live classes, and stellar support. Now we need our next visual designer to bring the same attention to detail to our branding, marketing, and educational materials. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>You come to the table with some experience under your belt. You know how to expand and maintain meticulous brand guidelines. You catch color mismatches that are mere shades off, you bristle at poor kerning, and you know that good design is in the details. You love to draw, and can create masterpieces with the pen tool. You also love to dream and get that our dream is to build a brand that is fun, smart, and approachable. </span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span> Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</span></p><ul><li><span>At least two years of experience working in marketing design.</span></li><li><span>Experience working within strict, existing brand guidelines. </span></li><li><span>Experience creating vector illustrations.</span></li><li><span>Experience doing time-sensitive production work. </span></li><li><span>Experience designing for responsive web. </span></li><li><span>Ability to work and communicate effectively in a remote environment.</span></li><li><span>Your home base must be located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span>A Bit About Us</span></h2><p><span>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a><span>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></p><p><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span></p><p><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> <span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span> has to really </span><span>click</span><span> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you! </span></p><p><span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span></p><p><span>Who you’d be working with:</span></p><p><span>Todd, </span><span>our Chief Strategy Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and experiences our users have in them—and knows that process begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence </span><span>and </span><span>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</span></p><p><span>Lindsey</span><span>, our Chief Marketing Officer, is in charge of getting the word out about YNAB, and always finds a fun way to do that. Like our </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/ynab-mixtape-2017/' rel='nofollow'><span>YNAB mix-tape</span></a><span>, where-in she wrote and re-recorded budgeting-related lyrics to pop-songs. (We suggest reading the rest of this description while listening to that album.)</span></p><p><span>Lauren </span><span>is our illustrator/designer. She is single-handedly responsible for almost all of the illustrations you see on our blog/Facebook/Instagram posts, _and_ might be single-handedly responsible for all of the WoW achievement points mentioned on our </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/about/' rel='nofollow'><span>About Page</span></a><span>. We should also mention that she designed and illustrated that page. So yeah, her list of awesome just keeps going and going. Oh, and she writes fantasy novels. Seriously.</span></p><h3><span>How You’ll Work at YNAB</span></h3><p><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></p><p><span>Live Where You Want</span></p><p><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work pretty much wherever you want (for this particular opening, there are some time-zone requirements). Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection. </span></p><p><span>No Crazy Hours</span></p><p><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></p><p><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></p><p><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span><span>minimum</span><span> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Something closer to five is about right. Plus we take two extra weeks for a Holiday break. It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span></p><p><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></p><p><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a><span>, a </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a><span> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch on Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></p><p><span>Up Your Game</span></p><p><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). We have a monthly book budget, send people to conferences, give dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></p><p><span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. We are spread all over the world</span><span>, </span><span>but for this particular position, we have a strong preference for candidates located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</span><strong></strong></p><p><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></p><p><span>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span><span>and your family.</span><span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span><span>your retirement</span> <span>nest egg</span><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Why then, did you muddle through all of that awesomeness?)</span></p><p><span>Other Tidbits</span></p><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span></li><li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><span>standing</span><span>?) in front of a computer.</span></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not </span><span>think</span><span> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span></li></ul><p><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. </span><span>You will play a big, big part in helping the YNAB brand come to life and reach wider audiences.</span><span> I’ll only say that six more times.</span></p><h2><span>Now, back to you, our new Visual Designer...</span></h2><p><span>As a visual designer at YNAB, you’ll live on </span><span>two </span><span>teams.
