Despite being new to the market, Instilled is built on a mature product with a solid client base and consolidates a wealth of experience and technology from our parent group. We are a small, agile team in a much larger learning technology business that is successful and passionate about creating outstanding learning tools.</p><p>What Instilled provides is a YouTube like experience for learners to discover content and progress at their own pace—it was originally a video platform, so included are a host of video features such as auto-captioning, auto-translation and commenting etc.</p><p>We are still in the early stages of this products transformation but we have huge aspirations and want developers that relish the opportunity to create industry-leading products.</p><p><strong>How will I know this is for me?</strong></p><p>First, this is a UK-specific role.&nbsp;<strong>Candidates must be eligible to work in the UK.</strong>&nbsp;Our team does have a US component, but we are not currently hiring for&nbsp;any US roles.</p><p>Our ideal candidate is friendly, enthusiastic and just as passionate about technology as we are. The team spans multiple offices and time-zones so a self-starter attitude and excellent communication skills are key. We know not everyone has experience of the learning industry but that’s fine, we want people that understand code. Our current tech stack is comprised of Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, AngularJS, and others. These things change though, so whilst prior experience is advantageous, the key is being able to adapt to whatever technology the task demands. We look for developers that have an opinion about how technology can be applied, but remain equally open minded about new or different approaches. Working well in a team is vital as this role will be fundamental in shaping our product architecture - clearly articulating a concept and nurturing other team members is hugely important.</p><p><strong>Ok, sounds great! What do I do?</strong></p><p>This is a unique opportunity to join a dynamic product team that is taking an impressive client list in to a whole new world of learning.

You&rsquo;ll be the lead designer on our exciting new brand and so will have a great deal of autonomy with your creative executions.</p><br /><p class=&quot;&quot;>Whilst the role is predominantly based in London, we offer great flexibility with working hours and where you work from. All we ask is that you maintain an open communication and ensure you deliver on the work set out for you.</p><br /><p class=&quot;&quot;>The ideal candidate will have at least 3 years experience working across all areas of design (print and digital) and will feel confident figuring out how to work with new design formats as and when they arise. They will have a strong portfolio of work and feel comfortable, on occasion, taking the initiative if required. &nbsp;</p><br /><p class=&quot;&quot;>We&rsquo;re currently in the early stages of our expansion, which means your role will expand as the company does. Above all, our team are a wonderful, friendly bunch who are all passionate about innovating in the ethical food space, so it would be a big bonus if you were passionate in that area too!</p><br /><p class=&quot;&quot;>If you&rsquo;re interested in applying, please send over your portfolio, CV, and a quick cover letter to tell us a bit more about yourself. We can&rsquo;t wait to hear from you!</p><br /><p class=&quot;&quot;><strong>A bit more about us:</strong><br /><br />At Better Nature, our mission is to make our food system more people-, planet- and animal-friendly. And we think we&rsquo;ve found the perfect way to do so - through the power of tempeh! Tempeh (pronounced tem-pay) fermentation takes any legume, nut, grain or seed (it&rsquo;s typically made using soybeans) and transforms them into an even better food source. It binds them into a meaty block that&rsquo;s high in protein and fibre and is great for the gut.</p><br /><p>And it doesn&rsquo;t stop there - our talented team is working with tempeh to make it even more nutritious, delicious, as well as turning it into lots of new and exciting high-protein products.

We believe that our best path towards our billion-dollar goal is to build a world-class team of strategic creatives in-house who GET our mission and can execute at the pace and quality we need to hit our goal.</p><p>That will allow us to cycle ideas, designs and creatives faster, more efficiently and with better results. You’ll be right in the center of the action, working directly with the company co-founders and the Heads of our Content, e-Commerce and Funnel teams to knock out one exciting project after another.</p><p>You will hit the ground running without being slowed down due to lack of resources as we’ve carefully curated a passionate, problem-solving team that can help you sprint from day 1.</p><p>We&nbsp;<em>deeply</em>&nbsp;appreciate the talent needed to craft designs &amp; ads that convert. We&nbsp;<em>deeply</em>&nbsp;appreciate the unique skillset needed to properly strategize and execute on world-class website, ad creative, funnel and print design. And we&nbsp;<em>deeply</em>&nbsp;appreciate the discipline needed to get it all done on time.</p><p>You’ll be constantly challenged with exciting opportunities that will make you stretch and grow.</p><p><strong>Who is This Opportunity Perfect for?</strong></p><p>Anybody who is ready for their next growth opportunity who might relate to any of these:</p><p>If you’re tired of the commute, sick of burning the midnight oil, stress is dominating your life, and the cost of real estate is eating up your retirement, this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction.</p><p>Or, if you’re drowning in agency work, frenetically jumping from one account to the next, putting out fires, and getting eaten up with too much on your plate, this is your opportunity to simplify, focus and go deep – to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity… and scale it like never before.</p><p>Or, if you’ve always wanted to be a part of the thrill of a rapidly growing company, but didn’t want to move to an expensive big city with all the madness, stress and high cost that brings, this is your opportunity to stay where you are (or move to where you always wanted to go) to design your ideal life.</p><p>Or, if you’re buried in a big, slow-moving company that doesn’t appreciate the value that a true high-performing, creative art director can bring, that doesn’t understand why the artistic details can actually make a&nbsp;<em>huge</em>&nbsp;difference in campaign performance…. or that thinks “anybody can do this”, this is your opportunity to step into the spotlight, to completely own something that has the full support of the entire organization from top to bottom.</p><p>Regardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day… AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please KEEP reading as we can’t wait to meet you.</p><p><strong>Who Are We and What’s the Company’s Background?</strong></p><p>Our mission is to spread our&nbsp;<em>metabolism-first</em>&nbsp;way of living we’ve been busy perfecting for 8 years to a worldwide audience. It’s a lifestyle that’s 100% focused on getting you the results that matter:&nbsp;<em>looking</em>&nbsp;your best,&nbsp;<em>feeling</em>&nbsp;your best and&nbsp;<em>doing</em>&nbsp;your best. In the shortest time possible. And in a way that&nbsp;<em>sticks</em>.</p><p>That’s why our tag line is “Life’s Short. Make it Count.” It puts you back in control. It empowers you to fix your own problems. And it makes you want to tell the world about it.</p><p>Our vision is to do this by becoming a billion-dollar multi-channel brand that’s distributed via online, mobile and physical retail. We’ve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework and high-performance culture to make this happen. And now we’re scaling into a much larger stage.</p><p>We’ve built a full ecosystem of products and services that allow someone to live a metabolism-first lifestyle. This includes exercise and nutrition programs, nutraceuticals, functional foods and membership programs. We’re launching a mobile app next year, then will push into offline retail, extend into home-delivered meals and more. But ONE thing at a time, just like we’ve done for 8 years.</p><p>Our next major step is rolling out our new&nbsp;<em>Metabolic Living</em>&nbsp;brand and centralized e-commerce website at&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metabolicliving.com%2F' rel='nofollow'>www.metabolicliving.com</a>, scheduled to be live by November. As part of this, we will consolidate our various product-driven microsites where we drive our media buys like at&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metabolicrenewal.com%2F' rel='nofollow'>www.metabolicrenewal.com</a>.</p><p><strong>So why is a metabolism-first lifestyle needed?</strong>&nbsp;Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up in virtually every country. Why is that? Because we’re over-worked, over-stressed, over-fed and toxic. And we’re deprived of the sleep, nutrition, exercise, movement and relaxation we need to thrive. That’s a recipe for disaster. And we’re seeing it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise trap people into a 1-step-forward-2-steps back vicious cycle that actually makes them&nbsp;<em>worse</em>&nbsp;off. They bounce around from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making any progress… staying trapped in a downward spiral.</p><p>Rigid philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create an us-vs-them tribal mentality that’s self-limiting. Neither of those philosophies work for&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;people&nbsp;<em>all</em>&nbsp;the time… or even the same person all the time. People differ. People change. If that’s not respected, things will backfire.</p><p>We, on the other hand, present a&nbsp;<em>framework</em>&nbsp;that allows you to customize your life in a way that works best for you, so you can reach your fullest metabolic potential. Because we’ve found through working with millions of people that a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results you want.</p><p>Instead of fighting&nbsp;<em>against</em>&nbsp;your body or your life, we teach you to work&nbsp;<em>with</em>&nbsp;your body and life to create the perfect program for you. One that’s practical. One that’s sustainable. One that’s enjoyable. And, most importantly, one that delivers the results you want at any stage of life. And fast.</p><p>And we practice what we preach: our company is designed so&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;on our team both enjoys their work challenges while having plenty of time to do what they most in their life. We recruit only high-performing, humble people who produce in fast cycles, hold themselves accountable and have fun.

If you’re passionate about the craft and process of building an exciting product from the ground up and working with great people, you’ll fit right in.\n<br>\n<br>Who are we?\n<br>\n<br>CreditDigital allows vendors to provide an instant finance option to their business customers at online checkout or point-of-sale. Business customers can then design their own terms to fit their budget and cashflow. We are trying to solve a massive problem in the B2B world and we are very excited to be amongst the first ones tackling it.\n<br>\n<br>What will you be doing?\n<br>\n<br>As the first designer in the company, you will have the opportunity to set up the standards in how the design process works. As a product team, we trust each individual to be autonomous and work towards are shared goals. We are fully committed in supporting one another in any way possible.\n<br>\n<br>Act as a champion that drives product ideas from start to completion: from research insights, to workflows all the way to visual designs.\n<br>\n<br>Sketch and prototype ideas to quickly access viability, and design the fine grained details of interactions.\n<br>Iterate based on feedback from the whole team.\n<br>Work closely with engineers as they build and ship ideas.\n<br>\n<br>What skills and experience do I need?\n<br>\n<br>We are looking for product designers that have done this before. You will be designer #1 which is very exciting and you will get to set the tone of our product.\n<br>\n<br>Experience designing digital products and systems (styleguides), not just websites. You have helped ship products.\n<br>An appreciation of the entire product development process, from problem solving through to detailed UI and visual design.\n<br>\n<br>The ability to create mockups of your designs.\n<br>Excellent communicator that can articulate the thought behind proposals.\n<br>Able to collaborate with the engineers and the wider company on strategy and delivery.\n<br>Where will I be working from?\n<br>\n<br>Normally you will be working from our Angel offices (right next to the station) but we are a remote friendly bunch so you can adjust your schedule as you see fit.\n<br>\n<br>What would I be paid?\n<br>\n<br>Our pay is within the top 10% of the industry, for the matched role and experience, based on London rates. According to the market at the moment, we aim to pay £70,000 for the role.\n<br>\n<br>Salary is not everything. Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived away from work. We don't offer free beers or Coke on tap but rather:\n<br>\n<br>25 days off per annum plus bank holidays.\n<br>35 hours / week. Normal working hours are between 10am – 6pm.\n<br>Work from home whenever. If you prefer to come to the office everyday that’s great, if you prefer to work from home 4 times a week that’s fantastic. Whatever works for you. As a team we will make sure you are not missing out by pushing remote first practices. Flexibility to adjust your daily hours. Visiting friends and family in another country, going to the bank or the gym, you only need to have an overlap between our core hours (12am – 4pm) for 6 hours. As an example, you can start at 8am and finish at 4pm or 12am and finish at 8pm.\n<br>\n<br>How to apply?\n<br>\n<br>Where you have previously worked does not really matter. If you have a Linkedin profile, just to have a more general idea, send it through, no CV is needed in that case. Instead, send us through a cover letter where you explain more about your experience. We would like you to express:\n<br>\n<br>What have you worked on that you are the most proud of?\n<br>What do you enjoy working on the most?\n<br>How do you approach the design process?\n<br>What would you like to work on here?\n<br>\n<br>In the interview process we will go through a particular piece of work (your choice) that you have delivered, detailing the approach around it, challenges and learnings. We're looking for a feature/research that clearly outlines the problems you were tackling with your design work. It should touch on the process you applied to tackling the challenges, rather than focusing just on visuals and landing pages. We would like to go through from inception to interactions and the visual design. The work should ideally focus on designing software products.\n<br>\n<br>We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company.\n<br>\n<br>",

You can see some of them here.</p>\n <p><strong>We’re looking to bring on world-class cover designers for freelance work. We’ll start initially on a per-project basis so we can BOTH decide whether if we’re a good fit for each other, and there may be the potential to join in the future as a full-time Tribe member.</strong></p>\n <p>We’re looking for someone with book cover design experience. Must-have qualifications are technical proficiency with InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator, as well as experience producing print products.</p>\n <p>Most of all, we’re on the hunt for an original thinker who can both dream big and work intelligently in order to make great concepts a reality for our Authors.</p>\n <p>If you can nail all the above, you’re probably pretty awesome, which brings us to an important question:</p>\n <p><strong>Who are we and what do we do?</strong></p>\n <p>We’re <strong>Scribe Media</strong>, and our mission is to help everyone on earth write, publish and market their book. The problem is that writing and publishing books are, for most people, a painful and difficult process, loaded with uncertainty and aggravation. Our goal is to make it as simple as possible, so that as many people as possible can do it. We have multiple ways we help people do this. We can edit and publish an already written manuscript (Scribe Publishing), or we can help people write their book using a structured process with our guidance (Scribe Guided Author), or we can do a structured interview process that gets the book out of them in their words and their voice (Scribe Professional). And if you can’t afford our services, that’s fine. We give away all of our information for free. Seriously, it’s called Scribe Book School, and it’s better than any paid course on the internet.</p>\n <p><strong>Why our work matters</strong></p>\n <p>Our company was started because a frustrated entrepreneur wanted to put all of her incredible knowledge and ideas into a book, but didn’t have the time to write it or the patience to deal with the frustrating publishing process. So we solved her problem. Her book became an amazing success, and we realized the world was full of these people–<em>smart people who should write a book, but don’t, because the process is so painful. </em>These people want to write books, but don’t have the time or desire to do it the old way, and that’s why Scribe exists: <em>we help people turn their ideas into books that both cement their legacy and impact the world. </em>Our process has worked for over 1200 authors in five years, and we’re growing fast. Our ultimate goal is to <em>help everyone on earth write and publish a book. </em>If we do that, we’ll help create many thousands of books that would never have otherwise existed, changing the lives of millions of people. That’s really exciting to us.</p>\n <p><strong>You In? Awesome, here’s the details:</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Location</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Anywhere in the world. If we decide later to work together full-time, you must be based in or willing to relocate to Austin, Texas.</strong></li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Type of Employment</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>Freelance first, potentially moving to full-time.</strong></li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Necessary Skills &amp; Qualifications:</strong></p>\n <p>Here is the list of skills we believe are necessary for this job. Most importantly, we are hiring based on careful balance of relevant experience, cultural fit, and motivation:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><u>Extensive Design Skills:</u> We are more concerned about your design skills than your resume. If your portfolio is good, we’re willing to give you a try, regardless of experience or credentials.</li>\n  <li><u>You Are Organized &amp; Task Oriented:</u> This is not a job for something who is sloppy with details. You will be juggling multiple design projects at once, and you’ll have to be able to get things done and keep up with your projects.</li>\n  <li><u>You Are Self-Motivated And Get Shit Done:</u> We don’t want someone who has to be constantly managed. If you only work well with someone telling you what to do, DO NOT APPLY. You must be very self-motivated. There are no lifestyle roles here. We all work very hard every day, because we care about our mission, and what we do matters to us and other people. Authors rely on you. [NOTE: Hard work does not mean endless hours. It only means results. There is no coasting and no hiding here and you will be held accountable for achieving real results. If that doesn’t excite you, this is the wrong tribe for you.]</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Pay &amp; Perks:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><u>Competitive Pay:</u> $1500 per cover freelance (for paperback + ebook covers; bonus pay for hardcover and/or audiobook versions)</li>\n  <li><u>Be Connected To A Tribe:</u> You (should) have seen the videos above. We also have a pretty cool set of principles that we live by as a Tribe, you should check it out, because this is the operating system for our tribe, and everyone in our company lives the values and principles outlined in this doc. We interact with our freelancers in the same way.</li>\n  <li><u>Make A Real Impact:</u> We’re a small tribe (still under 50 full time), and you will be a major part of the projects you work on. Not only that, you won’t just impact the company, you’ll impact the world. Books are one of the very best ways to influence other people and change the way they think–and you’ll be helping to make them a reality.</li>\n  <li><u>Work With Interesting People:</u> You’re not just working on any books. Past authors include major company CEOs, famous entrepreneurs, professional athletes, and people with amazing personal stories. These are books that change lives.</li>\n </ul> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://scribe.breezy.hr/p/fa4de878b227-book-cover-designer' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

International applicants welcome.</em></strong></p>\n <p>Alright, here’s the deal. We’re looking to hire someone to primarily do two things: <strong>(1)</strong> Design totally badass stuff and <strong>(2)</strong> help to build it.</p>\n <p>Often, the aforementioned badass stuff will be in the form of WordPress-based websites. So, it’s critical that you’re familiar with WordPress and feel pretty comfortable bending it to your will. Experience using popular page builders, like Beaver Builder, Visual Composer and Divi, is a big plus. Beaver Builder especially.</p>\n <p>You don’t need to be a hardcore developer to do this job (we’ve got some of those on staff, we intravenously pump them full of caffeine and try to avoid making direct eye contact). However, for you, a working knowledge of HTML and CSS will be fairly important.</p>\n <p>Right about now feels like a good time to make a list.</p>\n <p><strong>In this job, you will:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Design websites, layouts, app interfaces and more. They will look terrific.</li>\n  <li>Help to build/code/assemble these things.</li>\n  <li>Use WordPress, a lot.</li>\n  <li>Collaborate closely with your team members, including other designers, developers and project managers.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>And you’ll need:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Killer design skills.</li>\n  <li>A fundamental understanding of UX/UI principles</li>\n  <li>Strong ability with Adobe software, particularly Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. Also, we use Figma a lot.</li>\n  <li>Functional knowledge of HTML and CSS.</li>\n  <li>Experience with WordPress page builders, particularly Beaver Builder.</li>\n  <li>An enchanted fedora that allows the wearer to see into the future.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>We know what you’re thinking. <em>“Hey, this sounds exactly like the type of stuff I love to do! In fact, I love it so much, I’d do it for free!” </em>Well, guess what: If you work here, you won’t have to.</p>\n <p>That’s right, <strong>we pay our employees.</strong></p>\n <p>Your mind = blown.</p>\n <p>In exchange for your services, you’ll be rewarded with a flexible work schedule, competitive pay, unlimited leave, as well as participation in our annual shutdown (often two weeks off, sometimes more, at the end of the year). Plus, we celebrate most federal holidays by not working.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://www.yokoco.com/careers/job-listing-web-designer/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",
