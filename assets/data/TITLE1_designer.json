Every day we wake up to dozens of ecstatic messages and stories of impromptu getaways, surprise adventures and the ability to visit destinations that were prohibitively expensive.</p><p><strong>Profitable from day one. 100% bootstrapped.</strong></p><p>Our business model is simple and transparent: we offer free and premium subscriptions. Premium subscribers pay $39/year and get 100% of deals (free subscribers get ~ 1 in 3 deals), no ads in emails, and first dibs on emails. We don't get referral fees for any bookings, and our North Star is finding the best deals.</p><p>We're currently doing over $5,000,000 annual run rate. We've never taken venture capital, and instead focus on delivering as much value to subscribers as we can every day.</p><p><strong>Do the best work of your life.</strong></p><p>If your dream job is to be one of the founding members of an engineering team at a high-growth, remote company with product-market fit, we'd love to connect.</p><p>You'll work on a small (but growing!) team of developers that operate with limitless ownership, autonomy and room for growth. We value prior leadership experience, though by no means require anybody to be on a path toward management.</p><p><strong>We're a 100% remote team and wouldn't have it any other way.</strong></p><p>Unlike some remote roles, we don't have any offices, so you'll never be left out of the loop while a group of people in 'HQ' have an impromptu huddle in a conference room and make decisions while you're not there.</p><p>We rely heavily on Slack, Zoom, Google Team Drive, Geekbot asynchronous daily standups, JIRA and a few other cool tools to stay connected and in alignment.</p><p><strong>The interview process.</strong></p><p>We're a small team and move quickly. Step one is a brief&nbsp;chat with our recruiter, then a short (1-hour) design exercise, a call with our Product lead, a call with our engineers and final round chat with our co-founders, Scott and Brian. From there we'll discuss next steps, ask for a few references and get an offer out. Total time? Two weeks or less if we can align schedules.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>No commute!

We make high quality products for WordPress developers.</div><div><br></div><div>The “we” is currently&nbsp;<a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>6 full-time developers</a>, two full-time marketers, and myself. I have some design experience myself and have managed to get by ok designing our products on my own over the past 5 years. But now I need to focus more on the big picture. Plus, having a great product designer onboard will have a major positive impact on the business.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a design-lead company. We do wireframing internally (the developers and I collaborate on them) and we outsource the later design phases to freelance designers. It’s been working OK, but I know the results would be mind-blowingly better if we had a great product designer involved from the earlier stages.</div><div><br></div><div>I’m looking for a great product designer who can work with us 15-20 hours per week every week and is excited about the idea of growing with us and possibly going full-time in 2019.</div><div><br></div><div>I personally review all applications myself.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>ABOUT YOU</h4></div><div>Not only are you a great product designer, you’re a designer in a broad sense. You admire and appreciate well-designed things, whether it be a building, a bridge, a car, or a laptop stand. You die a little inside when you have to buy something that is poorly designed. You follow, admire, and engage with other talented designers.</div><div><br></div><div>You have extensive experience designing web apps. You’ve engaged with customers and analyzed data to determine if your designs are effective. You’ve collaborated with a team of developers and are confident participating in technical discussions.</div><div><br></div><div>“When your favorite tool is a hammer, then all you see is nails.”</div><div><br></div><div>That saying does&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;describe you. Although you’re a talented visual designer, you’re acutely aware that “more paint” is not always the solution. You apply visual design very carefully and intentionally. You prioritize simplicity and user experience over visual design and strive for just the right balance.</div><div><br></div><div>You’re curious and love to learn. You look forward to meetings with developers and are energized by technical conversations.</div><div><br></div><div>Although you often need people to help you generate ideas and formulate a plan of attack on a project, you do your best work in isolation without interruption. You’re proactive in tackling things that need to be done without direction.</div><div><br></div><div>You embrace the opportunity to level up, learn something new and really dig into it. You’re a disciplined worker and have no trouble getting work done at home on any given day.</div><div><br></div><div>You’re an excellent communicator no matter the medium, whether it be instant message, email, phone, or video chat. You understand that excellent communication is part of what makes a team work better together. Sharing a design deliverable without explaining its context or what you need from the team is unheard of in your world.</div><div><br></div><div>You own both your successes and your failures. You practice Extreme Ownership. When a project you’re leading turns into a disaster, you own it and you learn from it. You never point the finger at others.</div><div><br></div><div>You welcome criticism and genuinely want to grow as a professional. We’re big on&nbsp;<a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/team-pushes-better-developers/' rel='nofollow'>pushing each other to be better</a>. That’s how we grow as individuals and a team. It’s one thing to accept criticism and another to ask for it and use it to level up.</div><div><br></div><div>You enjoy moving quickly on projects. We’re a small team with big ambitions which means we have a lot that we want to do. We need our new ideas to move to execution quickly so we can determine whether to invest more time in them or change course. You thrive in an environment where things move swiftly and dread being the person who slows down the team. That being said, you never let the speed of execution impact the quality of your work.</div><div><br></div><div><h4>RESPONSIBILITIES</h4></div><div>Although your primary role will be to design our products, as the only designer in the company you will work on all-things design. At first we will work closely, but once we establish trust you will operate with complete autonomy and make high level design decisions on your own, reporting to me on a weekly basis. Your responsibilities will include:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Collaborate with product teams to design new UIs and enhance existing ones</li><li>Engage with our customers to verify design effectiveness</li><li>Work with the marketing team on new designs for our web site, ad campaigns, and print materials</li><li>Collaborate with the marketing team on A/B testing designs, analyzing usage and behavioural data, and iterating on designs</li><li>Design new t-shirts and other swag to send to our customers</li><li>Hire a freelancer or agency to produce illustrations, branding, or other areas of design that is not your greatest strength and manage those projects</li></ul><div><h4>REQUIREMENTS</h4></div><ul><li>Your work hours must overlap with mine (somewhere within 8am – 4pm Atlantic Time) in the beginning, then we can relax this requirement</li><li>Extensive experience designing for the web, including responsive</li><li>Made significant contributions to the design of at least one SaaS or mobile app</li><li>Lead the UX for at least one project</li><li>Experience validating UIs with customers</li><li>Collaborated with developers on projects</li><li>Comfortable and confident in technical discussions</li></ul><div><h4>NICE-TO-HAVE</h4></div><ul><li>Front-end development skills</li><li>Experience working remotely</li><li>Bachelor’s degree or equivalent</li></ul><div><h4>BENEFITS</h4></div><div>Because this is a part-time position, you are not eligible for standard benefits</div><div><br></div><div>However, a couple of big benefits that you will share with the rest of the team is the freedom to work from anywhere in the world and the flexibility to choose your schedule. Plus there’s a very good chance this will become a full-time position in 2019, which means you could be eligible for things like health insurance, parental leave, equipment stipend or attending&nbsp;<a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/tag/company-retreat/' rel='nofollow'>company retreats</a>. We have a “choose your own adventure” approach to benefits with full-time employees that you’ll be able to pick from should you go full-time.</div><div><br></div><div><h5>Location Independent</h5></div><div>You’ll be free to work from nearly anywhere in the world, wherever you’re happiest. Our team is currently distributed across the globe, working from our homes in Nova Scotia, Ontario, Pennsylvania, Scotland, and England. As long as you continue to overlap with Atlantic hours, your specific location doesn’t matter to us. </div><div><br></div><div><h5>You Choose Your Schedule</h5></div><div>You’ll also have the flexibility to sleep in every day or get up at the crack of dawn. Work a couple hours in the morning and a couple in the evening. It really doesn’t matter as long as we overlap by four hours most days in the beginning and after a while it will be completely up to you.</div><div><br></div><div><h5>Grow Your Career</h5></div><div>We are launching two new products this year: a third WordPress plugin called WP Offload SES and a new SaaS app called SpinupWP. The plan for the future is to build more products and grow the business that way. As the first designer in a growing company, you can imagine the career growth opportunities ahead!</div><div><br></div><div>I look forward to personally reviewing your application.</div><div><br></div><div>Best of luck,</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div></div><div><span>Brad Touesnard<br></span></div><div><span>Founder &amp; CEO<br></span></div><div><span>Delicious Brains Inc</span></div><div><br></div><div><h3>ABOUT OUR COMPANY</h3></div><div>We’re Delicious Brains Inc. We make awesome stuff for WordPress developers including:</div><div><br></div><div>WP Migrate DB Pro – our flagship product that lets you copy your database from one WordPress install to another with one click in your dashboard. Yep, it’s that easy. If you find yourself needing to migrate databases, our customers call this one a “no-brainer.”</div><div><br></div><div>WP Offload S3 – our plugin that lets you serve your media and assets from S3, CloudFront or your personal favorite CDN. Cue site speed benefits.</div><div><br></div><div>We’re also working on a new WordPress plugin and a new SaaS app, both launching later this year.</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. Wondering about the name Delicious Brains? Funny story. It’s a Simpsons reference. Pretty obscure, but Homer utters it in a zombie episode. Have you seen it? And yes, we’ve spent a lot of time debating Z-Day strategies on company retreats. </div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Fill out the answers to this survey: <a href='https://deliciousbrains.com/product-designer-apply' rel='nofollow'>https://deliciousbrains.com/product-designer-apply</a></p>  </div>",

If that's you and you have a portfolio to back that up, feel free to quote your hourly or project rate upfront.</p><p>Core Data currently needs an additional HTML5 web designer with react and redux experience to create a major expansion on the company's HTML5-based UI. The existing UI can be seen at this <a href='http://coredata.eu/newui' rel='nofollow'>link</a>. The existing UI is focused on displaying available offers for live (actively in play) sports games and uses a simplified navigation scheme where the user simply selects a sport, then a game, and ultimately selects what wagers are wanted.</p><p>The candidate will need to expand this User Interface to include &quot;prematch&quot; betting. Mockup designs for this have already been prepared <a href='https://coredata.eu/designer.html' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. The enhancement will keep all existing functionality of the live UI, but add a tab/screen for upcoming games that have not yet started. The list of available prematch games is numerous (sometimes in the thousands) and so the navigation scheme will be much more sophisticated than the live (current) navigation scheme. The company's goal is to have a clean, smooth, and intuitive cross-browser product.</p><p>The candidate will be expected to combine their knowledge of aesthetics and intuitive UX principles to create a cutting-edge, crisp, and attractive prematch expansion to the company's UI. The existing UI uses React.JS and Redux, so prior experience with these frameworks is necessary. The backend data to power the UI is provided vi a WebSockets feed and our backend team can make reasonable changes to the feed format if it is necessary to facilitate a speedy project completion.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/193809?reset=False&amp;ra=12ZQuM6F5hBu&amp;oqs=a%3D12ZQuM6F5hBu' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Core Data</h3>            <div><p>First and foremost, we are a software development company owned and operated entirely by professionals with a strong technical background. &nbsp;Since technology is our core focus and software is our principal product, all projects at&nbsp;CDS are important and recognized by the highest levels of management.</p><p>We believe in hiring the best candidates for every position. &nbsp;It is for this reason that we do not restrict ourselves to arbitrary geographical locations. &nbsp;Most of our staff works on a remote basis. &nbsp;Our hiring decisions are based on one's abilities, not location.</p><p>The projects we take on run the gamut.&nbsp; Primarily we are a data and statistics provider with an emphasis on low-latency, real-time data feeds.&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly paid time off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours / work schedules</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Submissions without a portfolio included will not be considered.</p>  <p></p>  <p><strong>About Us</strong></p>  <p>At Trifacta, we’re designing a product for a growing group of users who have a very real pain. Cleaning and structuring data is both a crucial and difficult activity, a process that traditionally requires a huge amount of time and effort. We believe that transforming data shouldn’t be a painful problem and that user-centered design is particularly well suited to creating simple, intuitive, and enjoyable solutions. This is a lofty goal in a space that is traditionally deprived of usable products.</p>  <p>As designers, we recognize, perhaps more than anybody else, the value of professional tools capable not only to accommodate our needs but also to empower and inspire us in our everyday work. Our mission (and our passion) is providing our users with these same great experiences. And our target users are tough ones: smart, skilled, incredibly task-driven data analysts with unique mental models. We are facing big challenges here: building modern data tools for a large variety of users and needs in a complex and incredibly dynamic context. How can we support them in the shift from spreadsheets to the complexity of big data? How can we give users the ability to understand the impact of their work across data, projects, and organizations?</p>  <p>We are looking for a talented Senior UX Designer to help us tackling these hard challenges by working from the beginning to the end of product building, from generating new ideas to crafting detailed microinteractions. You will participate in the definition of a new generation of products capable of combining user inputs and machine learning technologies to accomplish complex tasks in simple, enjoyable ways. Come be part of an incredibly passionate, talented and diverse team in which collaboration and mutual respect are key.</p>  <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>You will articulate and convey designs via scenarios, sketches, storyboards and presentations, lo- and hi-fi mockups, detailed interaction specs, prototypes or animations.</li>   <li>You’ll drive your designs forward through every step of the design process and know what details matter at each stage: formative research, conceptual and interaction design, prototyping, and usability studies. Through this process we’d rather you show than tell.</li>   <li>You will work closely with PMs to discover and understand user needs and requirements. We hope you can help us defining what we should build, not just how to build it.</li>   <li>You will work closely with engineers to understand technical considerations and implement our designs down to the last detail.</li>   <li>You will contribute to the design, documentation and publishing of our design system.</li>   <li>Our company and processes are ever-changing, so we hope you can embrace and influence the change to make Trifacta a better place.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>You have a minimum of 3 years of industry experience in product design with a proven track record of success. You can share several great examples of real work you’ve shipped, and what you learned along the way.</li>   <li>You’ve shipped enterprise products and you feel comfortable working with and for data, juggling technical constraints and gnarly details. You know how to work with and motivate engineers to get the fit and finish right.</li>   <li>You’re a generalist with a strong focus on UI and UX. You are passionate about building users interfaces and crafting beautiful and intuitive interactions leveraging the latest web technologies.</li>   <li>You have thorough knowledge and experience across a range of design approaches, methodologies and prototyping skills.</li>   <li>You obsess over details and are excited to polish until your work is pixel-perfect.</li>   <li>You have strong written &amp; verbal communication and presentation skills. You are able to effectively structure and share your work in an international setup with 6+ hours of time difference, frequent asynchronous communications, remote design reviews, etc..</li>   <li>You are able to manage and work on multiple projects simultaneously.</li>   <li>Our team deeply values collaboration. You are passionate and committed to working with other designers and across disciplines to drive change into products. You’re confident, but willing to learn. We want to learn from you too!</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Benefits and Perks of working at Trifacta</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>You will work on an international, friendly team on one of the most exciting opportunities in the data space.</li>   <li>We will help you grow your skills through mentorships and education support.

Whether it’s with customers, employees, or a target market, SurveyMonkey helps curious individuals and companies — including 99% of the Fortune 500 — have conversations at scale with the people who matter most. It’s People Powered Data that allows them to understand not only “what” is happening, but “why.” SurveyMonkey’s 700+ employees throughout North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are dedicated to powering the curious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</strong></span></p><p>SurveyMonkey is the world’s most popular survey platform. While it is a great general-purpose tool used by millions, there is ample opportunity for more specialized solutions. That’s where we come in. We build standalone, targeted SaaS products that bring great UX to solving more specific business problems.</p><p>To date, our 12-person team has shipped three products:</p><ul><li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a> - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a> - Understand and foster employee engagement</li><li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a> - Source and publish 3rd-party verified customer proof</li></ul><p>We’re on a mission to bring better design to the business world, and while we’re at it we’d like to make our mark with stunning data viz, personable interfaces, and a commitment to empathizing with our users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></span></p><p>We’re looking for a talented designer with demonstrable experience working on user-friendly SaaS applications. Your portfolio should demonstrate the ability to design for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop. You should also be comfortable writing clear, concise UI copy.</p><p>Strong visual design, product design, usability, and communication skills are essential. Technical skills such as CSS, Javascript, and familiarity with Ruby on Rails are also a strong plus, though not required. Experience contributing to a central design system is a major plus and you will have opportunity to participate as we evolve ours.</p><p>If you’re jazzed about making really complex things super simple we should talk. If you’re interested in creating the future of intuitive data visualization (and have an opinion on what that means) we should talk. If you believe that great design belongs everywhere and have the mettle to make it happen, we should <em>definitely</em> talk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Qualifications</strong></span></p><ul><li>3+ years of experience on a product design team working across the entire product development lifecycle and successfully shipping products.</li><li>Experience working effectively with cross-functional teams including shepherding designs through the development process.</li><li>Experience collaborating with other designers to create a cohesive cross-product experience, both leveraging and contributing to a centralized design system.</li><li>Solid user-centered design fundamentals with information architecture, interaction design and visual design skills and the ability to quickly produce high quality deliverables across the range of disciplines.</li><li>Demonstrated ability to write clear, effective UI copy.</li><li>Ability to present design solutions at all levels of the organization with clear, articulate rationale.</li><li>Proficient with Sketch, Invision, Creative Suite, and knowledgeable about HTML, CSS, modern browser technologies, and cross-device design.</li><li>Portfolio showcasing examples of product design work.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Why Work Here?</strong></span></p><p>We are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific timezone by at least four hours, where you live and work and up to you. We’re not strangers though — in addition to a sane amount of video calls, we meet up quarterly to get to know each other better and have some fun. In the past year, we’ve been bowling in Phoenix, made sushi in San Francisco, and toured a brewery.</p><p>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. As such, you will be expected to be a manager of one.</p><p>Naturally, we offer competitive salaries and annual bonuses, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and meaningful equity compensation. We also supply you with top of the line equipment for your home office.</p><p>Finally, in a world of clunky “enterprise” software, we consider great UX and visual design to be a strategic advantage, and we need you to help us keep improving. Our track record gives our team a lot of autonomy — this is your chance to rethink how “business solutions” should look and function, and to have fun while doing it.</p><p>Join us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At SurveyMonkey, we offer competitive salaries, medical/dental benefits, PTO, 401k, paid holidays and parental leave, and equity compensation.</p><p>SurveyMonkey is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>  </div>",

As such, we are constantly looking for others like ourselves who are equally inventors, creators, and artists at heart to join us in the vision behind the company. We believe the kind of projects we take on require the curiosity, hunger, and worldliness that only come from being genuinely interested in both programming and finance, math and literature, art and science, polymath and autodidact.

A typical day can go from trading cryptocurrencies and building AIs to acting an impromptu skit and composing soundtracks by ear. There is no room to dabble or tag along. We are not looking for &quot;masters of none.&quot; This is not an entry level position and not a specialized role. This is not an artist support group and not an accelerator or incubator to seed ideas. We are not here to save anyone, nor are we interested in anyone wanting to save the world. This is a team for those crazy and curious enough to build rockets to Mars or fuse with AI for immortality. This is a ship for those wanting to see how far they can go and not just how long they can survive. We've built an engine that lets us tackle any project we can think of, pursue any idea we can dream of, and we’re looking for others who can take it even further, others who, like us, have a strong sense of adventure, a healthy level of insanity, and a genuine desire to take over the world... just because we can!

    "content": "We’re looking for an early career user-centred UX Designer to join a fast growing fintech startup.<br /><br />At PassFort, we share a powerful vision to enable businesses & individuals to establish trust online. We currently do this by giving regulated businesses the tools they need to automate and digitalise the onboarding, verification and management of their customers - that means customers can be onboarded in real-time, without ever having met in person. <br /><br />And this is just the beginning - our technology allows us to define what ‘trust’ means across the digital economy. Our long term aim is to create a single network where people and businesses can share their digital identity securely and interchangeably - whether they’re applying for a mortgage, listing on the stock market, or applying for a new job. We're transforming how trust is established online, in the same way that Salesforce transformed sales, Stripe transformed payments and AWS transformed DevOps.<br /><br />What you’ll be doing<br /><br />You’ll work with our Lead Designer to help solve complex user-software problems. You’ll be a voice for our users and their needs. An internal champion for exceptional product quality and the need for cohesive experiences.<br /><br />On a day-to-day basis you’ll be involved in all parts of the design process. You’ll take part in user research, uncovering and documenting under served user needs. You’ll go wide in looking for solutions to user problems, generating multiple low-fidelity potential solutions. <br /><br />Using your inclusive, open and transparent approach to work, you’ll seek out feedback from users, designers, product managers and engineers throughout the design process, receiving in good faith and using new insights to inform the direction of your work.<br /><br />Your solutions will be simple and elegant and make use of the PassFort design system which you will help to maintain and extend when necessary.<br /> <br />We see this as a development role, and if you’re driven and motivated to learn and take on more responsibility, the opportunity will be here!<br /><br />What we’re looking for<br /><br />Strong interaction design skills: You’ll have an understanding of multi-step and cross-platform flows. Proficiency in sketching and wireframing simple features and user journeys, and an understanding for the need to design for different potential states (errors, successes, dead-ends).<br />Understanding of how user research fits into the design process: You’ll be aware of different methodologies and when to use them. <br />Understanding of visual design fundamentals: layout, visual hierarchy, colour, typography, and iconography.<br />Desire to continually learn, develop your skills and evolve as a designer and have the confidence and maturity to experiment with new research and design approaches as well as new methods and tooling.<br />Ability to be comfortable with, and embrace ambiguity.<br />Working knowledge of Sketch.<br />A portfolio showing your process and decision-making skills, as well as the final deliverables.<br /><br />The Perks!<br />Equity! We want you to succeed as we do<br />Great location - we’re central to three stations, and sandwiched between Brick Lane and Spitalfields market<br />An annual learning & development budget to spend on professional or personal development, we’re invested in both<br />Birthday off - relax and put your feet up<br />Dental cover<br />Access to Perkbox - discounts to services and products (and honestly it’s fantastic)<br />Equally Enhanced Maternity/Paternity/Shared Leave pay <br />Generous holiday entitlement<br />Pension contributions - investing in your future is important<br />Pick your own equipment and kit<br />Biscuits… we’re a bit obsessed.
