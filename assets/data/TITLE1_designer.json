Every day we wake up to dozens of ecstatic messages and stories of impromptu getaways, surprise adventures and the ability to visit destinations that were prohibitively expensive.</p><p><strong>Profitable from day one. 100% bootstrapped.</strong></p><p>Our business model is simple and transparent: we offer free and premium subscriptions. Premium subscribers pay $39/year and get 100% of deals (free subscribers get ~ 1 in 3 deals), no ads in emails, and first dibs on emails. We don't get referral fees for any bookings, and our North Star is finding the best deals.</p><p>We're currently doing over $5,000,000 annual run rate. We've never taken venture capital, and instead focus on delivering as much value to subscribers as we can every day.</p><p><strong>Do the best work of your life.</strong></p><p>If your dream job is to be one of the founding members of an engineering team at a high-growth, remote company with product-market fit, we'd love to connect.</p><p>You'll work on a small (but growing!) team of developers that operate with limitless ownership, autonomy and room for growth. We value prior leadership experience, though by no means require anybody to be on a path toward management.</p><p><strong>We're a 100% remote team and wouldn't have it any other way.</strong></p><p>Unlike some remote roles, we don't have any offices, so you'll never be left out of the loop while a group of people in 'HQ' have an impromptu huddle in a conference room and make decisions while you're not there.</p><p>We rely heavily on Slack, Zoom, Google Team Drive, Geekbot asynchronous daily standups, JIRA and a few other cool tools to stay connected and in alignment.</p><p><strong>The interview process.</strong></p><p>We're a small team and move quickly. Step one is a brief&nbsp;chat with our recruiter, then a short (1-hour) design exercise, a call with our Product lead, a call with our engineers and final round chat with our co-founders, Scott and Brian. From there we'll discuss next steps, ask for a few references and get an offer out. Total time? Two weeks or less if we can align schedules.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>No commute!

If that's you and you have a portfolio to back that up, feel free to quote your hourly or project rate upfront.</p><p>Core Data currently needs an additional HTML5 web designer with react and redux experience to create a major expansion on the company's HTML5-based UI. The existing UI can be seen at this <a href='http://coredata.eu/newui' rel='nofollow'>link</a>. The existing UI is focused on displaying available offers for live (actively in play) sports games and uses a simplified navigation scheme where the user simply selects a sport, then a game, and ultimately selects what wagers are wanted.</p><p>The candidate will need to expand this User Interface to include &quot;prematch&quot; betting. Mockup designs for this have already been prepared <a href='https://coredata.eu/designer.html' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. The enhancement will keep all existing functionality of the live UI, but add a tab/screen for upcoming games that have not yet started. The list of available prematch games is numerous (sometimes in the thousands) and so the navigation scheme will be much more sophisticated than the live (current) navigation scheme. The company's goal is to have a clean, smooth, and intuitive cross-browser product.</p><p>The candidate will be expected to combine their knowledge of aesthetics and intuitive UX principles to create a cutting-edge, crisp, and attractive prematch expansion to the company's UI. The existing UI uses React.JS and Redux, so prior experience with these frameworks is necessary. The backend data to power the UI is provided vi a WebSockets feed and our backend team can make reasonable changes to the feed format if it is necessary to facilitate a speedy project completion.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/193809?reset=False&amp;ra=12ZQuM6F5hBu&amp;oqs=a%3D12ZQuM6F5hBu' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Core Data</h3>            <div><p>First and foremost, we are a software development company owned and operated entirely by professionals with a strong technical background. &nbsp;Since technology is our core focus and software is our principal product, all projects at&nbsp;CDS are important and recognized by the highest levels of management.</p><p>We believe in hiring the best candidates for every position. &nbsp;It is for this reason that we do not restrict ourselves to arbitrary geographical locations. &nbsp;Most of our staff works on a remote basis. &nbsp;Our hiring decisions are based on one's abilities, not location.</p><p>The projects we take on run the gamut.&nbsp; Primarily we are a data and statistics provider with an emphasis on low-latency, real-time data feeds.&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly paid time off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours / work schedules</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Submissions without a portfolio included will not be considered.</p>  <p></p>  <p><strong>About Us</strong></p>  <p>At Trifacta, we’re designing a product for a growing group of users who have a very real pain. Cleaning and structuring data is both a crucial and difficult activity, a process that traditionally requires a huge amount of time and effort. We believe that transforming data shouldn’t be a painful problem and that user-centered design is particularly well suited to creating simple, intuitive, and enjoyable solutions. This is a lofty goal in a space that is traditionally deprived of usable products.</p>  <p>As designers, we recognize, perhaps more than anybody else, the value of professional tools capable not only to accommodate our needs but also to empower and inspire us in our everyday work. Our mission (and our passion) is providing our users with these same great experiences. And our target users are tough ones: smart, skilled, incredibly task-driven data analysts with unique mental models. We are facing big challenges here: building modern data tools for a large variety of users and needs in a complex and incredibly dynamic context. How can we support them in the shift from spreadsheets to the complexity of big data? How can we give users the ability to understand the impact of their work across data, projects, and organizations?</p>  <p>We are looking for a talented Senior UX Designer to help us tackling these hard challenges by working from the beginning to the end of product building, from generating new ideas to crafting detailed microinteractions. You will participate in the definition of a new generation of products capable of combining user inputs and machine learning technologies to accomplish complex tasks in simple, enjoyable ways. Come be part of an incredibly passionate, talented and diverse team in which collaboration and mutual respect are key.</p>  <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>You will articulate and convey designs via scenarios, sketches, storyboards and presentations, lo- and hi-fi mockups, detailed interaction specs, prototypes or animations.</li>   <li>You’ll drive your designs forward through every step of the design process and know what details matter at each stage: formative research, conceptual and interaction design, prototyping, and usability studies. Through this process we’d rather you show than tell.</li>   <li>You will work closely with PMs to discover and understand user needs and requirements. We hope you can help us defining what we should build, not just how to build it.</li>   <li>You will work closely with engineers to understand technical considerations and implement our designs down to the last detail.</li>   <li>You will contribute to the design, documentation and publishing of our design system.</li>   <li>Our company and processes are ever-changing, so we hope you can embrace and influence the change to make Trifacta a better place.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>You have a minimum of 3 years of industry experience in product design with a proven track record of success. You can share several great examples of real work you’ve shipped, and what you learned along the way.</li>   <li>You’ve shipped enterprise products and you feel comfortable working with and for data, juggling technical constraints and gnarly details. You know how to work with and motivate engineers to get the fit and finish right.</li>   <li>You’re a generalist with a strong focus on UI and UX. You are passionate about building users interfaces and crafting beautiful and intuitive interactions leveraging the latest web technologies.</li>   <li>You have thorough knowledge and experience across a range of design approaches, methodologies and prototyping skills.</li>   <li>You obsess over details and are excited to polish until your work is pixel-perfect.</li>   <li>You have strong written &amp; verbal communication and presentation skills. You are able to effectively structure and share your work in an international setup with 6+ hours of time difference, frequent asynchronous communications, remote design reviews, etc..</li>   <li>You are able to manage and work on multiple projects simultaneously.</li>   <li>Our team deeply values collaboration. You are passionate and committed to working with other designers and across disciplines to drive change into products. You’re confident, but willing to learn. We want to learn from you too!</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Benefits and Perks of working at Trifacta</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>You will work on an international, friendly team on one of the most exciting opportunities in the data space.</li>   <li>We will help you grow your skills through mentorships and education support.

We build standalone, targeted SaaS products that bring great UX to solving more specific business problems.</p><p>To date, our 12-person team has shipped three products:</p><ul><li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a> - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a> - Understand and foster employee engagement</li><li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a> - Source and publish 3rd-party verified customer proof</li></ul><p>We’re on a mission to bring better design to the business world, and while we’re at it we’d like to make our mark with stunning data viz, personable interfaces, and a commitment to empathizing with our users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></span></p><p>We’re looking for a talented designer with demonstrable experience working on user-friendly SaaS applications. Your portfolio should demonstrate the ability to design for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop. You should also be comfortable writing clear, concise UI copy.</p><p>Strong visual design, product design, usability, and communication skills are essential. Technical skills such as CSS, Javascript, and familiarity with Ruby on Rails are also a strong plus, though not required. Experience contributing to a central design system is a major plus and you will have opportunity to participate as we evolve ours.</p><p>If you’re jazzed about making really complex things super simple we should talk. If you’re interested in creating the future of intuitive data visualization (and have an opinion on what that means) we should talk. If you believe that great design belongs everywhere and have the mettle to make it happen, we should <em>definitely</em> talk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Qualifications</strong></span></p><ul><li>3+ years of experience on a product design team working across the entire product development lifecycle and successfully shipping products.</li><li>Experience working effectively with cross-functional teams including shepherding designs through the development process.</li><li>Experience collaborating with other designers to create a cohesive cross-product experience, both leveraging and contributing to a centralized design system.</li><li>Solid user-centered design fundamentals with information architecture, interaction design and visual design skills and the ability to quickly produce high quality deliverables across the range of disciplines.</li><li>Demonstrated ability to write clear, effective UI copy.</li><li>Ability to present design solutions at all levels of the organization with clear, articulate rationale.</li><li>Proficient with Sketch, Invision, Creative Suite, and knowledgeable about HTML, CSS, modern browser technologies, and cross-device design.</li><li>Portfolio showcasing examples of product design work.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Why Work Here?</strong></span></p><p>We are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific timezone by at least four hours, where you live and work and up to you. We’re not strangers though — in addition to a sane amount of video calls, we meet up quarterly to get to know each other better and have some fun. In the past year, we’ve been bowling in Phoenix, made sushi in San Francisco, and toured a brewery.</p><p>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. As such, you will be expected to be a manager of one.</p><p>Naturally, we offer competitive salaries and annual bonuses, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and meaningful equity compensation. We also supply you with top of the line equipment for your home office.</p><p>Finally, in a world of clunky “enterprise” software, we consider great UX and visual design to be a strategic advantage, and we need you to help us keep improving. Our track record gives our team a lot of autonomy — this is your chance to rethink how “business solutions” should look and function, and to have fun while doing it.</p><p>Join us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At SurveyMonkey, we offer competitive salaries, medical/dental benefits, PTO, 401k, paid holidays and parental leave, and equity compensation.</p><p>SurveyMonkey is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>  </div>",
