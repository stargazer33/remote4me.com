That includes branding, helping with marketing materials, and polishing external documents.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong><br>You’ll be embedded with engineering and work closely with the founders to create delightful products. Starting from a problem our customers face, you’ll work with engineers to design a solution. This will be an iterative process of talking to customers, wire-framing, and working with engineers. As the solution becomes better defined, you’ll provide engineers high fidelity UI mockups.</p><p>In addition to day to day feature development, you’ll play an integral part in defining the product direction and strategy, helping create a cohesive product experience. You’ll also own the UI and brand visual direction.</p><p><strong>What We Value</strong></p><p>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, challenging the status quo, nothing is “not my job”, having empathy, being direct, and being honest.</p><p><strong>What We Offer</strong></p><ul><li>Autonomy, impact, and ownership. As an early employee you’ll shape the product direction and company values.</li><li>Competitive salary and significant equity in a fast growing, early stage startup.</li><li><strong>Remote employment – work where you want, when you want.</strong></li><li>Generous vacation policy – take time whenever you need to recharge. Building a lasting company is a marathon, not a sprint.</li><li>Top-notch healthcare, dental, and vision coverage.</li><li>Life and disability insurance.</li><li><strong>Annual company retreat – helps build camaraderie as a remote team.</strong></li><li>Computer and home office setup – we’ll buy anything you need to do your best work.</li><li>Continuing education allowance – learn what you want, when you want.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/interviewschedulecom/view/P_AAAAAAIAAFWBL6Ag_SSxHs' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We empower people to do what they love from anywhere in the world. Our vision is to blend the best of human creativity with the power of Machine Learning to reimagine collaboration with each other, and partnership with our clients.</p><p>We believe that if you hire talented folks, lead with trust, and give people the tools they need to succeed, then creativity will come. Our team is completely distributed, but we’re building new modes of operation together.</p><p>Our team leverages technology to collaborate because we want to, dives into deep work when we need to, and (every so often) connects in real life because we like to. With us, you get the opportunity to be curious and collaborate with passionate peers, without sacrificing autonomy or career ownership.</p><p>Plato is proud to be backed by Y Combinator and some of Silicon Valley’s best investors.

Most projects will require constructing brand identities by creating mood boards to align direction with a client and crafting visual identities (ie logo type, mark, guidelines) for a client’s brand. You’ll be compensated based on the complexity of the project.</p><p>Ideal Brand Designer candidates have a high quality bar, with a portfolio that displays a range of project types, aesthetics and use cases. You should have a track record of success delivering high quality work on schedule, and should enjoy collaborating as a part of a fast moving team.

    "content": "About us<br /><br />Disperse is a VC-backed artificial intelligence construction startup focused on improving on-site productivity with the help of computer vision. Our goal is to ultimately re-imagine the way building projects are planned, delivered and operated.<br /><br />We're currently working on some of the largest building projects in London (e.g. Renzo Piano’s Shard Place, Wood Wharf) and have grown from 5 to 35 people over the past year. We have ambitions to expand significantly, which means that we are looking for passionate and enthusiastic talent to join the team.<br /><br />We move at a high speed, and will provide you with immense opportunities for initiative, creativity and leadership. Our proudly diverse, international team is based in London, Sarajevo and Yerevan, and has a wealth of experience from construction management to computer vision and robotics.<br /><br /><br />Your role<br /><br />We are looking for an entrepreneurial UX designer with a passion for great products and digital technologies. There is no better time to join our growing team, as you will have the rare opportunity to establish yourself as our first design leader, as you find, onboard and mentor the next generation of Disperse designers across our international offices. Our ideal team member is ready to take on both business growth and design challenges, and is excited to creatively embed design into artificial intelligence-based solutions to solve the age old productivity gap in the construction industry.<br /><br />Not only will you have a lead role in growing our design function, but you will also be a core member of our growing Product team, collaborating closely with our product managers and engineers right from product inception and discovery through to delivery. Your key responsibilities will include:<br /><br />Building, leading and mentoring a team of talented UI and UX designers and freelancers.<br />Owning our UX product design streams, and prototyping your way to validated, delightfully simple experiences for our customers.<br />Envisioning and implementing an industry-defining customer experience across all touchpoints - both on and off of our platform.<br />Developing a deep understanding of our customers’ workflows and pain points, through conducting user research, user testing, and running workshops.<br />Partnering with our awesome product managers and engineers to collaboratively design and deliver solutions that will transcend an entire industry.<br />Leading the definition, development and operation of our Design System and language.<br />Fostering our human-centred design culture across the entire business, and sharing your deep domain knowledge with everyone on the team.<br /><br />Our culture<br /><br />Ask anyone at Disperse what they love most about working here, and they'll probably tell you &quot;it's the people!&quot;, &quot;the team, of course&quot;, &quot;the people and the Hedwig owls in the offices&quot;.<br /><br />As clichéd as it may sound, we're very proud of the people we have and the close-knit, family culture we've built across London, Sarajevo and Yerevan. Despite the distances, we're united through the passion with which we approach our goals and the fun that we have along the way. We always look out for each other, no matter what. The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:<br /><br />We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.<br />We support each other. If a process breaks or if you're struggling, you can always count on the people around you and the people far away from you, to help you get back on track.<br />We run on feedback: direct and transparent praise and constructive criticism, communicated with the best of intentions. There is no other way to learn!<br />Ideas and approaches are always judged on merit rather than source. We welcome discussions and challenges. This way everyone makes a tremendous impact no matter the role.<br /><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />You should apply if:<br /><br />You have an insatiable passion for UX design and its latest trends, and a keen interest in disruptive technologies.<br />You own a portfolio that can take us on a design user journey for at least two extensive digital projects and can give us insight into your design process and decision-making skills.<br />You have 3+ years of work experience in a digital UX role.<br />You have excellent command of product design and prototyping tools, such as Sketch/Figma, InVision, Indesign/Illustrator/Photoshop.<br />You have proven experience in facilitating design workshops and managing both stakeholder and customer relationships.<br />You are well-versed in UX research methodologies including ethnographic research, user testing, usability testing and A/B testing.<br />You're eligible to work in the UK. No visa sponsorship is available for this position.<br /><br />Desirable but not essential:<br /><br />You have experience growing and leading design teams, and mentoring junior designers.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />Pro-rata salary of £50,000 - £70,000 per annum plus generous option package (depending on experience level).<br />Private health insurance.<br />25 days’ holiday plus all bank holidays.<br />Friendly, open and transparent culture.<br />You'll get to join a passionate startup with proven traction on its scaling journey.<br />Flexible working hours / ability to work from home.<br />Awesome startup office in Central London, Fitzrovia.<br />Free coffee.<br />Regular socials, and team retreats to amazing destinations (Tbilisi, Sarajevo... Where next?)<br /><br />Disperse welcomes applications from all sections of society. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other basis as protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.<br /><br /><br />The process<br />The interview process will involve:<br /><br />1-hour on-site portfolio walkthrough and cultural chat;<br />Design case study for us to get a sense of how you tackle problems - completed in your own time;<br />2-hour on-site interview: presentation of case study with Q&A, followed by technical and cultural chats with different members of the team.<br />This process should take up to two weeks, depending on diaries.

Are you comfortable doing high-level conceptual explorations one day and ‘perfecting pixels’ the next?</p><p>Help us help the UX teams at the largest e-commerce sites in the world.</p><p>We’re looking for a UI web designer to be the primary person responsible for the designs of baymard.com and Baymard Premium, our research subscription service.</p><p>You’ll essentially be responsible for the interface design of Baymard’s end-user experience — making our research a pleasure to use for the thousands of web professionals that rely on it, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.</p><p><strong><em>This is a remote full-time position.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Examples of What You’ll Be Doing</strong></p><p>Two examples of the types of interfaces you’ll be working on designing and improving over time.</p><p>Below are some concrete examples of what typical design tasks would look like:</p><ul><li>Web UI design. You’ll deep-dive on creating perfected and harmonic UIs for Baymard’s key pages and website elements. That could be improving the aesthetics of pages such as the Case Studies, Annotated Screenshots, Homepage, etc.</li><li>Extensive visual explorations of new features. Often you’ll be given a project brief for an upcoming feature, and will then be working on exploring the full solution space of possible UIs. A brief could be something like:&nbsp;<em>“Explore a series of concrete design concepts for a new element to be added to our case study pages that highlights the 10 most interesting examples from the reviewed website.”</em>.</li><li>Optimize the designs of text-heavy pages. As many of our key pages contain long texts (by web standards, at least) — including our Audit Service, Product Page, Research Articles, etc. — even small incremental gains in the reading experience have a dramatic impact on our overall UX.</li><li>Create interactive mockups. You’ll sometimes make interactive versions of the final design so our team of UX researchers can play around with it and get a crystal clear idea of what the final feature would feel like. These interactive mockups will furthermore serve as a “design spec” for our developers.</li><li>Quality assure the implemented versions of your design. Following your designs all the way from early idea through final implementation, reviewing and communicating to our developers what needs to be tweaked in order to realize the design’s vision and objectives.</li></ul><p>If you enjoy such challenges, you’ll be the perfect candidate.</p><p><strong>About Your Job at Baymard</strong></p><p>Your job will be building out and refining the UI of Baymard’s web platform.</p><p>At Baymard you’ll be working alongside a team of dedicated usability researchers that conduct cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Amazon, Home Depot, Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc). Your job will be creating the designs for new features and refining the existing designs of Baymard’s web platform.</p><ul><li>Work – Your primary responsibility will be exploring, evolving, and polishing the UI designs of Baymard’s web platform called Baymard Premium (this is the “delivery vehicle” for all of our research work). You’ll be working closely with the founders of Baymard and our small in-house developer team. You’ll often be starting with already identified project goals, user needs, and overarching concepts for solutions, and then yourself: explore the full ‘solution space’, detail the UI components, present your work to the team, revise your designs based on their feedback, build interactive prototypes, polish the aesthetics, then polish the aesthetics some more, and lastly, ensure that when the final feature is developed it matches the vision of your work and our project.</li><li>Team – Most of Baymard’s 15-people team are UX researchers. While our research teams know everything about user behavior, they don’t create new designs themselves. You will therefore be the “owner” of Baymard’s designs, and must therefore take joy in leading the design efforts of baymard.com, our internal tools, and most importantly Baymard Premium (our research subscription service).</li><li><strong>Remote – We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which 90% of our employees do). If you want to, you’re of course also welcome to work in our Copenhagen-based office (or a mix!).</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p><p>Excellent UI design skills are a prerequisite for this position.</p><p>Specifically, we’re looking for candidates who possess the following skills and personal traits. The numbers in brackets indicate the weighted importance of each on a 7-point scale (higher = more important). These weights reflect how candidates will be evaluated, so make sure your application illustrates your prowess in the highest-weighted skills and traits.</p><p><strong>Skills for this position:</strong></p><ul><li>[7/7] User Interface design of websites — you can perfect and polish all visual details of a User Interface to create perfect shading, page harmony, element proximity, style consistency throughout the site, etc., and make text-heavy pages aesthetically pleasing without sacrificing readability.</li><li>[5/7] Translating abstract concept to concrete design explorations — you’re able to take an identified user problem and overarching concept for a solution (as text-only descriptions), and then perform a series of visual design explorations of that solution in order to validate and stress-test assumptions around the final end-user experience.</li><li>[4/7] Ability to do interactive mockups — you can create clickable prototypes of UI designs to illustrate features, flows, and interactive components.</li><li>[3/7] Quality assurance — you know how to review features once they have been developed, and provide helpful feedback to developers that help them implement the design and project vision; including communicating and collaborating directly with developers to create smart compromises.&nbsp;<em>This is a “nice-to-have”.</em></li><li>[1/7] Technical understanding — understanding of technical implications and limitations.&nbsp;<em>This is a “nice-to-have”.</em></li><li>[1/7] Copywriting and marketing — can write microcopy and has an appreciation for marketing and how design fits into that.&nbsp;<em>This is a “nice-to-have”.</em></li></ul><p><strong>Traits we’re looking for:</strong></p><ul><li>[7/7] Independent — as there won’t be any other “design champions” on the team, you must be independent and unafraid to face new challenges on your own.</li><li>[3/7] Meta-level awareness — you should be capable of doing both high-level and low-level work without conflating the two; in other words, not “getting lost in the details” or afraid to share early first drafts during the early project phases when doing high-level explorations; yet in the later project phases also being capable of polishing the last 5% before a design goes into development.&nbsp;<em>This is a “nice-to-have”.</em></li></ul><p><strong>We furthermore expect you to be fluent in english, comfortable working remotely via digital platforms, and willing to do a few yearly travels for team meetups (expect 1-3 weeks of travel each year).</strong></p><p>Interest in UX research and e-commerce is a small bonus, but no experience or skills are necessary in this area as you’ll work with (and have the option to learn from) the best in the industry.</p><p><em>Salary: in accordance with qualifications.</em><br><em>Start date: as soon as possible.</em></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://baymard.com/jobs/designer' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.</div><div><br></div><div>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;<em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases, results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.</div><div><br></div><div>See how our clients&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we've received</a>&nbsp;so far.

We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!</div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>A Day In The Life</span></h3></div><div><br></div><div>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>What Does Success Look Like?</span></h3></div><div><br></div><div>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll receive extensive on the job training including a customized trail of technical assessments and assignments. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</div><div><br></div><div>You'll have dedicated pairing time scheduled with various colleagues to cover different skills, and we'll even participate in several mock client meetings so your first standup or sprint planning meeting doesn't carry with it the weight of your first client interaction. After this training period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<span><em>Welcome aboard!</em></span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Ongoing Support</span></div><div><br></div><div>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>Individual quarterly goal progress</li><li>Project status / team issues / weekly retro</li><li>Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire<br><br></li></ul><div><span>Quarterly and Annual Reviews</span></div><div><br></div><div>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We're here to grow with you sustainably over the long term.</div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>Experience and Results At Every Level</span></h3></div><div><br></div><div>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019.

Your job will be creating the designs for new features and refining the existing designs of Baymard’s web platform.</p><ul><li><strong>Work</strong> – Your primary responsibility will be exploring, evolving, and polishing the UI designs of Baymard’s web platform called Baymard Premium (this is the “delivery vehicle” for all of our research work). You’ll be working closely with the founders of Baymard and our small in-house developer team. You’ll often be starting with already identified project goals, user needs, and overarching concepts for solutions, and then yourself: explore the full ‘solution space’, detail the UI components, present your work to the team, revise your designs based on their feedback, build interactive prototypes, polish the aesthetics, then polish the aesthetics some more, and lastly, ensure that when the final feature is developed it matches the vision of your work and our project.</li><li><strong>Team</strong> – Most of Baymard’s 15-people team are UX researchers. While our research teams know everything about user behavior, they don’t create new designs themselves. You will therefore be the “owner” of Baymard’s designs, and must therefore take joy in leading the design efforts of baymard.com, our internal tools, and most importantly Baymard Premium (our research subscription service).</li><li><strong>Remote</strong> – We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work.

If we end up hiring the person you referred, we’ll give you one year of access to a Baymard Premium ‘<a href='https://baymard.com/research' rel='nofollow'>Medium</a>’ plan (a $1,560 value).</em></p><h5>Key Work Values at Baymard</h5><p>The following work values are central to us at Baymard and hopefully gives you an idea of our culture and what working at Baymard is like:</p><ul><li><strong>Flat organization</strong> – Baymard is a small organization of just ~15 people. This means zero management layers between you and final decision. You’ll have direct access to and impact on decision making.</li><li><strong>Lots of responsibility</strong> – From day 1 (OK, maybe day 2) you will be working on final products or services. We believe the best way to learn is to work an actual products and challenges, supplemented with rich ‘early feedback’.</li><li><strong>Long-term focus</strong> – Decisions are always based on their long term impact. We’re not interested in hunting after the next “quick win” — we want to make a lasting impact on the e-commerce industry and usually adopt a 5-year perspective in our decisions and projects.</li><li><strong>Remote from the ground up</strong> – 90% of the team works remotely. We’ve deliberately designed the organization around remote work. That said, we do bring the entire team together for a week once a year somewhere interesting in the world. (In past meetups we snowmobiled glaciers on Iceland, went to NYC, etc.)</li><li><strong>Team of ‘subject matter’ nerds</strong> – Everyone geeks out a bit on their work interests. We love that, and once a week someone from the team does a 20min presentation on their latest obsession — whether it’s quasi-quantum-worlds or the proper usage of hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes.</li><li><strong>Founders engaged in the product</strong> – We believe it is essential that those orchestrating the work of the organization are keenly in tune with all aspects of it. The two founders of Baymard have therefore performed every type of task in the organization themselves (from programming to UX testing), and continue to work directly on the product.</li></ul><p>Do your values match those?

This means zero management layers between you and final decision. You’ll have direct access to and impact on decision making.</li><li><strong>Lots of responsibility</strong> – From day 1 (OK, maybe day 2) you will be working on final products or services. We believe the best way to learn is to work an actual products and challenges, supplemented with rich ‘early feedback’.</li><li><strong>Long-term focus</strong> – Decisions are always based on their long term impact. We’re not interested in hunting after the next “quick win” — we want to make a lasting impact on the e-commerce industry and usually adopt a 5-year perspective in our decisions and projects.</li><li><strong>Remote from the ground up</strong> – 90% of the team works remotely. We’ve deliberately designed the organization around remote work. That said, we do bring the entire team together for a week once a year somewhere interesting in the world. (In past meetups we snowmobiled glaciers on Iceland, went to NYC, etc.)</li><li><strong>Team of ‘subject matter’ nerds</strong> – Everyone geeks out a bit on their work interests. We love that, and once a week someone from the team does a 20min presentation on their latest obsession — whether it’s quasi-quantum-worlds or the proper usage of hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes.</li><li><strong>Founders engaged in the product</strong> – We believe it is essential that those orchestrating the work of the organization are keenly in tune with all aspects of it. The two founders of Baymard have therefore performed every type of task in the organization themselves (from programming to UX testing), and continue to work directly on the product.</li></ul><p>Do your values match those?

Are you comfortable doing high-level conceptual explorations one day and ‘perfecting pixels’ the next?</i></div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for a UI web designer to be the primary person responsible for the designs of baymard.com and Baymard Premium, our research subscription service.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll essentially be responsible for the interface design of Baymard’s end-user experience — making our research a pleasure to use for the thousands of web professionals that rely on it, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.</div><div><br></div><div><i>This is a remote full-time position.</i></div><div><br></div><div>Read a well-formatted version of this job posting on our website:</div><div>https://baymard.com/jobs/designer</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><b>Examples of What You'll Be Doing</b></div><div><br></div><div>Below are some concrete examples of what typical design tasks would look like:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Web UI design</b> — You’ll deep-dive on creating perfected and harmonic UIs for Baymard’s key pages and website elements. That could be improving the aesthetics of pages such as the Case Studies (http://bit.ly/2X4lukY), Annotated Screenshots (http://bit.ly/2KjvwbZ), Homepage (http://bit.ly/2WDN1p9), etc.</li><li><b>Extensive visual explorations of new features</b> — Often you’ll be given a project brief for an upcoming feature, and will then be working on exploring the full solution space of possible UIs. A brief could be something like: <i>“Explore a series of concrete design concepts for a new element to be added to our case study pages (http://bit.ly/2X4lukY)&nbsp;that highlights the 10 most interesting examples from the reviewed website.”</i></li><li><b>Optimize the designs of text-heavy pages</b> — As many of our key pages contain long texts (by web standards, at least) — including our Audit Service (http://bit.ly/2WI8OAG), Product Page (http://bit.ly/2IeAi8r), Research Articles (http://bit.ly/2F2ahHp), etc. — even small incremental gains in the reading experience have a dramatic impact on our overall UX.</li><li><b>Create interactive mockups</b> — You’ll sometimes make interactive versions of the final design so our team of UX researchers can play around with it and get a crystal clear idea of what the final feature would feel like. These interactive mockups will furthermore serve as a “design spec” for our developers.</li><li><b>Quality assure the implemented versions of your design</b> — Following your designs all the way from early idea through final implementation, reviewing and communicating to our developers what needs to be tweaked in order to realize the design’s vision and objectives.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If you enjoy such challenges, you’ll be the perfect candidate.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>About Your Job at Baymard</b></div><div><br></div><div>At Baymard you’ll be working alongside a team of dedicated usability researchers that conduct cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Amazon, Home Depot, Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc). Your job will be creating the designs for new features and refining the existing designs of Baymard’s web platform.</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Work</b><span> – Your primary responsibility will be exploring, evolving, and polishing the UI designs of Baymard’s web platform called Baymard Premium (this is the “delivery vehicle” for all of our research work). You’ll be working closely with the founders of Baymard and our small in-house developer team. You’ll often be starting with already identified project goals, user needs, and overarching concepts for solutions, and then yourself: explore the full ‘solution space’, detail the UI components, present your work to the team, revise your designs based on their feedback, build interactive prototypes, polish the aesthetics, then polish the aesthetics some more, and lastly, ensure that when the final feature is developed it matches the vision of your work and our project.</span></li><li><b>Team</b><span> – Most of Baymard’s 15-people team are UX researchers. While our research teams know everything about user behavior, they don’t create new designs themselves. You will therefore be the “owner” of Baymard’s designs, and must therefore take joy in leading the design efforts of baymard.com, our internal tools, and most importantly Baymard Premium (our research subscription service).</span></li><li><b>Remote</b><span> – We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which 90% of our employees do).

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that’s a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it.</p><p>Because we’re more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;<em>build a business</em>&nbsp;―not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases, results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow.</p><p>See how our clients&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/case-studies/rise/' rel='nofollow'>talk</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/compass/' rel='nofollow'>our approach</a>&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/2018-addys/' rel='nofollow'>recognition we’ve received</a>&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/holiday-collaboration-with-velodrome-coffee/' rel='nofollow'>holiday gifts</a>&nbsp;each year. Or, if you’re a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/seaworthy/' rel='nofollow'>Seaworthy</a>, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We’re excited about what we’ve achieved in the last few years, but we’re just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level!</p><h3><span>A Day In The Life</span></h3><p>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-winter-retreat-2018/' rel='nofollow'>team</a>&nbsp;week&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/headway-team-week-july-2018/' rel='nofollow'>recaps</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='http://headway.io/blog/a-look-back-at-2017/' rel='nofollow'>years in review</a>&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway!</p><h3><span>What Does Success Look Like?</span></h3><p>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you’ll receive extensive on the job training including a customized trail of technical assessments and assignments. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more.</p><p>You’ll have dedicated pairing time scheduled with various colleagues to cover different skills, and we’ll even participate in several mock client meetings so your first standup or sprint planning meeting doesn’t carry with it the weight of your first client interaction. After this training period, you’ll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You’ll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;<span><em>Welcome aboard!</em></span></p><p><span>Ongoing Support</span></p><p>Each week, you’ll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include:</p><ul><li>Individual quarterly goal progress</li><li>Project status / team issues / weekly retro</li><li>Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire</li></ul><p><span>Quarterly and Annual Reviews</span></p><p>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time.

Why is this amazing? Because design is the killer app for crypto and the distributed web, and our mission is to improve humanity’s most important technology: the internet. We can’t do it without user-centered designers like you! We have a rare opportunity to research and build at the core of how the internet could work, and make its next version easier to use and more inclusive.</p>  <p><em>Tell us about how <em>you</em> work! You don’t need experience in 100% of these responsibilities, and we’d like to hear about your unique perspective on this role.</em></p>  <p><strong>Some challenges you could work on include:</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>What does identity verification look like in a decentralized system?</li>   <li>How do trust and trust systems manifest in systems where people are exchanging data, instead of relying on centralized systems, and how should we design for that?</li>   <li>Technologies and protocols like IPFS let you distribute identical copies of your data across a dynamic, scalable network of peers (instead of relying on a centralized cloud). How should a UI communicate to users what ‘sharing on the internet’ means in the future? How could systems support stewarding data together in such a system?</li>   <li>What does a UI kit look like for distributed web apps, and what changes (if any) should we make for the different ways people might interact with the distributed web?</li>   <li>We have to talk about this brave new world in ways that humans can understand.

Did you have fun doing it?  Could you explain to them why it was not working? <br /><br />Are you the person who everyone asks for help with their mobile phone or computer?  Do you enjoy it for the fun - and wish you could get paid for it?<br /><br />And, what about being part of a fast-paced startup environment? Would that be interesting?  If so, then this role is for you!<br /><br />*Who is OWLR?*<br />&quot;OWLR&quot;:http://www.owlr.com is a multinational team working to make home security cameras smarter, simpler and even more secure.  Rather than being a boring alarm company, we here at OWLR are injecting humour, ease of use and amazing user experiences into our products to make Moms and Dads really happy.<br /><br />One of the key parts of our business are the people who work with our users through email and chats. You would be the front face of our company with our users and get your hands dirty with testing our apps with cameras from around the world and being the discoverer of what works and does not work with our products.  <br /><br />You get to work from your home office, with a great team and gain a set of amazing experiences.<br /><br />*WHAT ARE YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES?*<br />As the User Advocate, you will:<br /><br />* *Engage with Users on Email and Forums* - our users send us emails to solve their problems, and you get to use our Knowledge base and engineers to find solutions and reply in a prompt and friendly manner.  You get to use your problem solving skills to diagnose and teach them the steps to solve their problem - since every question is often a new puzzle each time.<br /><br />* *Engage with Users on Apple App Store and Google Play Store* - with over 1.7M downloads, we get lots of compliments and chats on the Apple and Google App Stores - and you are the voice of the product there.<br /><br />* *Play with and test the Apps as we release them* - since the engineers are furiously working to build better apps for our users, you are the key person who learns what we are doing, and how we can make sure we serve the users first and foremost.<br /><br />*WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR*<br />*You.  Or someone like you.*  You will likely have some enthusiasms that we are looking to work with:<br /><br />* *KEY SKILL: You love the English language* - you use words to explain thoughts and care about spelling, even a bit of grammar and love showing off your vocabulary.  Our team is distributed around the world and your skill in communication is key to make everything work out right.<br /><br />* *You act with a sense of responsibility* - rather than an office environment with your boss looking over your head, you OWN your tasks and deliver on them to your users and the whole team’s needs.<br /><br />* *KEY SKILL: You love to solve problems and dive right in* - you want to solve problems and look for cause and effect, triggers and outcomes.  We have plenty of technology puzzles in that our past staff of engineers, teachers, literature students, designer and others on how to solve - it always comes down to YOUR interest and ability to solve puzzles.<br /><br />* *KEY SKILL: You have a high level of emotional intelligence, empathy and maturity* – can you stay calm and professional, even when under pressure?  Because our users are people too!  They and the engineers (and the CEO) all have passion for our product, and you are the tip of the soft sword making things better for us all.<br /><br />* *You are adaptable and have a real sense of humor* – life is unpredictable and we can guarantee that no day “at the office” will ever be the same.<br /><br />* *You have the confidence to speak out on behalf of the users* - instead of treating our users as ATMs, we work hard to make our users successful - because when users are happy, we are successful.  YOU have the responsibility and the empathy to make changes.<br /><br />* *You are a stickler for detail* - you are the one that tells us when things are going wrong on the web, in reviews, in our emails - you are the person who makes us look great!<br /><br />* *You have a SOLID Internet connection (or could get one)* - you need to be well-connected and have solid computer skills.<br /><br />* *You have a general understanding of technology and the ability to understand how software works* - this may seem simple, but do you know how Microsoft Word works?  How the file is stored on the system and how Word saves files and makes edits?  How the webpage you pulled up in your browser showed up there?  And would you LIKE to learn?<br /><br />*IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU HAD...*<br />Yeah - this is a list of other traits that are possible, but you will likely learn as you work with us and the team.  Things like:<br /><br />* *General Network Technology Understanding* (e.g. What is an IP address?  What are ports?  What is DNS for?

    "content": "<span><h2>Visual Designer&nbsp;</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>Ghost</h3></span> <span>Worldwide</span> <span></span> <span>verified</span> <div>  <div>   As the company grows, we're looking to expand our design team and improve everything about the Ghost brand and how it's represented to our users and customers. We care, deeply, about great design and experience — at the expense of most other things. Design work has a very strong voice here.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>This is a broad role which is about leading design in lots of different areas, primarily around all of our brand, marketing, website, and just about every property that our users will come into contact with.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>All of Ghost's design was initially done by our Founder/CEO - John, and today our design is led by Zimo - who spends the majority of his time deeply focused on our product. You'll be the 3rd member of the Ghost design team, so you'll have a massive amount of opportunity to influence design across the entire organisation.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We're looking for a visual designer with a deep understanding of marketing, branding, and user communication — and who cares deeply about quality, and helping to create (+evolve) a refined, beautiful style.   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> ⚡️ Working with design and marketing leadership to define, evolve, and maintain Ghost's brand identity across all marketing and product touch points.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br> Creation of websites, landing pages, diagrams, illustrations, stickers, tshirts, checkout flows, billing management. You'll lead all of our most public facing properties and brand assets. The visual voice of the company.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br> You'll work with the marketing/business team on projects which are directly related to growing the business and creating user-facing content.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br> Designers at Ghost work on different cross-functional teams, there's still plenty of collaboration and feedback between teammates to help and support each other throughout various projects.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br> Lots of freedom to take control of your process, iterating and learning what works (and what doesn't), and putting your work into production. There's a lot of opportunity for professional growth here, as the team expands.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br> Communicating effectively with stakeholders when presenting your work and clearly articulating your design rationale   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>⚖️ Managing multiple projects, while setting appropriate expectations and meeting realistic deadlines   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>* An underdog. We aren't hiring flashy designers from Fortune 500's here, we're looking for real human people who like to do great work. If you don't think you're good enough for this role, then you're probably exactly who we'd like to join the team. Please do apply!   <br>   <br>* Fiercely independent. All teams at Ghost operate fairly autonomously, and all team members are responsible for helping make decisions about what needs to be done. You'll need to be comfortable ideating, prototyping, testing and delivering designs without someone standing over your shoulder telling you what to do.   <br>   <br>* Meticulous about style. Despite frequent character assassination amongst UX professionals, aesthetic style matters a great deal. We don't A/B test 50 shades of blue here to determine what converts best, we care about making beautiful things which we love.   <br>   <br>* Humble but opinionated. We like smart people who have lots of ideas, yet are happy to discard their former opinions whenever a better way of doing things presents itself.   <br>   <br>* A clear communicator. Good design is good communication, and as a remote team which communicates almost exclusively through writing — concise, written communication is absolutely essential to this role.   <br>   <br>* An active collaborator. We look for people who actively want critical feedback on their work early and often, and who get a kick out of refining and pushing what they do as a collaborative process because it creates a better end result. No design heroes.   <br>   <br>* Comfortable with code. Ghost is a software company, and everyone here codes in one way or another. You don't need to be an expert, but you do need to be actively open to learning and working with code to do design.   <br>   <br>* Hungry for meaningful work, and space to do it. Almost all work at Ghost is complex and extremely challenging - but also deeply rewarding. We're not in the slightest bit fucking interested in what Design-Twitter thinks about... well, anything at all really. We're aggressively uncool.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>This role would be particularly suited to someone with a background as a freelancer or at an agency, who is looking for more, that they aren't getting from doing client work. This is a role where you can help influence design over the long term, not just fulfil a temporary brief which needs to be delivered quickly.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We don't mind where you're based or what hours you work, but this role does require reasonable working-hours overlap with the rest of our product/marketing teams in Europe.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We value diversity of all types at Ghost and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We have as many people who speak German as we do English and our engineering team contains as many women as it does men. Some of us are single, others are married, while others are parents. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",
