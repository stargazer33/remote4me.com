We are trying to solve a massive problem in the B2B world and we are very excited to be amongst the first ones tackling it.<br /><br />What will you be doing?<br /><br />As the first designer in the company, you will have the opportunity to set up the standards in how the design process works. As a product team, we trust each individual to be autonomous and work towards are shared goals. We are fully committed in supporting one another in any way possible.<br /><br />Act as a champion that drives product ideas from start to completion: from research insights, to workflows all the way to visual designs.<br /><br />Sketch and prototype ideas to quickly access viability, and design the fine grained details of interactions.<br />Iterate based on feedback from the whole team.<br />Work closely with engineers as they build and ship ideas.<br /><br />What skills and experience do I need?<br /><br />We are looking for product designers that have done this before. You will be designer #1 which is very exciting and you will get to set the tone of our product.<br /><br />Experience designing digital products and systems (styleguides), not just websites. You have helped ship products.<br />An appreciation of the entire product development process, from problem solving through to detailed UI and visual design.<br /><br />The ability to create mockups of your designs.<br />Excellent communicator that can articulate the thought behind proposals.<br />Able to collaborate with the engineers and the wider company on strategy and delivery.<br />Where will I be working from?<br /><br />Normally you will be working from our Angel offices (right next to the station) but we are a remote friendly bunch so you can adjust your schedule as you see fit.<br /><br />What would I be paid?<br /><br />Our pay is within the top 10% of the industry, for the matched role and experience, based on London rates. According to the market at the moment, we aim to pay £70,000 for the role.<br /><br />Salary is not everything. Our benefits are all aimed at supporting a life well lived away from work. We don't offer free beers or Coke on tap but rather:<br /><br />25 days off per annum plus bank holidays.<br />35 hours / week. Normal working hours are between 10am – 6pm.<br />Work from home whenever. If you prefer to come to the office everyday that’s great, if you prefer to work from home 4 times a week that’s fantastic. Whatever works for you. As a team we will make sure you are not missing out by pushing remote first practices. Flexibility to adjust your daily hours. Visiting friends and family in another country, going to the bank or the gym, you only need to have an overlap between our core hours (12am – 4pm) for 6 hours. As an example, you can start at 8am and finish at 4pm or 12am and finish at 8pm.<br /><br />How to apply?<br /><br />Where you have previously worked does not really matter. If you have a Linkedin profile, just to have a more general idea, send it through, no CV is needed in that case. Instead, send us through a cover letter where you explain more about your experience. We would like you to express:<br /><br />What have you worked on that you are the most proud of?<br />What do you enjoy working on the most?<br />How do you approach the design process?<br />What would you like to work on here?<br /><br />In the interview process we will go through a particular piece of work (your choice) that you have delivered, detailing the approach around it, challenges and learnings. We're looking for a feature/research that clearly outlines the problems you were tackling with your design work. It should touch on the process you applied to tackling the challenges, rather than focusing just on visuals and landing pages. We would like to go through from inception to interactions and the visual design. The work should ideally focus on designing software products.<br /><br />We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are always eager to further diversify our company.<br /><br />",

Must-have qualifications are technical proficiency with InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator, as well as experience producing print products.</p><p>Most of all, we’re on the hunt for an original thinker who can both dream big and work intelligently in order to make great concepts a reality for our Authors.</p><p>If you can nail all the above, you’re probably pretty awesome, which brings us to an important question:</p><p><strong>Who are we and what do we do?</strong></p><p>We’re <strong>Scribe Media</strong>, and our mission is to help everyone on earth write, publish and market their book. The problem is that writing and publishing books are, for most people, a painful and difficult process, loaded with uncertainty and aggravation. Our goal is to make it as simple as possible, so that as many people as possible can do it. We have multiple ways we help people do this. We can edit and publish an already written manuscript (Scribe Publishing), or we can help people write their book using a structured process with our guidance (Scribe Guided Author), or we can do a structured interview process that gets the book out of them in their words and their voice (Scribe Professional). And if you can’t afford our services, that’s fine. We give away all of our information for free. Seriously, it’s called Scribe Book School, and it’s better than any paid course on the internet.</p><p><strong>Why our work matters</strong></p><p>Our company was started because a frustrated entrepreneur wanted to put all of her incredible knowledge and ideas into a book, but didn’t have the time to write it or the patience to deal with the frustrating publishing process. So we solved her problem. Her book became an amazing success, and we realized the world was full of these people–<em>smart people who should write a book, but don’t, because the process is so painful. </em>These people want to write books, but don’t have the time or desire to do it the old way, and that’s why Scribe exists: <em>we help people turn their ideas into books that both cement their legacy and impact the world. </em>Our process has worked for over 1200 authors in five years, and we’re growing fast. Our ultimate goal is to <em>help everyone on earth write and publish a book. </em>If we do that, we’ll help create many thousands of books that would never have otherwise existed, changing the lives of millions of people. That’s really exciting to us.</p><p><strong>You In? Awesome, here’s the details:</strong></p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anywhere in the world. If we decide later to work together full-time, you must be based in or willing to relocate to Austin, Texas.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Type of Employment</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Freelance first, potentially moving to full-time.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Necessary Skills &amp; Qualifications:</strong></p><p>Here is the list of skills we believe are necessary for this job. Most importantly, we are hiring based on careful balance of relevant experience, cultural fit, and motivation:</p><ul><li><u>Extensive Design Skills:</u> We are more concerned about your design skills than your resume. If your portfolio is good, we’re willing to give you a try, regardless of experience or credentials.</li><li><u>You Are Organized &amp; Task Oriented:</u> This is not a job for something who is sloppy with details. You will be juggling multiple design projects at once, and you’ll have to be able to get things done and keep up with your projects.</li><li><u>You Are Self-Motivated And Get Shit Done:</u> We don’t want someone who has to be constantly managed. If you only work well with someone telling you what to do, DO NOT APPLY. You must be very self-motivated. There are no lifestyle roles here. We all work very hard every day, because we care about our mission, and what we do matters to us and other people. Authors rely on you. [NOTE: Hard work does not mean endless hours. It only means results. There is no coasting and no hiding here and you will be held accountable for achieving real results. If that doesn’t excite you, this is the wrong tribe for you.]</li></ul><p><strong>Pay &amp; Perks:</strong></p><ul><li><u>Competitive Pay:</u> $1500 per cover freelance (for paperback + ebook covers; bonus pay for hardcover and/or audiobook versions)</li><li><u>Be Connected To A Tribe:</u> You (should) have seen the videos above. We also have a pretty cool set of principles that we live by as a Tribe, you should check it out, because this is the operating system for our tribe, and everyone in our company lives the values and principles outlined in this doc. We interact with our freelancers in the same way.</li><li><u>Make A Real Impact:</u> We’re a small tribe (still under 50 full time), and you will be a major part of the projects you work on. Not only that, you won’t just impact the company, you’ll impact the world. Books are one of the very best ways to influence other people and change the way they think–and you’ll be helping to make them a reality.</li><li><u>Work With Interesting People:</u> You’re not just working on any books. Past authors include major company CEOs, famous entrepreneurs, professional athletes, and people with amazing personal stories. These are books that change lives.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://scribe.breezy.hr/p/fa4de878b227-book-cover-designer' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Employees are encouraged to seek out conference opportunities to grow their skills and personal networks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Company Retreat:</strong>Once a year, we gather the entire company to spend quality time together away from our desks – usually somewhere quite beautiful.</li><li><strong>Streaming Music Subscription:</strong>Music is important to us; we provide a Spotify subscription (or equivalent) for all of our employees.</li><li><strong>Workflow:&nbsp;</strong>We firmly believe in a strong, consistent deployment workflow.

Why is this amazing? Because design is the killer app for crypto and the distributed web, and our mission is to improve humanity’s most important technology: the internet. We can’t do it without user-centered designers like you! We have a rare opportunity to research and build at the core of how the internet could work, and make its next version easier to use and more inclusive.</p>  <p><em>Tell us about how <em>you</em> work! You don’t need experience in 100% of these responsibilities, and we’d like to hear about your unique perspective on this role.</em></p>  <p><strong>Some challenges you could work on include:</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>What does identity verification look like in a decentralized system?</li>   <li>How do trust and trust systems manifest in systems where people are exchanging data, instead of relying on centralized systems, and how should we design for that?</li>   <li>Technologies and protocols like IPFS let you distribute identical copies of your data across a dynamic, scalable network of peers (instead of relying on a centralized cloud). How should a UI communicate to users what ‘sharing on the internet’ means in the future? How could systems support stewarding data together in such a system?</li>   <li>What does a UI kit look like for distributed web apps, and what changes (if any) should we make for the different ways people might interact with the distributed web?</li>   <li>We have to talk about this brave new world in ways that humans can understand. How should we build those instructional and communication touchpoints, from websites to tutorials to API docs to GitHub repos?</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Zoom in and out. Generate high-level product strategies as well as the practical project steps to get there.</li>   <li>Lead projects from a user experience design perspective using techniques such as design studios, workshops (both in-person and remote), user journeys, and service blueprints.</li>   <li>Support collaborative decision-making. Tell compelling, research-driven stories to illustrate pros and cons of various options.</li>   <li>Show persistent commitment to thoughtful, inclusive, and ethical user research.</li>   <li>Deliver whatever’s needed to guide development — this could include wireframes, sitemaps, flowcharts, storyboards, or user stories.</li>   <li>Create written materials and visual presentations that are accessible to non-experts but that are legally and technically accurate.</li>   <li>Incorporate UX into agile development sprints, coordinating with visual and content designers, developers, and product managers to achieve a strategic vision.</li>   <li>Show your process transparently in open source communities such as GitHub, or have an interest in learning how to do this.</li>   <li>Lead user research and usability testing</li>   <li>Plan and facilitate user interviews</li>   <li>Prioritize research projects based on team needs and goals</li>   <li>Plan and facilitate collaboration between researchers and team members</li>   <li>Plan strategies for outreach to find feedback participants</li>   <li>Provide mentorship and guidance to other user experience designers, or people interested in UX techniques, on the team.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Excellent community-facing and internal communication skills</li>   <li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills</li>   <li>Demonstrated expertise leading design work with cross-functional, iterative teams on time-sensitive projects</li>   <li>Demonstrated experience in design research (both generative and evaluative)</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Experience in at least one other design discipline such as front end design, information architecture, interaction design, visual design, or service design.</li>   <li>Experience working in collaborative, open environments (such as open source communities).</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>What’s it like to work at Protocol Labs?</strong><br>Protocol Labs mission is to improve humanity’s most important technology, the Internet.

    "content": "About us<br /><br />Disperse is a VC-backed artificial intelligence construction startup focused on improving on-site productivity with the help of computer vision. Our goal is to ultimately re-imagine the way building projects are planned, delivered and operated.<br /><br />We're currently working on some of the largest building projects in London (e.g. Renzo Piano’s Shard Place, Wood Wharf) and have grown from 5 to 35 people over the past year. We have ambitions to expand significantly, which means that we are looking for passionate and enthusiastic talent to join the team.<br /><br />We move at a high speed, and will provide you with immense opportunities for initiative, creativity and leadership. Our proudly diverse, international team is based in London, Sarajevo and Yerevan, and has a wealth of experience from construction management to computer vision and robotics.<br /><br /><br />Your role<br /><br />We are looking for an entrepreneurial UX designer with a passion for great products and digital technologies. There is no better time to join our growing team, as you will have the rare opportunity to establish yourself as our first design leader, as you find, onboard and mentor the next generation of Disperse designers across our international offices. Our ideal team member is ready to take on both business growth and design challenges, and is excited to creatively embed design into artificial intelligence-based solutions to solve the age old productivity gap in the construction industry.<br /><br />Not only will you have a lead role in growing our design function, but you will also be a core member of our growing Product team, collaborating closely with our product managers and engineers right from product inception and discovery through to delivery. Your key responsibilities will include:<br /><br />Building, leading and mentoring a team of talented UI and UX designers and freelancers.<br />Owning our UX product design streams, and prototyping your way to validated, delightfully simple experiences for our customers.<br />Envisioning and implementing an industry-defining customer experience across all touchpoints - both on and off of our platform.<br />Developing a deep understanding of our customers’ workflows and pain points, through conducting user research, user testing, and running workshops.<br />Partnering with our awesome product managers and engineers to collaboratively design and deliver solutions that will transcend an entire industry.<br />Leading the definition, development and operation of our Design System and language.<br />Fostering our human-centred design culture across the entire business, and sharing your deep domain knowledge with everyone on the team.<br /><br />Our culture<br /><br />Ask anyone at Disperse what they love most about working here, and they'll probably tell you &quot;it's the people!&quot;, &quot;the team, of course&quot;, &quot;the people and the Hedwig owls in the offices&quot;.<br /><br />As clichéd as it may sound, we're very proud of the people we have and the close-knit, family culture we've built across London, Sarajevo and Yerevan. Despite the distances, we're united through the passion with which we approach our goals and the fun that we have along the way. We always look out for each other, no matter what. The following should give you a good idea what type of culture you'd be joining:<br /><br />We encourage proactivity and taking full ownership of problems and initiatives. We don't believe in micromanagement. Instead, we let you pave your own path and give you the space to continuously learn and grow even if it means taking a few detours.<br />We support each other. If a process breaks or if you're struggling, you can always count on the people around you and the people far away from you, to help you get back on track.<br />We run on feedback: direct and transparent praise and constructive criticism, communicated with the best of intentions. There is no other way to learn!<br />Ideas and approaches are always judged on merit rather than source. We welcome discussions and challenges. This way everyone makes a tremendous impact no matter the role.<br /><br />REQUIREMENTS<br /><br />You should apply if:<br /><br />You have an insatiable passion for UX design and its latest trends, and a keen interest in disruptive technologies.<br />You own a portfolio that can take us on a design user journey for at least two extensive digital projects and can give us insight into your design process and decision-making skills.<br />You have 3+ years of work experience in a digital UX role.<br />You have excellent command of product design and prototyping tools, such as Sketch/Figma, InVision, Indesign/Illustrator/Photoshop.<br />You have proven experience in facilitating design workshops and managing both stakeholder and customer relationships.<br />You are well-versed in UX research methodologies including ethnographic research, user testing, usability testing and A/B testing.<br />You're eligible to work in the UK. No visa sponsorship is available for this position.<br /><br />Desirable but not essential:<br /><br />You have experience growing and leading design teams, and mentoring junior designers.<br /><br />BENEFITS<br /><br />Pro-rata salary of £50,000 - £70,000 per annum plus generous option package (depending on experience level).<br />Private health insurance.<br />25 days’ holiday plus all bank holidays.<br />Friendly, open and transparent culture.<br />You'll get to join a passionate startup with proven traction on its scaling journey.<br />Flexible working hours / ability to work from home.<br />Awesome startup office in Central London, Fitzrovia.<br />Free coffee.<br />Regular socials, and team retreats to amazing destinations (Tbilisi, Sarajevo... Where next?)<br /><br />Disperse welcomes applications from all sections of society. We are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, religion or belief, ethnic or national origin, disability, age, citizenship, marital, domestic or civil partnership status, sexual orientation, gender identity or any other basis as protected by applicable law. If you have a disability or additional need that requires accommodation, please do not hesitate to let us know.<br /><br /><br />The process<br />The interview process will involve:<br /><br />1-hour on-site portfolio walkthrough and cultural chat;<br />Design case study for us to get a sense of how you tackle problems - completed in your own time;<br />2-hour on-site interview: presentation of case study with Q&A, followed by technical and cultural chats with different members of the team.<br />This process should take up to two weeks, depending on diaries.

Are you comfortable doing high-level conceptual explorations one day and ‘perfecting pixels’ the next?</p><p>Help us help the UX teams at the largest e-commerce sites in the world.</p><p>We’re looking for a UI web designer to be the primary person responsible for the designs of baymard.com and Baymard Premium, our research subscription service.</p><p>You’ll essentially be responsible for the interface design of Baymard’s end-user experience — making our research a pleasure to use for the thousands of web professionals that rely on it, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.</p><p><strong><em>This is a remote full-time position.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Examples of What You’ll Be Doing</strong></p><p>Two examples of the types of interfaces you’ll be working on designing and improving over time.</p><p>Below are some concrete examples of what typical design tasks would look like:</p><ul><li>Web UI design. You’ll deep-dive on creating perfected and harmonic UIs for Baymard’s key pages and website elements. That could be improving the aesthetics of pages such as the Case Studies, Annotated Screenshots, Homepage, etc.</li><li>Extensive visual explorations of new features. Often you’ll be given a project brief for an upcoming feature, and will then be working on exploring the full solution space of possible UIs. A brief could be something like:&nbsp;<em>“Explore a series of concrete design concepts for a new element to be added to our case study pages that highlights the 10 most interesting examples from the reviewed website.”</em>.</li><li>Optimize the designs of text-heavy pages. As many of our key pages contain long texts (by web standards, at least) — including our Audit Service, Product Page, Research Articles, etc. — even small incremental gains in the reading experience have a dramatic impact on our overall UX.</li><li>Create interactive mockups. You’ll sometimes make interactive versions of the final design so our team of UX researchers can play around with it and get a crystal clear idea of what the final feature would feel like. These interactive mockups will furthermore serve as a “design spec” for our developers.</li><li>Quality assure the implemented versions of your design. Following your designs all the way from early idea through final implementation, reviewing and communicating to our developers what needs to be tweaked in order to realize the design’s vision and objectives.</li></ul><p>If you enjoy such challenges, you’ll be the perfect candidate.</p><p><strong>About Your Job at Baymard</strong></p><p>Your job will be building out and refining the UI of Baymard’s web platform.</p><p>At Baymard you’ll be working alongside a team of dedicated usability researchers that conduct cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Amazon, Home Depot, Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc). Your job will be creating the designs for new features and refining the existing designs of Baymard’s web platform.</p><ul><li>Work – Your primary responsibility will be exploring, evolving, and polishing the UI designs of Baymard’s web platform called Baymard Premium (this is the “delivery vehicle” for all of our research work). You’ll be working closely with the founders of Baymard and our small in-house developer team. You’ll often be starting with already identified project goals, user needs, and overarching concepts for solutions, and then yourself: explore the full ‘solution space’, detail the UI components, present your work to the team, revise your designs based on their feedback, build interactive prototypes, polish the aesthetics, then polish the aesthetics some more, and lastly, ensure that when the final feature is developed it matches the vision of your work and our project.</li><li>Team – Most of Baymard’s 15-people team are UX researchers. While our research teams know everything about user behavior, they don’t create new designs themselves. You will therefore be the “owner” of Baymard’s designs, and must therefore take joy in leading the design efforts of baymard.com, our internal tools, and most importantly Baymard Premium (our research subscription service).</li><li><strong>Remote – We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which 90% of our employees do).

This means zero management layers between you and final decision. You’ll have direct access to and impact on decision making.</li><li><strong>Lots of responsibility</strong> – From day 1 (OK, maybe day 2) you will be working on final products or services. We believe the best way to learn is to work an actual products and challenges, supplemented with rich ‘early feedback’.</li><li><strong>Long-term focus</strong> – Decisions are always based on their long term impact. We’re not interested in hunting after the next “quick win” — we want to make a lasting impact on the e-commerce industry and usually adopt a 5-year perspective in our decisions and projects.</li><li><strong>Remote from the ground up</strong> – 90% of the team works remotely. We’ve deliberately designed the organization around remote work. That said, we do bring the entire team together for a week once a year somewhere interesting in the world. (In past meetups we snowmobiled glaciers on Iceland, went to NYC, etc.)</li><li><strong>Team of ‘subject matter’ nerds</strong> – Everyone geeks out a bit on their work interests. We love that, and once a week someone from the team does a 20min presentation on their latest obsession — whether it’s quasi-quantum-worlds or the proper usage of hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes.</li><li><strong>Founders engaged in the product</strong> – We believe it is essential that those orchestrating the work of the organization are keenly in tune with all aspects of it. The two founders of Baymard have therefore performed every type of task in the organization themselves (from programming to UX testing), and continue to work directly on the product.</li></ul><p>Do your values match those?

This means zero management layers between you and final decision. You’ll have direct access to and impact on decision making.</li><li><strong>Lots of responsibility</strong> – From day 1 (OK, maybe day 2) you will be working on final products or services. We believe the best way to learn is to work an actual products and challenges, supplemented with rich ‘early feedback’.</li><li><strong>Long-term focus</strong> – Decisions are always based on their long term impact. We’re not interested in hunting after the next “quick win” — we want to make a lasting impact on the e-commerce industry and usually adopt a 5-year perspective in our decisions and projects.</li><li><strong>Remote from the ground up</strong> – 90% of the team works remotely. We’ve deliberately designed the organization around remote work. That said, we do bring the entire team together for a week once a year somewhere interesting in the world. (In past meetups we snowmobiled glaciers on Iceland, went to NYC, etc.)</li><li><strong>Team of ‘subject matter’ nerds</strong> – Everyone geeks out a bit on their work interests. We love that, and once a week someone from the team does a 20min presentation on their latest obsession — whether it’s quasi-quantum-worlds or the proper usage of hyphens, en dashes, and em dashes.</li><li><strong>Founders engaged in the product</strong> – We believe it is essential that those orchestrating the work of the organization are keenly in tune with all aspects of it. The two founders of Baymard have therefore performed every type of task in the organization themselves (from programming to UX testing), and continue to work directly on the product.</li></ul><p>Do your values match those?

Are you comfortable doing high-level conceptual explorations one day and ‘perfecting pixels’ the next?</i></div><div><br></div><div>We’re looking for a UI web designer to be the primary person responsible for the designs of baymard.com and Baymard Premium, our research subscription service.</div><div><br></div><div>You’ll essentially be responsible for the interface design of Baymard’s end-user experience — making our research a pleasure to use for the thousands of web professionals that rely on it, all the way from the independent freelance web designer to the UX Director of a Fortune 500 company.</div><div><br></div><div><i>This is a remote full-time position.</i></div><div><br></div><div>Read a well-formatted version of this job posting on our website:</div><div>https://baymard.com/jobs/designer</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><b>Examples of What You'll Be Doing</b></div><div><br></div><div>Below are some concrete examples of what typical design tasks would look like:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Web UI design</b> — You’ll deep-dive on creating perfected and harmonic UIs for Baymard’s key pages and website elements. That could be improving the aesthetics of pages such as the Case Studies (http://bit.ly/2X4lukY), Annotated Screenshots (http://bit.ly/2KjvwbZ), Homepage (http://bit.ly/2WDN1p9), etc.</li><li><b>Extensive visual explorations of new features</b> — Often you’ll be given a project brief for an upcoming feature, and will then be working on exploring the full solution space of possible UIs. A brief could be something like: <i>“Explore a series of concrete design concepts for a new element to be added to our case study pages (http://bit.ly/2X4lukY)&nbsp;that highlights the 10 most interesting examples from the reviewed website.”</i></li><li><b>Optimize the designs of text-heavy pages</b> — As many of our key pages contain long texts (by web standards, at least) — including our Audit Service (http://bit.ly/2WI8OAG), Product Page (http://bit.ly/2IeAi8r), Research Articles (http://bit.ly/2F2ahHp), etc. — even small incremental gains in the reading experience have a dramatic impact on our overall UX.</li><li><b>Create interactive mockups</b> — You’ll sometimes make interactive versions of the final design so our team of UX researchers can play around with it and get a crystal clear idea of what the final feature would feel like. These interactive mockups will furthermore serve as a “design spec” for our developers.</li><li><b>Quality assure the implemented versions of your design</b> — Following your designs all the way from early idea through final implementation, reviewing and communicating to our developers what needs to be tweaked in order to realize the design’s vision and objectives.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>If you enjoy such challenges, you’ll be the perfect candidate.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>About Your Job at Baymard</b></div><div><br></div><div>At Baymard you’ll be working alongside a team of dedicated usability researchers that conduct cutting-edge e-commerce research used by UX teams at some of the biggest brands in the world (clients include Amazon, Home Depot, Nike, Lenovo, Etsy, etc). Your job will be creating the designs for new features and refining the existing designs of Baymard’s web platform.</div><div><br></div><ul><li><b>Work</b><span> – Your primary responsibility will be exploring, evolving, and polishing the UI designs of Baymard’s web platform called Baymard Premium (this is the “delivery vehicle” for all of our research work). You’ll be working closely with the founders of Baymard and our small in-house developer team. You’ll often be starting with already identified project goals, user needs, and overarching concepts for solutions, and then yourself: explore the full ‘solution space’, detail the UI components, present your work to the team, revise your designs based on their feedback, build interactive prototypes, polish the aesthetics, then polish the aesthetics some more, and lastly, ensure that when the final feature is developed it matches the vision of your work and our project.</span></li><li><b>Team</b><span> – Most of Baymard’s 15-people team are UX researchers. While our research teams know everything about user behavior, they don’t create new designs themselves. You will therefore be the “owner” of Baymard’s designs, and must therefore take joy in leading the design efforts of baymard.com, our internal tools, and most importantly Baymard Premium (our research subscription service).</span></li><li><b>Remote</b><span> – We want to work with the smartest and most dedicated people around the world, and all of our positions are therefore open to full-time remote work. In other words, you are welcome to work with us from any location you prefer (which 90% of our employees do).

    "content": "<span><h2>Visual Designer&nbsp;</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>Ghost</h3></span> <span>Worldwide</span> <span></span> <span>verified</span> <div>  <div>   As the company grows, we're looking to expand our design team and improve everything about the Ghost brand and how it's represented to our users and customers. We care, deeply, about great design and experience — at the expense of most other things. Design work has a very strong voice here.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>This is a broad role which is about leading design in lots of different areas, primarily around all of our brand, marketing, website, and just about every property that our users will come into contact with.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>All of Ghost's design was initially done by our Founder/CEO - John, and today our design is led by Zimo - who spends the majority of his time deeply focused on our product. You'll be the 3rd member of the Ghost design team, so you'll have a massive amount of opportunity to influence design across the entire organisation.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We're looking for a visual designer with a deep understanding of marketing, branding, and user communication — and who cares deeply about quality, and helping to create (+evolve) a refined, beautiful style.   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> ⚡️ Working with design and marketing leadership to define, evolve, and maintain Ghost's brand identity across all marketing and product touch points.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br> Creation of websites, landing pages, diagrams, illustrations, stickers, tshirts, checkout flows, billing management. You'll lead all of our most public facing properties and brand assets. The visual voice of the company.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br> You'll work with the marketing/business team on projects which are directly related to growing the business and creating user-facing content.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br> Designers at Ghost work on different cross-functional teams, there's still plenty of collaboration and feedback between teammates to help and support each other throughout various projects.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br> Lots of freedom to take control of your process, iterating and learning what works (and what doesn't), and putting your work into production. There's a lot of opportunity for professional growth here, as the team expands.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br> Communicating effectively with stakeholders when presenting your work and clearly articulating your design rationale   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>⚖️ Managing multiple projects, while setting appropriate expectations and meeting realistic deadlines   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>* An underdog. We aren't hiring flashy designers from Fortune 500's here, we're looking for real human people who like to do great work. If you don't think you're good enough for this role, then you're probably exactly who we'd like to join the team. Please do apply!   <br>   <br>* Fiercely independent. All teams at Ghost operate fairly autonomously, and all team members are responsible for helping make decisions about what needs to be done. You'll need to be comfortable ideating, prototyping, testing and delivering designs without someone standing over your shoulder telling you what to do.   <br>   <br>* Meticulous about style. Despite frequent character assassination amongst UX professionals, aesthetic style matters a great deal. We don't A/B test 50 shades of blue here to determine what converts best, we care about making beautiful things which we love.   <br>   <br>* Humble but opinionated. We like smart people who have lots of ideas, yet are happy to discard their former opinions whenever a better way of doing things presents itself.   <br>   <br>* A clear communicator. Good design is good communication, and as a remote team which communicates almost exclusively through writing — concise, written communication is absolutely essential to this role.   <br>   <br>* An active collaborator. We look for people who actively want critical feedback on their work early and often, and who get a kick out of refining and pushing what they do as a collaborative process because it creates a better end result. No design heroes.   <br>   <br>* Comfortable with code. Ghost is a software company, and everyone here codes in one way or another. You don't need to be an expert, but you do need to be actively open to learning and working with code to do design.   <br>   <br>* Hungry for meaningful work, and space to do it. Almost all work at Ghost is complex and extremely challenging - but also deeply rewarding. We're not in the slightest bit fucking interested in what Design-Twitter thinks about... well, anything at all really. We're aggressively uncool.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>This role would be particularly suited to someone with a background as a freelancer or at an agency, who is looking for more, that they aren't getting from doing client work. This is a role where you can help influence design over the long term, not just fulfil a temporary brief which needs to be delivered quickly.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We don't mind where you're based or what hours you work, but this role does require reasonable working-hours overlap with the rest of our product/marketing teams in Europe.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>We value diversity of all types at Ghost and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We have as many people who speak German as we do English and our engineering team contains as many women as it does men. Some of us are single, others are married, while others are parents. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

People would have a path to a fulfilling future, instead of being buried under debt. Employers would benefit from a workforce trained for today. And education could finally offer students a return on their investment of both money and time.&nbsp; We put in outlandish amounts of effort to create an education that offers our students a guaranteed return on their investment. we partner with employers to create a world-class curriculum built for today. We go to ends of the earth to find mentors who are the best of the best. We invest more in career services than any of our peers. We work hard to be on the ground in the cities our students are. Simply put, no other school works as hard for its students as we do.&nbsp; Students enroll in Thinkful courses to gain the valuable technical and professional skills needed to take them from curious learners to employed technologists. As a Design Course Mentor, you will support students by acting as an advisor, counselor, and support system as they complete the course and land their first industry job. To achieve this, you will engage with students using the below range of approaches, known as Engagement Formats.
