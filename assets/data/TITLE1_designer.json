They would have a strong desire to straddle our design and engineering teams, providing the glue needed to build beautiful and useful web applications. They would also be eager to learn, grow, and foster healthy working relationships.<br><br>If you have experience building production web applications and are as passionate about helping customers as you are about working with new technologies, then we want to talk!<br><strong><br>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></div><div><br><strong>Do you love to work directly with customers to solve business problems?<br></strong><br></div><div>We believe great software is discovered by understanding the core problems our clients are facing – and that is best achieved through frequent and direct communication with the subject matter experts. We provide leadership to support and guide interactions, but we need you to be comfortable talking with clients, discussing problems, and proposing solutions, which may not always be more software.<br><br></div><div><strong>Do you have experience creating production web applications?</strong><br><br></div><div>We strive to support our team's growth, learning, and taking on new roles at the edge of our comfort zones. At the same time, our clients expect us to bring a certain level of expertise. If you have never worked on a production web application, it is unlikely you will succeed here, even if you have other types of engineering experience.<br><br><strong>Extensive production knowledge of HTML/CSS</strong></div><div><br>You'll be mostly building web applications, so you'll need to be familiar with your tools, and have used your tools on a number of production web applications.<br><br><strong>Experience with Design, UI and, prototyping tools</strong><br><br>Comfortable using tools like Sketch, Adobe Suite, inVision, Zeplin, or Figma.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Are you able to work remotely, within +/- 2 hours of US Eastern time zone?<br></strong><br></div><div>We all mostly work from home. This requires the ability to self-direct and communicate well in writing. It also offers tremendous freedom and power, which comes with, uh, tremendous responsibility. We currently require our team to be within a 2hr time zone difference of Richmond, VA and physically based in the United States. Exceptions can be made if you're willing to work east coast business hours.<br><br></div><div><strong>Bonus Points</strong><br><br></div><ul><li><strong>Being within easy driving distance of Richmond or Charlottesville is a huge plus!</strong></li><li>Bonus for having some JavaScript experience, and being able to work within frontend frameworks like React or Vue.</li><li>Bonus for having user experience skills.<br><br></li></ul><div><strong>What We Offer</strong></div><ul><li>A Great Team - Our team of engineers and designers is the best part of working here. We only hire people who are fantastic teammates – competent and smart, sure, but also humble, positive, and generous.</li><li>Great Clients - We work with mostly small and medium clients, for whom our projects make a huge impact. We prioritize clients who are pleasant and good to work with, people who share our values of transparency and empathy.</li><li>Work From Home - We are a distributed company. Everyone works from home, though the leadership team all live in central Virginia.</li><li>Negligible Travel - In general, we don't travel routinely for projects. If this is a specific concern, we're happy to discuss.</li><li>Flexible Work Schedule - We require a certain amount of overlap with the rest of the team, but if you have a predictable schedule, we can probably support it, e.g., ending at 3:30 every day or being out every Friday morning.</li><li>Good Work Life Balance (really) - We ask our team to work 40 hours a week*. That's all: a good, productive 40 hours. And then we try our best to leave you alone off the clock. We do this in part because that's how we want to live but also because we want our team to be recharged and ready to do their best when working. *If you need to work fewer than 40 hours, that might be possible too; let’s talk.</li><li>Competitive Compensation - We offer highly competitive salary and benefits, including generous time off, 401k, FSA, medical and dental insurance.</li></ul></div>",

As a design intern, you will develop interactive wireframes, take part in user research calls and develop (on brand) visual assets for our product and landing pages. You&rsquo;ll also gain experience working with engineers, senior stakeholders and clients.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>In addition to your regular product design tasks, we will co-create a business-critical project with you.

Please note that&nbsp;<strong>this is an unpaid internship</strong>, but we can offer a basic allowance on lunch expenses.&nbsp;</p><br /><h4>Eligibility</h4><br /><p>As this is an unpaid role, we can only accept applications from students (in a relevant degree) looking for work experience.

Your thoughtfulness extends to your team, and you consider who will inherit your assets when you make them.</li><br /><li>Continuously Learning: You are passionate about learning and care deeply about broadening your horizons and developing yourself. When it comes to design, you enjoy wearing multiple hats</li><br /><li>A Deep Diver: You pay attention to the details and are skeptical about outcomes unless metrics tell us otherwise.</li><br /></ul><br /><h4>You have</h4><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience with high-fidelity prototyping tools such as Sketch, Adobe XD, or similar</li><br /><li>A passion for great design and a vision for making complex things simple.</li><br /><li>A modest portfolio of work that you can share with us as part of your application.&nbsp;</li><br /><li>Bonus: If you have interest in (or previous experience of) coding and/or video-editing, please let us know in your cover letter.&nbsp;</li><br /></ul>",

If you have any experience with that, it's a major plus</p><br /><p>## Company Culture</p><br /><p>As one of our early hires, your work will have a massive impact on the direction of the company. We are looking for someone who is able to work in a team and also independently.</p><br /><p>It&rsquo;s very important for us to get along with our colleagues and regardless of your location (office or remote), we want someone who is involved with us for more than just work and that is happy to bond over the occasional night out or team retreat.</p><br /><p>Due to the nature of our small team, there will be times where work will need to be carried out at unusual times (e.g. production migrations, calls with clients in different time zones), and we expect you to be happy to stick around a bit longer when necessary.</p><br /><p>That being said, we aim to offer a great level of work/life balance and don&rsquo;t look for you to work more than 15-25 hours a week (dependent on what we agree), and in turn, we expect great quality work and self-motivation.</p><br /><p>Our individual growth matters as much as the business outcomes.

Dabei kommt es vor allen Dingen darauf an, dass du den Nutzer im Blick behältst, dass du sagst, welche Informationen wo zusammenfließen sollen, wie man die Wege kurz hält und die Informationen strukturiert darstellt.</p><p>Du solltest mehrere Jahre Erfahrung in der Entwicklung mit Angular haben, gut mit HTML und SCSS umgehen können und sicher darin sein, einfache Events mit TypeScript zu handlen. Komplexere Berechnungen und das Zusammenziehen der Informationen erledigt das Backend, so dass du dich aufs Design (auch für Mobile Devices) und die UserExperience konzentrieren kannst.</p><p>Dafür ist es auch nötig, eng mit Externen und anderen Firmenmitgliedern außerhalb der Entwicklung zusammenzuarbeiten, so dass du Deutsch auf Niveau C2 beherrschen musst. Entwicklungsintern sprechen wir viel Englisch, dafür genügt aber Niveau B2.</p><p>Wir haben für den Start ein Webshop-Template gekauft und bereits Internationalisierung mit i18n eingebaut. Jetzt brauchen wir dich – bewirb dich mit einigen deiner bisherigen Projekte – zeig uns, was du magst und worauf du stolz bist.
