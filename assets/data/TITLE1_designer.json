Whether it’s with customers, employees, or a target market, SurveyMonkey helps curious individuals and companies — including 99% of the Fortune 500 — have conversations at scale with the people who matter most. It’s People Powered Data that allows them to understand not only “what” is happening, but “why.” SurveyMonkey’s 700+ employees throughout North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are dedicated to powering the curious.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</strong></span></p><p>SurveyMonkey is the world’s most popular survey platform. While it is a great general-purpose tool used by millions, there is ample opportunity for more specialized solutions. That’s where we come in. We build standalone, targeted SaaS products that bring great UX to solving more specific business problems.</p><p>To date, our 12-person team has shipped three products:</p><ul><li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a> - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a> - Understand and foster employee engagement</li><li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a> - Source and publish 3rd-party verified customer proof</li></ul><p>We’re on a mission to bring better design to the business world, and while we’re at it we’d like to make our mark with stunning data viz, personable interfaces, and a commitment to empathizing with our users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></span></p><p>We’re looking for a talented designer with demonstrable experience working on user-friendly SaaS applications. Your portfolio should demonstrate the ability to design for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop. You should also be comfortable writing clear, concise UI copy.</p><p>Strong visual design, product design, usability, and communication skills are essential. Technical skills such as CSS, Javascript, and familiarity with Ruby on Rails are also a strong plus, though not required. Experience contributing to a central design system is a major plus and you will have opportunity to participate as we evolve ours.</p><p>If you’re jazzed about making really complex things super simple we should talk. If you’re interested in creating the future of intuitive data visualization (and have an opinion on what that means) we should talk. If you believe that great design belongs everywhere and have the mettle to make it happen, we should <em>definitely</em> talk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Qualifications</strong></span></p><ul><li>3+ years of experience on a product design team working across the entire product development lifecycle and successfully shipping products.</li><li>Experience working effectively with cross-functional teams including shepherding designs through the development process.</li><li>Experience collaborating with other designers to create a cohesive cross-product experience, both leveraging and contributing to a centralized design system.</li><li>Solid user-centered design fundamentals with information architecture, interaction design and visual design skills and the ability to quickly produce high quality deliverables across the range of disciplines.</li><li>Demonstrated ability to write clear, effective UI copy.</li><li>Ability to present design solutions at all levels of the organization with clear, articulate rationale.</li><li>Proficient with Sketch, Invision, Creative Suite, and knowledgeable about HTML, CSS, modern browser technologies, and cross-device design.</li><li>Portfolio showcasing examples of product design work.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Why Work Here?</strong></span></p><p>We are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific timezone by at least four hours, where you live and work and up to you. We’re not strangers though -- in addition to a sane amount of video calls, we meet up quarterly to get to know each other better and have some fun. In the past year, we've been bowling in Phoenix, made sushi in San Francisco, and toured a brewery.</p><p>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. As such, you will be expected to be a manager of one.</p><p>Naturally, we offer competitive salaries and annual bonuses, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and meaningful equity compensation. We also supply you with top of the line equipment for your home office.</p><p>Finally, in a world of clunky “enterprise” software, we consider great UX and visual design to be a strategic advantage, and we need you to help us keep improving. Our track record gives our team a lot of autonomy -- this is your chance to rethink how “business solutions” should look and function, and to have fun while doing it.</p><p>Join us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At SurveyMonkey, we offer competitive salaries, medical/dental benefits, PTO, 401k, paid holidays and parental leave, and equity compensation.</p><p>SurveyMonkey is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>"

The company's vision is to create effectively a creators guild, an environment where pure, unrestrained creativity can thrive without the taint of profit motive or outside pressure - a concept they call the &quot;Autodidactic Islands.&quot;</div><div></div><div>The current team consists of primarily self-taught individuals each deeply skilled in multiple fields and disciplines. As such, we are constantly looking for others like ourselves who are equally inventors, creators, and artists at heart to join us in the vision behind the company. We believe the kind of projects we take on require the curiosity, hunger, and worldliness that only come from being genuinely interested in both programming and finance, math and literature, art and science, polymath and autodidact.

A typical day can go from trading cryptocurrencies and building AIs to acting an impromptu skit and composing soundtracks by ear. There is no room to dabble or tag along. We are not looking for &quot;masters of none.&quot; This is not an entry level position and not a specialized role. This is not an artist support group and not an accelerator or incubator to seed ideas. We are not here to save anyone, nor are we interested in anyone wanting to save the world. This is a team for those crazy and curious enough to build rockets to Mars or fuse with AI for immortality. This is a ship for those wanting to see how far they can go and not just how long they can survive. We've built an engine that lets us tackle any project we can think of, pursue any idea we can dream of, and we’re looking for others who can take it even further, others who, like us, have a strong sense of adventure, a healthy level of insanity, and a genuine desire to take over the world... just because we can!

We currently do this by giving regulated businesses the tools they need to automate and digitalise the onboarding, verification and management of their customers - that means customers can be onboarded in real-time, without ever having met in person. <br /><br />And this is just the beginning - our technology allows us to define what ‘trust’ means across the digital economy. Our long term aim is to create a single network where people and businesses can share their digital identity securely and interchangeably - whether they’re applying for a mortgage, listing on the stock market, or applying for a new job. We're transforming how trust is established online, in the same way that Salesforce transformed sales, Stripe transformed payments and AWS transformed DevOps.<br /><br />What you’ll be doing<br /><br />You’ll work with our Lead Designer to help solve complex user-software problems. You’ll be a voice for our users and their needs. An internal champion for exceptional product quality and the need for cohesive experiences.<br /><br />On a day-to-day basis you’ll be involved in all parts of the design process.

    "content": "<h2> Humbly Confident Visual Designer</h2><div>Worldwide</div><div>Company: You Need A Budget<p></p></div><div>FULL-TIME</div><div><h3>Overview</h3><p>YNAB makes friendly, high quality software that changes lives through effective budgeting. We’ve got an ecosystem of apps, live classes, and stellar support. Now we need our next visual designer to bring the same attention to detail to our branding, marketing, and educational materials.</p><p>You come to the table with some experience under your belt. You know how to expand and maintain meticulous brand guidelines. You catch color mismatches that are mere shades off, you bristle at poor kerning, and you know that good design is in the details. You love to draw, and can create masterpieces with the pen tool. You also love to dream and get that our dream is to build a brand that is fun, smart, and approachable.</p><h2><strong>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</strong></h2><ul><li>At least two years of experience working in marketing design.</li><li>Experience working within strict, existing brand guidelines.</li><li>Experience creating vector illustrations.</li><li>Experience doing time-sensitive production work.</li><li>Experience designing for responsive web.</li><li>Ability to work and communicate effectively in a remote environment.</li><li>Your home base must be located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</li></ul><h2><strong>A Bit About Us</strong></h2><p>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: ourhas to really&nbsp;<em>click</em>&nbsp;with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</p><p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><h2><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></h2><p><strong>Todd,&nbsp;</strong>our Chief Strategy Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and experiences our users have in them—and knows that process begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;</strong>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</p><p><strong>Lindsey</strong>, our Chief Marketing Officer, is in charge of getting the word out about YNAB, and always finds a fun way to do that. Like our&nbsp;, where-in she wrote and re-recorded budgeting-related lyrics to pop-songs. (We suggest reading the rest of this description while listening to that album.)</p><p><strong>Lauren&nbsp;</strong>is our illustrator/designer. She is single-handedly responsible for almost all of the illustrations you see on our blog/Facebook/Instagram posts, and might be single-handedly responsible for all of the WoW achievement points mentioned on our&nbsp;. We should also mention that she designed and illustrated that page. So yeah, her list of awesome just keeps going and going. Oh, and she writes fantasy novels. Seriously.</p><h2><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></h2><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><h4><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></h4><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work pretty much wherever you want (for this particular opening, there are some time-zone requirements). Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><h4><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></h4><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><h4><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></h4><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a&nbsp;<em>minimum</em>&nbsp;vacation policy of three weeks per year. Something closer to five is about right. Plus we take two extra weeks for a Holiday break. It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><h4><strong>The YNAB Meetup</strong></h4><p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done, a&nbsp;&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch in Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</p><h4><strong>Up Your Game</strong></h4><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). We have a monthly book budget, send people to conferences, give dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing.</p><h4><strong>International is Absolutely Okay</strong></h4><p>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. We are spread all over the world,&nbsp;but for this particular position, we have a strong preference for candidates located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</p><h4><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></h4><p>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you&nbsp;<em>and your family.</em>&nbsp;(No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not&nbsp;<em>your retirement</em>&nbsp;<em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Why then, did you muddle through all of that awesomeness?)</p><h2><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></h2><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;<em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you.&nbsp;You will play a big, big part in helping the YNAB brand come to life and reach wider audiences.&nbsp;I’ll only say that six more times.</p><h2><strong>Now, back to you, our new Visual Designer…</strong></h2><p>As a visual designer at YNAB, you’ll live on&nbsp;<em>two&nbsp;</em>teams. You’ll be a prized resource for our marketing team, churning out ads, landing pages, and illustrations while maintaining the YNAB brand. As a member of the design team you’ll work alongside both UI/UX designers and visual designers to consistently improve the quality of visual design across the YNAB ecosystem. You will be our boots on the ground, protecting our brand with your pixel-perfect attention to detail.</p><h3><strong>What Success Looks Like:</strong></h3><p>The marketing team marvels at your ability to think big and execute quickly on the smallest of tasks. You roll up your sleeves and deliver what’s needed, sometimes before the marketing team asks for it. Other designers can’t stop praising you for your museum-worthy artwork and strict approach to file management. You’ll probably make our CEO cry from time to time. Our campaigns are so beautiful he can barely look at them without bringing out a tissue. You also make us laugh. We like to laugh.</p><p>You take direction from multiple teams, and communicate freely. You understand that great communication and time management is critical to your success in a remote work environment. When you say it will be done, it will be done. Your teammates don’t even have to think about it.</p><p>You know a great designer loves the very smallest parts of the job. Some call it pixel pushing. Others call it production work. We call it craft. You love tweaking your designs in the browser and communicate easily with developers, including in HTML and CSS. Because that’s how it’s done.</p><p>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem-solving for both creative and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to (devour, really) ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our company: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.</p><h3><strong>Bonus Points:</strong></h3><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB.</li><li>You have experience with animation and/or know how to prepare artwork for rigging.</li></ul><h2><strong>How to Apply</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Apply below by 11:59pm on August 19th, 2018.&nbsp;</strong>It’s a firm deadline.</li><li>Attach a PDF of your cover letter. In your cover letter:<ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.</li><li>We love a designer with a perspective. What’s yours? Feel free to touch on your beliefs on how design should be done, what it’s used for, or why it’s important.</li></ul></li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for.</li><li>Please include a portfolio that contains the following (if you are linking to an online portfolio, be sure to include the details below in your cover letter):<ul><li>Examples of design work.</li><li>Your design process (wireframes, interviews, sketches).</li><li>Links to any live work.</li><li>Please state the role you played on each project and specify if&nbsp;certain artwork used in a design was not created by you.</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>The Portfolio:</strong></h2><p>Note: We greatly appreciate receiving work as a personal portfolio website, Dropbox folder, or PDF.&nbsp;<strong>Please do not send a Behance or Dribbble link unless you cannot do otherwise.</strong></p><p>Include:</p><ul><li>Examples of marketing campaign content, landing pages, ads, and other assets.</li><li>Examples of vector artwork you have created.</li><li>Any style guides, brand documentation, or UI kits you have produced.</li><li>Examples of responsive web design.</li><li>Please include personal work only if LABELED AS SUCH. We prize real work with real stories over perfect spec work.</li></ul><p>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!</p><p><strong>The deadline for applications is 11:59PM on August 19th, 2018. Firm. It’s a real deadline, the kind you love.</strong></p><p></p><div> <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk01ovh' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a></div></div>"

We’ve got an ecosystem of apps, live classes, and stellar support. Now we need our next visual designer to bring the same attention to detail to our branding, marketing, and educational materials. </p><p>You come to the table with some experience under your belt. You know how to expand and maintain meticulous brand guidelines. You catch color mismatches that are mere shades off, you bristle at poor kerning, and you know that good design is in the details. You love to draw, and can create masterpieces with the pen tool. You also love to dream and get that our dream is to build a brand that is fun, smart, and approachable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</p><ul><li>At least two years of experience working in marketing design.</li><li>Experience working within strict, existing brand guidelines. </li><li>Experience creating vector illustrations.</li><li>Experience doing time-sensitive production work. </li><li>Experience designing for responsive web. </li><li>Ability to work and communicate effectively in a remote environment.</li><li>Your home base must be located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>A Bit About Us</h2><p>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'>Cultural Manifesto</a> has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you!</p><p>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p>Who you’d be working with:</p><p>Todd, our Chief Strategy Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and experiences our users have in them—and knows that process begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence and very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</p><p>Lindsey, our Chief Marketing Officer, is in charge of getting the word out about YNAB, and always finds a fun way to do that. Like our <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/ynab-mixtape-2017/' rel='nofollow'>YNAB mix-tape</a>, where-in she wrote and re-recorded budgeting-related lyrics to pop-songs. (We suggest reading the rest of this description while listening to that album.)</p><p>Lauren is our illustrator/designer. She is single-handedly responsible for almost all of the illustrations you see on our blog/Facebook/Instagram posts, <em>and</em> might be single-handedly responsible for all of the WoW achievement points mentioned on our <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>About Page</a>. We should also mention that she designed and illustrated that page. So yeah, her list of awesome just keeps going and going. Oh, and she writes fantasy novels. Seriously.</p><h3>How You’ll Work at YNAB</h3><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p>Live Where You Want</p><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work pretty much wherever you want (for this particular opening, there are some time-zone requirements). Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p>No Crazy Hours</p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p>Take Vacation (Seriously)</p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Something closer to five is about right. Plus we take two extra weeks for a Holiday break. It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p>The YNAB Meetup</p><p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'>Costa Rica</a>, a <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch on Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</p><p>Up Your Game</p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). We have a monthly book budget, send people to conferences, give dedicated time away from work to learn something new… it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</p><p>International is Absolutely Okay</p><p>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. We are spread all over the world, but for this particular position, we have a strong preference for candidates located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</p><p>If You’re Stateside…</p><p>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Why then, did you muddle through all of that awesomeness?)</p><p>Other Tidbits</p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </li><li>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not think that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. You will play a big, big part in helping the YNAB brand come to life and reach wider audiences. I’ll only say that six more times.</p><h2>Now, back to you, our new Visual Designer…</h2><p>As a visual designer at YNAB, you’ll live on two teams. You’ll be a prized resource for our marketing team, churning out ads, landing pages, and illustrations while maintaining the YNAB brand. As a member of the design team you’ll work alongside both UI/UX designers and visual designers to consistently improve the quality of visual design across the YNAB ecosystem. You will be our boots on the ground, protecting our brand with your pixel-perfect attention to detail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>What Success Looks Like:</h4><p>The marketing team marvels at your ability to think big and execute quickly on the smallest of tasks. You roll up your sleeves and deliver what’s needed, sometimes before the marketing team asks for it. Other designers can’t stop praising you for your museum-worthy artwork and strict approach to file management. You’ll probably make our CEO cry from time to time. Our campaigns are so beautiful he can barely look at them without bringing out a tissue. You also make us laugh. We like to laugh.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You take direction from multiple teams, and communicate freely. You understand that great communication and time management is critical to your success in a remote work environment. When you say it will be done, it will be done. Your teammates don’t even have to think about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You know a great designer loves the very smallest parts of the job. Some call it pixel pushing. Others call it production work. We call it craft. You love tweaking your designs in the browser and communicate easily with developers, including in HTML and CSS. Because that’s how it’s done.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem-solving for both creative and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to (devour, really) ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our company: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.</p><p>Bonus Points:</p><ul><li>You already use and love YNAB. </li><li>You have experience with animation and/or know how to prepare artwork for rigging. </li></ul><p>How to Apply</p><ul><li>Apply below by 11:59pm on August 19th, 2018. It’s a firm deadline.</li><li>Attach a PDF of your cover letter. In your cover letter:<ul><li>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit. </li><li>We love a designer with a perspective. What’s yours? Feel free to touch on your beliefs on how design should be done, what it’s used for, or why it’s important. </li></ul></li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for.</li><li>Please include a portfolio that contains the following (if you are linking to an online portfolio, be sure to include the details below in your cover letter):<ul><li>Examples of design work. &nbsp;</li><li>Your design process (wireframes, interviews, sketches).</li><li>Links to any live work. </li><li>Please state the role you played on each project and specify if certain artwork used in a design was not created by you.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>The Portfolio:</strong></p><p>Note: We greatly appreciate receiving work as a personal portfolio website, Dropbox folder, or PDF. Please do not send a Behance or Dribbble link unless you cannot do otherwise.</p><p>Include:</p><ul><li>Examples of marketing campaign content, landing pages, ads, and other assets. </li><li>Examples of vector artwork you have created.</li><li>Any style guides, brand documentation, or UI kits you have produced. </li><li>Examples of responsive web design. </li><li>Please include personal work only if LABELED AS SUCH. We prize real work with real stories over perfect spec work. </li></ul><p>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The deadline for applications is 11:59PM on August 19th, 2018. Firm. It’s a real deadline, the kind you love.</p></div></div><div></div></div></div>"

We’ve got an ecosystem of apps, live classes, and stellar support. Now we need our next visual designer to bring the same attention to detail to our branding, marketing, and educational materials. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>You come to the table with some experience under your belt. You know how to expand and maintain meticulous brand guidelines. You catch color mismatches that are mere shades off, you bristle at poor kerning, and you know that good design is in the details. You love to draw, and can create masterpieces with the pen tool. You also love to dream and get that our dream is to build a brand that is fun, smart, and approachable. </span><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span> Requirements (these are real, actual requirements):</span></p><ul><li><span>At least two years of experience working in marketing design.</span></li><li><span>Experience working within strict, existing brand guidelines. </span></li><li><span>Experience creating vector illustrations.</span></li><li><span>Experience doing time-sensitive production work. </span></li><li><span>Experience designing for responsive web. </span></li><li><span>Ability to work and communicate effectively in a remote environment.</span></li><li><span>Your home base must be located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span>A Bit About Us</span></h2><p><span>We build the best budgeting software around, YNAB or “You Need a Budget” if you have a lot of extra time on your hands. For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. (</span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a><span>, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean.) We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></p><p><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span></p><p><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> <span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span> has to really </span><span>click</span><span> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in, in which case, we can’t wait to hear from you! </span></p><p><span>First, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span></p><p><span>Who you’d be working with:</span></p><p><span>Todd, </span><span>our Chief Strategy Officer, obsesses about continuously improving our products and experiences our users have in them—and knows that process begins with design. He’ll have any conversation where he has the chance to learn something, and enjoys ideas for their own sake. He likes long gaps of silence </span><span>and </span><span>very loud music, running ultramarathons, and wants to disappear someday to make hand-crafted furniture.</span></p><p><span>Lindsey</span><span>, our Chief Marketing Officer, is in charge of getting the word out about YNAB, and always finds a fun way to do that. Like our </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/ynab-mixtape-2017/' rel='nofollow'><span>YNAB mix-tape</span></a><span>, where-in she wrote and re-recorded budgeting-related lyrics to pop-songs. (We suggest reading the rest of this description while listening to that album.)</span></p><p><span>Lauren </span><span>is our illustrator/designer. She is single-handedly responsible for almost all of the illustrations you see on our blog/Facebook/Instagram posts, _and_ might be single-handedly responsible for all of the WoW achievement points mentioned on our </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/about/' rel='nofollow'><span>About Page</span></a><span>. We should also mention that she designed and illustrated that page. So yeah, her list of awesome just keeps going and going. Oh, and she writes fantasy novels. Seriously.</span></p><h3><span>How You’ll Work at YNAB</span></h3><p><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></p><p><span>Live Where You Want</span></p><p><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work pretty much wherever you want (for this particular opening, there are some time-zone requirements). Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection. </span></p><p><span>No Crazy Hours</span></p><p><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></p><p><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></p><p><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span><span>minimum</span><span> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Something closer to five is about right. Plus we take two extra weeks for a Holiday break. It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span></p><p><span>The YNAB Meetup</span></p><p><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a><span>, a </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a><span> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch on Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></p><p><span>Up Your Game</span></p><p><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). We have a monthly book budget, send people to conferences, give dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>International is Absolutely Okay</span></p><p><span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. We are spread all over the world</span><span>, </span><span>but for this particular position, we have a strong preference for candidates located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</span><strong></strong></p><p><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></p><p><span>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span><span>and your family.</span><span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span><span>your retirement</span> <span>nest egg</span><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Why then, did you muddle through all of that awesomeness?)</span></p><p><span>Other Tidbits</span></p><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span></li><li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><span>standing</span><span>?) in front of a computer.</span></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not </span><span>think</span><span> that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span></li></ul><p><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now I want to talk about you. </span><span>You will play a big, big part in helping the YNAB brand come to life and reach wider audiences.</span><span> I’ll only say that six more times.</span></p><h2><span>Now, back to you, our new Visual Designer...</span></h2><p><span>As a visual designer at YNAB, you’ll live on </span><span>two </span><span>teams. You’ll be a prized resource for our marketing team, churning out ads, landing pages, and illustrations while maintaining the YNAB brand. As a member of the design team you’ll work alongside both UI/UX designers and visual designers to consistently improve the quality of visual design across the YNAB ecosystem. You will be our boots on the ground, protecting our brand with your pixel-perfect attention to detail.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4><span>What Success Looks Like: </span></h4><p><span>The marketing team marvels at your ability to think big and execute quickly on the smallest of tasks. You roll up your sleeves and deliver what’s needed, sometimes before the marketing team asks for it. Other designers can’t stop praising you for your museum-worthy artwork and strict approach to file management. You’ll probably make our CEO cry from time to time. Our campaigns are so beautiful he can barely look at them without bringing out a tissue. You also make us laugh. We like to laugh. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You take direction from multiple teams, and communicate freely. You understand that great communication and time management is critical to your success in a remote work environment. When you say it will be done, it will be done. Your teammates don’t even have to think about it.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>You know a great designer loves the very smallest parts of the job. Some call it pixel pushing. Others call it production work. We call it craft. You love tweaking your designs in the browser and communicate easily with developers, including in HTML and CSS. Because that’s how it’s done. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Finally, the success of a designer at YNAB hinges upon the ability to approach design as holistic problem-solving for both creative and business goals. We work collaboratively here and you’ll listen to (devour, really) ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience. That said, you know your stuff and can eloquently and logically explain design decisions. You see this type of exchange as critical to the success of yourself and our company: it is through sharing ideas and being open to the brilliance of others that we arrive at the best solutions.</span></p><p><span>Bonus Points: </span></p><ul><li><span>You already use and love YNAB. </span></li><li><span>You have experience with animation and/or know how to prepare artwork for rigging. </span></li></ul><p><span>How to Apply</span></p><ul><li><span>Apply below by 11:59pm on August 19th, 2018. </span><span>It’s a firm deadline.</span></li><li><span>Attach a PDF of your cover letter. In your cover letter:</span><ul><li><span>Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit. </span></li><li><span>We love a designer with a perspective. What’s yours? Feel free to touch on your beliefs on how design should be done, what it’s used for, or why it’s important. </span></li></ul></li><li><span>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for.</span></li><li><span>Please include a portfolio that contains the following (if you are linking to an online portfolio, be sure to include the details below in your cover letter): </span><ul><li><span>Examples of design work. &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Your design process (wireframes, interviews, sketches).</span></li><li><span>Links to any live work. </span></li><li><span>Please state the role you played on each project and specify if certain artwork used in a design was not created by you.</span></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong><span>The Portfolio:</span> </strong></p><p><span>Note: We greatly appreciate receiving work as a personal portfolio website, Dropbox folder, or PDF. </span><span>Please do not send a Behance or Dribbble link unless you cannot do otherwise. </span></p><p><span>Include: </span></p><ul><li><span>Examples of marketing campaign content, landing pages, ads, and other assets. </span></li><li><span>Examples of vector artwork you have created.</span></li><li><span>Any style guides, brand documentation, or UI kits you have produced. </span></li><li><span>Examples of responsive web design. </span></li><li><span>Please include personal work only if LABELED AS SUCH. We prize real work with real stories over perfect spec work. </span></li></ul><p><span>P.S. &nbsp;If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you&nbsp;passed this along!</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The deadline for applications is 11:59PM on August 19th, 2018. Firm. It’s a real deadline, the kind you love. </span></p><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>"

It is a place where people can comment on news in depth, and share their opinions through social media. </p><p>When multiple people have &quot;fisked&quot; the same article, the system produces a page which highlights the flaws or qualities in the text, as determined by a statistical test of significance of the (human-input) tags. In short, it has the potential to fact-check all online news/content in real time.</p><p>Additionally, by allowing users to fisk each other's comments, we create a granular, peer-reviewed discussion of the topic which is much more useful - and useable -  for interested readers. This allows us to build in a Troll Filter which will enable readers to weed out bad-faith commentary, while preserving Fiskkit's &quot;No Censorship&quot; principle. </p><p>It's the future of online engagement.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Francisco</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>$21K Seed in 2014</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Digital Media</span>, <span>News</span>, <span>Blogging Platforms</span>, <span>Writers</span></div><div><div></div><a href='http://twitter.com/fiskkit' rel='nofollow'>@fiskkit</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://fiskkit.com' rel='nofollow'>fiskkit.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/645/391645-448935d3377d1e925a3c4868e17c8b5d97850972.jpg?1409434617' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/647/391647-1e2834f49606b3cc6be857b62670a3939201a96a.jpg?1409434718' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/653/391653-4abd9dfabc6ac13a568b82e72b51dd09de011e30.png?1409439518' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/654/391654-3db0f14b8aa81d645cbb9119181aa85131aa4726.png?1409439529' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/391/658/391658-79c6f923d2c1e0cbb66632c67a0449fed8efaa64.jpg?1409441817' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/386434-fiskkit?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;Fiskkit&quot;

security technology called &quot;BiTSentry&quot; that stops malware and reduces the risk of vulnerabilities starting with the 2 billion devices powered by Android.</p><p>Unlike our competitors, BiTSentry is 100% effective at mitigating the risk of malware because we assume everything is a threat up front.  We do not detect or predict anything.  We isolate everything.</p><p>Our technology includes a microkernel, super lightweight virtual machine manager (hypervisor) and encryption management designed to replace the vulnerable and large (14M+ lines of code) linux kernel that Android is built on.  Our microkernel is &lt; 100K lines of code, resulting in a super small attack surface and secure foundation for Android.  This is the first step.  </p><p>Next, we change how executables run on Android so that every application and its data, regardless if its a system app or one you download, runs in its own isolated environment.  </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Diego</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Android</span>, <span>Tablets</span>, <span>Cyber Security</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/secureduniverse' rel='nofollow'>@secureduniverse</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://blog.secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>http://blog.secureduniverse.com</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>secureduniverse.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Secured Universe</h3><ul><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69250-aosp-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>AOSP Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69253-virtualization-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Virtualization Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69254-full-stack-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Full Stack Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69401-machine-learning-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Machine Learning Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/73426-kernel-hacker' rel='nofollow'>Kernel Hacker</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Operations Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69045-cfo-co-fundraiser' rel='nofollow'>CFO &amp; Co-Fundraiser</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$120K – $200K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/265393-a-real-hustler-fundraiser-hellraiser' rel='nofollow'>A REAL HUSTLER, FUNDRAISER, HELLRAISER</a><div>San Diego, Silicon Valley·Full Time<span></span><span>·$250K – $300K · 0.0% – 2.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Secured Universe Team</h3><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/steven-rahseparian' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/steven-rahseparian' rel='nofollow'>Steven Rahseparian</a><span>,</span></div><div>34+ Years Software Engineer.

Whether it’s with customers, employees, or a target market, SurveyMonkey helps curious individuals and companies — including 99% of the Fortune 500 — have conversations at scale with the people who matter most. It’s People Powered Data that allows them to understand not only “what” is happening, but “why.” SurveyMonkey’s 700+ employees throughout North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific are dedicated to powering the curious.</p><p></p><strong>About SurveyMonkey Business Solutions</strong><p>SurveyMonkey is the world’s most popular survey platform. While it is a great general-purpose tool used by millions, there is ample opportunity for more specialized solutions. That’s where we come in. We build standalone, targeted SaaS products that bring great UX to solving more specific business problems.</p><p>To date, our 12-person team has shipped three products:</p><ul></ul><li>&nbsp;– Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a><li>&nbsp;– Understand and foster employee engagement</li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a><li>&nbsp;– Source and publish 3rd-party verified customer proof</li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a><p>We’re on a mission to bring better design to the business world, and while we’re at it we’d like to make our mark with stunning data viz, personable interfaces, and a commitment to empathizing with our users.</p><p></p><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong><p>We’re looking for a talented designer with demonstrable experience working on user-friendly SaaS applications. Your portfolio should demonstrate the ability to design for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop. You should also be comfortable writing clear, concise UI copy.</p><p>Strong visual design, product design, usability, and communication skills are essential. Technical skills such as CSS, Javascript, and familiarity with Ruby on Rails are also a strong plus, though not required. Experience contributing to a central design system is a major plus and you will have opportunity to participate as we evolve ours.</p><p>If you’re jazzed about making really complex things super simple we should talk. If you’re interested in creating the future of intuitive data visualization (and have an opinion on what that means) we should talk. If you believe that great design belongs everywhere and have the mettle to make it happen, we should&nbsp;&nbsp;talk.</p><em>definitely</em><p></p><strong>Qualifications</strong><ul></ul><li>3+ years of experience on a product design team working across the entire product development lifecycle and successfully shipping products.</li><li>Experience working effectively with cross-functional teams including shepherding designs through the development process.</li><li>Experience collaborating with other designers to create a cohesive cross-product experience, both leveraging and contributing to a centralized design system.</li><li>Solid user-centered design fundamentals with information architecture, interaction design and visual design skills and the ability to quickly produce high quality deliverables across the range of disciplines.</li><li>Demonstrated ability to write clear, effective UI copy.</li><li>Ability to present design solutions at all levels of the organization with clear, articulate rationale.</li><li>Proficient with Sketch, Invision, Creative Suite, and knowledgeable about HTML, CSS, modern browser technologies, and cross-device design.</li><li>Portfolio showcasing examples of product design work.</li><p></p><strong>Why Work Here?</strong><p>We are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific timezone by at least four hours, where you live and work and up to you. We’re not strangers though — in addition to a sane amount of video calls, we meet up quarterly to get to know each other better and have some fun. In the past year, we’ve been bowling in Phoenix, made sushi in San Francisco, and toured a brewery.</p><p>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. As such, you will be expected to be a manager of one.</p><p>Naturally, we offer competitive salaries and annual bonuses, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and meaningful equity compensation. We also supply you with top of the line equipment for your home office.</p><p>Finally, in a world of clunky “enterprise” software, we consider great UX and visual design to be a strategic advantage, and we need you to help us keep improving. Our track record gives our team a lot of autonomy — this is your chance to rethink how “business solutions” should look and function, and to have fun while doing it.</p><p>Join us.</p><p>At SurveyMonkey, we offer competitive salaries, medical/dental benefits, PTO, 401k, paid holidays and parental leave, and equity compensation.</p><p>SurveyMonkey is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.</p><div> <div><div><p>To apply for this job please visit the following URL: <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/surveymonkey/jobs/1259530' rel='nofollow'>https://boards.greenhouse.io/surveymonkey/jobs/1259530 →</a></p></div></div></div>"

We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.</p><p>ConsenSys is presently comprised of a number of core personnel — some of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development, acquisitions, investments, or the formation of joint ventures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Brooklyn</span>, Remote

If that's you and you have a portfolio to back that up, feel free to quote your hourly or project rate upfront.</p><p>Core Data currently needs an additional HTML5 web designer with react and redux experience to create a major expansion on the company's HTML5-based UI. The existing UI can be seen at this <a href='http://coredata.eu/newui' rel='nofollow'>link</a>. The existing UI is focused on displaying available offers for live (actively in play) sports games and uses a simplified navigation scheme where the user simply selects a sport, then a game, and ultimately selects what wagers are wanted.</p><p>The candidate will need to expand this User Interface to include &quot;prematch&quot; betting. Mockup designs for this have already been prepared <a href='https://coredata.eu/designer.html' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. The enhancement will keep all existing functionality of the live UI, but add a tab/screen for upcoming games that have not yet started. The list of available prematch games is numerous (sometimes in the thousands) and so the navigation scheme will be much more sophisticated than the live (current) navigation scheme. The company's goal is to have a clean, smooth, and intuitive cross-browser product.</p><p>The candidate will be expected to combine their knowledge of aesthetics and intuitive UX principles to create a cutting-edge, crisp, and attractive prematch expansion to the company's UI. The existing UI uses React.JS and Redux, so prior experience with these frameworks is necessary. The backend data to power the UI is provided vi a WebSockets feed and our backend team can make reasonable changes to the feed format if it is necessary to facilitate a speedy project completion.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/193809?reset=False&amp;ra=12ZQuM6F5hBu&amp;oqs=a%3D12ZQuM6F5hBu' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Core Data</h3>            <div><p>First and foremost, we are a software development company owned and operated entirely by professionals with a strong technical background. &nbsp;Since technology is our core focus and software is our principal product, all projects at&nbsp;CDS are important and recognized by the highest levels of management.</p><p>We believe in hiring the best candidates for every position. &nbsp;It is for this reason that we do not restrict ourselves to arbitrary geographical locations. &nbsp;Most of our staff works on a remote basis. &nbsp;Our hiring decisions are based on one's abilities, not location.</p><p>The projects we take on run the gamut.&nbsp; Primarily we are a data and statistics provider with an emphasis on low-latency, real-time data feeds.&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly paid time off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours / work schedules</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

We work with Product to help scope, design, and test new features and interfaces. We work with Engineering to help breathe life into those interfaces and bring them to our users. We work with Customer Success to understand and address existing pain points.</p><p>You’ll be tasked with understanding use cases, exploring innovative UI solutions, and identifying usability problems. Throughout the design process, you’ll create and communicate UX flows, develop mockups, and contribute to user personas. You’ll design clean, modern interfaces across different browsers and devices using the latest responsive methods. During all of this, you’ll participate in user testing sessions, continuing to refine the experience for our users.</p><p>Hireology is based in Chicago, but our Engineering and UX teams work remotely, so you’ll have the option of working from the comfort of your home or right in our office if you’re local. Compensation is competitive, and we offer a full benefits package. We have regular company-wide events, semi-annual team gatherings, and frequent celebrations when we hit our goals.</p><p>As one of our UX Designers, you’ll be responsible for:</p><ul><li>Developing sketches, diagrams, and designs.</li><li>Collaborating with engineers, product managers, and users to deliver amazing experiences</li><li>Working closely with our Product Managers to solve business problems.</li><li>Advocating, designing, and planning qualitative and quantitative design experiments for our products</li><li>Being a user-advocate during the entire development process</li></ul><p>So what kind of person are we looking for in this role? We have a pretty unique culture here at Hireology, and the person who will be successful in this role:</p><ul><li>Considers User Experience as more than just aesthetics</li><li>Constantly searches for simplicity</li><li>Loves constructive criticism</li><li>Is obsessed with understanding the way people “work” and think</li><li>Is comfortable doing user research and intelligently integrating findings into your work</li><li>Has the ability to distill key issues from usability tests and implement practical solutions</li><li>Has the flexibility and agility to iterate or change design direction based on external feedback</li><li>Has a passion for design and great user experience</li><li>Works well both in a collaborative team environment and independently</li><li>Is a lifelong learner with a continuous eye for improving craft</li><li>Is a highly motivated self-starter with a positive attitude</li></ul><p>Okay, we’ve laid out what the job is - now are you qualified? Below are the minimum qualifications we’re looking for in a UX Designer. Also, we want a chance to get to know who you are and why you applied, so please include a cover letter.</p><ul><li>Three to six years of user experience or product design experience.</li><li>Experience designing complex web applications.</li><li>Strong knowledge of user experience design, information architecture, interaction design, and website development methodology.</li><li>Familiar with conducting user research.</li><li>A working understanding of personas, journey maps, and usability testing.</li><li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills.</li><li>Must be authorized to work in the United States.</li></ul><p>So what can you expect after you apply? You will:</p><ul><li>Take a brief true/false survey. Be sure to check your email after you apply.</li><li>Have a phone conversation with someone on our UX team. This is a high level conversation about you, but also a good opportunity for you to learn more about us.</li><li>Meet with our other UX Designers to talk shop. Be prepared to talk about how you approach work technically with examples of how you have done it in the past. No homework or on-the-spot assignments. We just want to nerd out a bit with you.</li><li>Go over your career history with our Senior Manager of UX. This will be an opportunity for us to get an idea of how you got to where you are, and if where you want to go lines up with where we are going.</li><li>Meet virtually with some more of the remote team. We want to give you some idea of the people you will be working with. We ask the serious questions here, like your top three movies.</li><li>Provide us some references. We use our automated reference check system for this, so you just give us some names, they fill out a survey, and we are all set.</li><li>Speak with a member of our leadership team. If you have made it this far, just be yourself, and everything will be fine.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>"

These endeavors, however, are only the start of a passion led journey to disrupt the yacht charter market by focusing on one thing - cusomer peace of mind. </p><p>We examined every element of the sailing experience to establish exactly where expectations lay and how they could be exceeded. Price motivates many, this was an obvious start point. Thus SailChecker will never be beaten on an honest price. Yet this is not the battle we are looking to fight and win. </p><p>Right now there are few tools available to help customers discriminate between yachts beyond the age and price of the boat. Yet our research showed that there were so many features of the perfect charter. </p><p>Do you have something to offer? Something interesting and dynamic?

If you are as passionate about mentoring as you are about UX, and can give a few hours per week in return for an honorarium, we would love to hear from you.</p><p>Please find more details about the program below.</p><p>-- Completely online and self-paced. Coursework is ~100 hours and on average, students finish it in 2-3 months. <br>-- Participants in this course are working professionals and college students from all over the world, interested in getting started with UX Design. <br>-- Participants learn about UX with the help of a curated online curriculum, many projects and a personal mentor.

We are bootstrapped, profitable, and hungry for growth, in business, and personal lives. Join us for a rewarding journey!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Why SupportBee</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Tech-focused</b></div><div>We pride ourselves on the quality of our tech stack and strive to maintain it. One of the founders wrote a ton of the early code and shaped the tech culture. We have been practicing test-driven development since we started in 2011 and we have written a lot about our tech stack and delivered several talks on it as well. Everyone in the company is comfortable using a text editor and the command line and focuses on improving workflows - whether they relate to customer support or server infrastructure.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Data-driven</b></div><div>We use Mixpanel and Google Analytics to track an array of events and properties on the app’s usage. With this rich usage data flowing in, we can answer questions about feature usage, and identify companies that are using specific features (or not using them).&nbsp; It helps us improve the product and avoid working on ideas with little ROI. We have a data-driven culture — as a team, we rely on data to drive decisions about the product.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Deep domain expertise</b></div><div>We have been working on SupportBee since 2011. We launched the product in September 2012. Since then we have learned a ton about our domain — problems customers face, technical challenges in solving them, and ways to monetize effectively (aligning value provided with monetization strategies). Customer support is a complex domain and working with a deep understanding of the domain is fun and rewarding. It lets us tackle complex problems and build creative solutions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Remote Work Culture</b></div><div>We don’t have an office, and all of us join in from around the world. Currently, we are from Bolivia, Europe, United States, and India. All we require is a great internet connection, a few hours of overlap with the team, and presence in the daily standup meeting at 9am EST. Our work happens on Github, Trello, and Slack and we believe in the power of asynchronous, and clear written communication.</div><div><br></div><div><b>A culture based on respect and acceptance</b></div><div>We founded the company first and foremost to be a great place to work. We wanted to create a workspace where we would enjoy working every day. That goal is more important to us now than ever before. We value diversity - our team comes from many different parts of the world. Founded by two women, we have had several women contribute to the company over the last decade. A company's culture is a living thing and forever evolving. Ours isn't perfect, and we want you to help us shape it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The road ahead is exciting</b></div><div>While customer support is a crowded space, ticketing hasn't inherently changed in the last decade or two. With our domain understanding, we want to create a new kind of customer support software, and we want you to be a part of this exciting journey.&nbsp; We'll talk more about this when we chat with you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Your Role</b></div><div>You’ll be working on both the product and our marketing efforts. On the product side, your day to day work will involve creating mockups for new features or improvements, designing them (we love sketch) and giving feedback to the development team as they implement your designs. You’ll also be working on customer support (we all do) to learn from customers and get a first hand feel for SupportBee.</div><div><br></div><div>On the marketing side, you will help us create a stronger brand and tell a better story. You will also work on improving our style guides. We use them to drive both the product and the marketing. All of us want to become better at designing experiences and we would love to learn from you.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, we want to scale up our design team and you’ll be helping us attract and hire great designers. This would involve writing about the design process at SupportBee, and sharing your work with the world (dribbble, talks, and interviews etc).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>What we are looking for</b></div><div><br></div><div>* 3+ years of experience designing web &amp; mobile applications</div><div>* Excellent verbal and written&nbsp;communication skills (in English)</div><div>* Experience in designing UI/UX for rich web applications.&nbsp;</div><div>* Experience with Semantic UI (we use it extensively)</div><div>* Experience in writing SCSS and a sound understanding of HTML.</div><div>* Some experience with Javascript or the willingness to learn it (so you can understand our stack and the build process etc).</div><div>* A passion for details (like micro-interactions) and shipping improvements to customers.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What we are offering</b></div><div><br></div><div>* $35K - $45K salary per year (USD).</div><div>* 0.1 - 0.5% stock options vested over four years with a one year cliff.</div><div>* Any hardware or software that you need to excel at your job.</div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>We want to see examples of your work and want to understand your design philosophy. Send an email to <a href='mailto:hello@supportbee.com' rel='nofollow'>hello@supportbee.com</a> with the subject - &quot;Designer -  Weworkremotely&quot;. Please attach links to your work and answers to a few questions* Send us a few ideas for our app after taking a look at it (we offer a 14 day trial so you can use that)* What SaaS apps do you find the most interesting? Why?* If you could build anything, what would it be?Send us a book recommendation and tell us why you picked that one. </p>  </div>"
