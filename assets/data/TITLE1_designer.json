Dabei kommt es vor allen Dingen darauf an, dass du den Nutzer im Blick behältst, dass du sagst, welche Informationen wo zusammenfließen sollen, wie man die Wege kurz hält und die Informationen strukturiert darstellt.</p><p>Du solltest mehrere Jahre Erfahrung in der Entwicklung mit Angular haben, gut mit HTML und SCSS umgehen können und sicher darin sein, einfache Events mit TypeScript zu handlen. Komplexere Berechnungen und das Zusammenziehen der Informationen erledigt das Backend, so dass du dich aufs Design (auch für Mobile Devices) und die UserExperience konzentrieren kannst.</p><p>Dafür ist es auch nötig, eng mit Externen und anderen Firmenmitgliedern außerhalb der Entwicklung zusammenzuarbeiten, so dass du Deutsch auf Niveau C2 beherrschen musst. Entwicklungsintern sprechen wir viel Englisch, dafür genügt aber Niveau B2.</p><p>Wir haben für den Start ein Webshop-Template gekauft und bereits Internationalisierung mit i18n eingebaut. Jetzt brauchen wir dich – bewirb dich mit einigen deiner bisherigen Projekte – zeig uns, was du magst und worauf du stolz bist.
