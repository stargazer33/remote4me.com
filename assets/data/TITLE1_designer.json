If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us.</p><p>About Organizational Development at ConsenSys</p><p>Consensys is developing itself as a self organizing system.

We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.</p><p>ConsenSys is presently comprised of a number of core personnel — some of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development, acquisitions, investments, or the formation of joint ventures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Brooklyn</span>, Remote

If that's you and you have a portfolio to back that up, feel free to quote your hourly or project rate upfront.</p><p>Core Data currently needs an additional HTML5 web designer with react and redux experience to create a major expansion on the company's HTML5-based UI. The existing UI can be seen at this <a href='http://coredata.eu/newui' rel='nofollow'>link</a>. The existing UI is focused on displaying available offers for live (actively in play) sports games and uses a simplified navigation scheme where the user simply selects a sport, then a game, and ultimately selects what wagers are wanted.</p><p>The candidate will need to expand this User Interface to include &quot;prematch&quot; betting. Mockup designs for this have already been prepared <a href='https://coredata.eu/designer.html' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. The enhancement will keep all existing functionality of the live UI, but add a tab/screen for upcoming games that have not yet started. The list of available prematch games is numerous (sometimes in the thousands) and so the navigation scheme will be much more sophisticated than the live (current) navigation scheme. The company's goal is to have a clean, smooth, and intuitive cross-browser product.</p><p>The candidate will be expected to combine their knowledge of aesthetics and intuitive UX principles to create a cutting-edge, crisp, and attractive prematch expansion to the company's UI. The existing UI uses React.JS and Redux, so prior experience with these frameworks is necessary. The backend data to power the UI is provided vi a WebSockets feed and our backend team can make reasonable changes to the feed format if it is necessary to facilitate a speedy project completion.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/193809?reset=False&amp;ra=12ZQuM6F5hBu&amp;oqs=a%3D12ZQuM6F5hBu' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Core Data</h3>            <div><p>First and foremost, we are a software development company owned and operated entirely by professionals with a strong technical background. &nbsp;Since technology is our core focus and software is our principal product, all projects at&nbsp;CDS are important and recognized by the highest levels of management.</p><p>We believe in hiring the best candidates for every position. &nbsp;It is for this reason that we do not restrict ourselves to arbitrary geographical locations. &nbsp;Most of our staff works on a remote basis. &nbsp;Our hiring decisions are based on one's abilities, not location.</p><p>The projects we take on run the gamut.&nbsp; Primarily we are a data and statistics provider with an emphasis on low-latency, real-time data feeds.&nbsp;</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly paid time off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Compensation</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible hours / work schedules</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

We work with Product to help scope, design, and test new features and interfaces. We work with Engineering to help breathe life into those interfaces and bring them to our users. We work with Customer Success to understand and address existing pain points.</p><p>You’ll be tasked with understanding use cases, exploring innovative UI solutions, and identifying usability problems. Throughout the design process, you’ll create and communicate UX flows, develop mockups, and contribute to user personas. You’ll design clean, modern interfaces across different browsers and devices using the latest responsive methods. During all of this, you’ll participate in user testing sessions, continuing to refine the experience for our users.</p><p>Hireology is based in Chicago, but our Engineering and UX teams work remotely, so you’ll have the option of working from the comfort of your home or right in our office if you’re local. Compensation is competitive, and we offer a full benefits package. We have regular company-wide events, semi-annual team gatherings, and frequent celebrations when we hit our goals.</p><p>As one of our UX Designers, you’ll be responsible for:</p><ul><li>Developing sketches, diagrams, and designs.</li><li>Collaborating with engineers, product managers, and users to deliver amazing experiences</li><li>Working closely with our Product Managers to solve business problems.</li><li>Advocating, designing, and planning qualitative and quantitative design experiments for our products</li><li>Being a user-advocate during the entire development process</li></ul><p>So what kind of person are we looking for in this role? We have a pretty unique culture here at Hireology, and the person who will be successful in this role:</p><ul><li>Considers User Experience as more than just aesthetics</li><li>Constantly searches for simplicity</li><li>Loves constructive criticism</li><li>Is obsessed with understanding the way people “work” and think</li><li>Is comfortable doing user research and intelligently integrating findings into your work</li><li>Has the ability to distill key issues from usability tests and implement practical solutions</li><li>Has the flexibility and agility to iterate or change design direction based on external feedback</li><li>Has a passion for design and great user experience</li><li>Works well both in a collaborative team environment and independently</li><li>Is a lifelong learner with a continuous eye for improving craft</li><li>Is a highly motivated self-starter with a positive attitude</li></ul><p>Okay, we’ve laid out what the job is - now are you qualified? Below are the minimum qualifications we’re looking for in a UX Designer. Also, we want a chance to get to know who you are and why you applied, so please include a cover letter.</p><ul><li>Three to six years of user experience or product design experience.</li><li>Experience designing complex web applications.</li><li>Strong knowledge of user experience design, information architecture, interaction design, and website development methodology.</li><li>Familiar with conducting user research.</li><li>A working understanding of personas, journey maps, and usability testing.</li><li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills.</li><li>Must be authorized to work in the United States.</li></ul><p>So what can you expect after you apply? You will:</p><ul><li>Take a brief true/false survey. Be sure to check your email after you apply.</li><li>Have a phone conversation with someone on our UX team. This is a high level conversation about you, but also a good opportunity for you to learn more about us.</li><li>Meet with our other UX Designers to talk shop. Be prepared to talk about how you approach work technically with examples of how you have done it in the past. No homework or on-the-spot assignments. We just want to nerd out a bit with you.</li><li>Go over your career history with our Senior Manager of UX. This will be an opportunity for us to get an idea of how you got to where you are, and if where you want to go lines up with where we are going.</li><li>Meet virtually with some more of the remote team. We want to give you some idea of the people you will be working with. We ask the serious questions here, like your top three movies.</li><li>Provide us some references. We use our automated reference check system for this, so you just give us some names, they fill out a survey, and we are all set.</li><li>Speak with a member of our leadership team. If you have made it this far, just be yourself, and everything will be fine.</li></ul><p></p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> </p>"

We are bootstrapped, profitable, and hungry for growth, in business, and personal lives. Join us for a rewarding journey!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Why SupportBee</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Tech-focused</b></div><div>We pride ourselves on the quality of our tech stack and strive to maintain it. One of the founders wrote a ton of the early code and shaped the tech culture. We have been practicing test-driven development since we started in 2011 and we have written a lot about our tech stack and delivered several talks on it as well. Everyone in the company is comfortable using a text editor and the command line and focuses on improving workflows - whether they relate to customer support or server infrastructure.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Data-driven</b></div><div>We use Mixpanel and Google Analytics to track an array of events and properties on the app’s usage. With this rich usage data flowing in, we can answer questions about feature usage, and identify companies that are using specific features (or not using them).&nbsp; It helps us improve the product and avoid working on ideas with little ROI. We have a data-driven culture — as a team, we rely on data to drive decisions about the product.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Deep domain expertise</b></div><div>We have been working on SupportBee since 2011. We launched the product in September 2012. Since then we have learned a ton about our domain — problems customers face, technical challenges in solving them, and ways to monetize effectively (aligning value provided with monetization strategies). Customer support is a complex domain and working with a deep understanding of the domain is fun and rewarding. It lets us tackle complex problems and build creative solutions.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Remote Work Culture</b></div><div>We don’t have an office, and all of us join in from around the world. Currently, we are from Bolivia, Europe, United States, and India. All we require is a great internet connection, a few hours of overlap with the team, and presence in the daily standup meeting at 9am EST. Our work happens on Github, Trello, and Slack and we believe in the power of asynchronous, and clear written communication.</div><div><br></div><div><b>A culture based on respect and acceptance</b></div><div>We founded the company first and foremost to be a great place to work. We wanted to create a workspace where we would enjoy working every day. That goal is more important to us now than ever before. We value diversity - our team comes from many different parts of the world. Founded by two women, we have had several women contribute to the company over the last decade. A company's culture is a living thing and forever evolving. Ours isn't perfect, and we want you to help us shape it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The road ahead is exciting</b></div><div>While customer support is a crowded space, ticketing hasn't inherently changed in the last decade or two. With our domain understanding, we want to create a new kind of customer support software, and we want you to be a part of this exciting journey.&nbsp; We'll talk more about this when we chat with you.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Your Role</b></div><div>You’ll be working on both the product and our marketing efforts. On the product side, your day to day work will involve creating mockups for new features or improvements, designing them (we love sketch) and giving feedback to the development team as they implement your designs. You’ll also be working on customer support (we all do) to learn from customers and get a first hand feel for SupportBee.</div><div><br></div><div>On the marketing side, you will help us create a stronger brand and tell a better story. You will also work on improving our style guides. We use them to drive both the product and the marketing. All of us want to become better at designing experiences and we would love to learn from you.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, we want to scale up our design team and you’ll be helping us attract and hire great designers. This would involve writing about the design process at SupportBee, and sharing your work with the world (dribbble, talks, and interviews etc).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>What we are looking for</b></div><div><br></div><div>* 3+ years of experience designing web &amp; mobile applications</div><div>* Excellent verbal and written&nbsp;communication skills (in English)</div><div>* Experience in designing UI/UX for rich web applications.&nbsp;</div><div>* Experience with Semantic UI (we use it extensively)</div><div>* Experience in writing SCSS and a sound understanding of HTML.</div><div>* Some experience with Javascript or the willingness to learn it (so you can understand our stack and the build process etc).</div><div>* A passion for details (like micro-interactions) and shipping improvements to customers.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What we are offering</b></div><div><br></div><div>* $35K - $45K salary per year (USD).</div><div>* 0.1 - 0.5% stock options vested over four years with a one year cliff.</div><div>* Any hardware or software that you need to excel at your job.</div><div><br></div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>We want to see examples of your work and want to understand your design philosophy. Send an email to <a href='mailto:hello@supportbee.com' rel='nofollow'>hello@supportbee.com</a> with the subject - &quot;Designer -  Weworkremotely&quot;. Please attach links to your work and answers to a few questions* Send us a few ideas for our app after taking a look at it (we offer a 14 day trial so you can use that)* What SaaS apps do you find the most interesting? Why?* If you could build anything, what would it be?Send us a book recommendation and tell us why you picked that one. </p>  </div>"
