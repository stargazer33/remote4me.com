We've previously built startups where we've hired over 100 roles, sold to 20% of F500s, raised over $45mm in aggregate, gotten the businesses acquired, and built/ran teams of engineers from MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Google, FB, YC, MSR.</p><p>We received strong funding offers from a number of top tier VCs. We’re lucky to be working with a senior GP at our lead investor, along with a number of esteemed angels/funds, including well-known leaders in the design community.</p><p>We're looking for two more individuals:</p><p>- Founding generalist engineer. No particular tech specialization necessary (we use Typescript and React), but we’re ideally looking for a product-oriented engineer who has deep frontend experience.</p><p>- Founding design/product role - someone who has worked in a few different orgs (esp. the big product tech companies with strong design), knows their design tools, is interested in or has done product work, and has an extensive network of designers / can wear the evangelist hat.</p><p>In either role, you would be directly shaping everything from product direction to team to culture.</p><p>If interested, please drop us a line ASAP at designtoolstartup@googlegroups.com.

Despite being new to the market, Instilled is built on a mature product with a solid client base and consolidates a wealth of experience and technology from our parent group. We are a small, agile team in a much larger learning technology business that is successful and passionate about creating outstanding learning tools.</p><p>What Instilled provides is a YouTube like experience for learners to discover content and progress at their own pace—it was originally a video platform, so included are a host of video features such as auto-captioning, auto-translation and commenting etc.</p><p>We are still in the early stages of this products transformation but we have huge aspirations and want developers that relish the opportunity to create industry-leading products.</p><p><strong>How will I know this is for me?</strong></p><p>First, this is a UK-specific role.&nbsp;<strong>Candidates must be eligible to work in the UK.</strong>&nbsp;Our team does have a US component, but we are not currently hiring for&nbsp;any US roles.</p><p>Our ideal candidate is friendly, enthusiastic and just as passionate about technology as we are. The team spans multiple offices and time-zones so a self-starter attitude and excellent communication skills are key. We know not everyone has experience of the learning industry but that’s fine, we want people that understand code. Our current tech stack is comprised of Java, Spring, PostgreSQL, AngularJS, and others. These things change though, so whilst prior experience is advantageous, the key is being able to adapt to whatever technology the task demands. We look for developers that have an opinion about how technology can be applied, but remain equally open minded about new or different approaches. Working well in a team is vital as this role will be fundamental in shaping our product architecture - clearly articulating a concept and nurturing other team members is hugely important.</p><p><strong>Ok, sounds great! What do I do?</strong></p><p>This is a unique opportunity to join a dynamic product team that is taking an impressive client list in to a whole new world of learning. If this sounds like a good fit then we would like to hear from you. Please send over a cover letter explaining why and attach your CV. Feel free to outline any achievements you are particularly proud of and include a link to code you can share.

You&rsquo;ll be the lead designer on our exciting new brand and so will have a great deal of autonomy with your creative executions.</p><br /><p class=&quot;&quot;>Whilst the role is predominantly based in London, we offer great flexibility with working hours and where you work from. All we ask is that you maintain an open communication and ensure you deliver on the work set out for you.</p><br /><p class=&quot;&quot;>The ideal candidate will have at least 3 years experience working across all areas of design (print and digital) and will feel confident figuring out how to work with new design formats as and when they arise. They will have a strong portfolio of work and feel comfortable, on occasion, taking the initiative if required. &nbsp;</p><br /><p class=&quot;&quot;>We&rsquo;re currently in the early stages of our expansion, which means your role will expand as the company does. Above all, our team are a wonderful, friendly bunch who are all passionate about innovating in the ethical food space, so it would be a big bonus if you were passionate in that area too!</p><br /><p class=&quot;&quot;>If you&rsquo;re interested in applying, please send over your portfolio, CV, and a quick cover letter to tell us a bit more about yourself. We can&rsquo;t wait to hear from you!</p><br /><p class=&quot;&quot;><strong>A bit more about us:</strong><br /><br />At Better Nature, our mission is to make our food system more people-, planet- and animal-friendly. And we think we&rsquo;ve found the perfect way to do so - through the power of tempeh! Tempeh (pronounced tem-pay) fermentation takes any legume, nut, grain or seed (it&rsquo;s typically made using soybeans) and transforms them into an even better food source. It binds them into a meaty block that&rsquo;s high in protein and fibre and is great for the gut.</p><br /><p>And it doesn&rsquo;t stop there - our talented team is working with tempeh to make it even more nutritious, delicious, as well as turning it into lots of new and exciting high-protein products.
