(Disclaimer: Someone on the Marketing Team is writing this, but it’s true!) We work very collaboratively, and there’s a lot of all-hands-on-deck, but primarily you’d be heads down with Shannon, our cat-and-yoga-loving Writer, Tristan, an oil painter and animator who brings our doodles to life as our Motion Graphics Designer, and Ben, who loves board games more than you, and is our unofficial mascot and social media lead. (You will love them!) Plus, part of your charge will be to maximize our internal resources company-wide, so you’ll get to work with lots of different (amazing) players! </div><div><br></div><div><span>Still interested? Here’s a little more about life at YNAB and the specifics of the position…</span></div><div><br></div><div><h3><span>How&nbsp;You'll Work at YNAB</span></h3></div><div><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Live Where You Want</h4></div><div><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work pretty much wherever you want (for this particular opening, there are some time-zone requirements). Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>No Crazy Hours</h4></div><div><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Take Vacation (Seriously)</h4></div><div><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Something closer to five is about right. Plus we take two extra weeks for a Holiday break. It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>The YNAB Meetup</h4></div><div><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span>&nbsp;Costa Rica</span></a><span>, a&nbsp;</span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a><span>&nbsp;in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, and a ranch on Montana. We do really fun things, but the highlight is always just hanging out together and having a blast.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Up Your Game</h4></div><div><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). We have a monthly book budget, send people to conferences, give dedicated time away from work to learn something new... it’s really up to you and your manager. But we love to see our people growing. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>International is Absolutely Okay</h4></div><div><span>If you are Stateside, we’ll set you up as a W2 employee. If you’re international, you’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. We are spread all over the world, but for this particular position, we have a strong preference for candidates located +/- two hours from North American Central Time.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>If You’re Stateside…</h4></div><div><span>YNAB offers fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We also have a Traditional and Roth 401k option. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>Other Tidbits</h4></div><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</span></li><li><span>The bucket list really helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</span></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried&nbsp;</span><em><em>standing</em></em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not&nbsp;</span><em><em>think</em></em><span>&nbsp;that matters much, but then a few months down the road you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</span></li></ul><div><h2><strong>Now, back to you, our new Video Content Producer...</strong></h2></div><div><span>Now that you know a little bit more about us, here’s some more info about what we’re looking for in the Video Content Producer...</span></div><div><br></div><div><b><strong>We’re Good At Telling Our Story, But We’re Looking To Up Our Game At&nbsp;</strong><strong><strong>Showing</strong></strong></b><b>&nbsp;It. </b>&nbsp; </div><div><br></div><div><span>We have some great writers, our founder Tweets occasionally, we have a weekly podcast, and we push social content all day, everyday, but something is missing. We’re looking for a Video Content Producer to help us take our content strategy to the next level and tie it all together with video content. Lots and lots of video content. We are hoping our video content will become the crown jewel—the anchor content—for which all our other content follows. We need an idea factory, a prolific video content creator, who can help us build out a cohesive strategy and deliver the goods (lots of awesome videos).</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>That’s Where You Come In:</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are looking for a Video Content Creator/Producer to help us publish regular video content and take a leadership role informing and driving content strategy overall. We are looking for someone who is comfortable being in front of the camera and can generate dozens of story ideas every day without breaking a sweat. We are looking for a storyteller—someone who can write scripts, suss out great stories, and always be looking for new ways to communicate with our customers. We need someone who can be the “talent” but also help us utilize our existing talent company-wide to develop a variety of different types of videos (live, educational, inspirational, promotional, hilarious (well, they should all be hilarious), etc.) with different goals, voices, and styles. All the video, all the time!</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Maybe you’ve been working in local news—you know how to pump out story ideas that appeal to your audience, write your own material, and build a community online. You might love this position.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Maybe you’ve been vlogging for awhile now, building an audience, honing your craft. You love the opportunity to be creative, you have so many ideas you haven’t had the chance to pursue yet, and you absolutely wish you could do it full-time.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Or maybe you are something entirely different that we haven’t dreamed up yet. Either way, we can’t wait to meet you!</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</h4></div><ul><li><span>You have experience in front of the camera.</span></li><li><span>But you don’t&nbsp;</span><em><em>need&nbsp;</em></em><span>to be in front of the camera. You are also comfortable concepting, scripting, and coordinating a video featuring someone else.</span></li><li><span>You have experience generating story ideas. In fact, you are an never-ending source of, “What if we….”, “I was thinking we should try,...”, and “You guys! I saw something that we need to put our own spin on…”. Just reading this bullet point you thought of three new ideas you want to jot down.</span></li><li><span>You never met a brainstorm you didn’t like. You get energized at the mere prospect of collaborating with our teachers, writers, designers, support reps, and marketers to create incredible video content with serious impact.</span></li><li><span>You love talking about how to “connect” with users and potential users.</span></li><li><span>You do well with vague directions like, “We need to reach more small business owners.”</span></li><li><span>You have a sense of humor—in person, on camera, in writing. Going for the joke is a natural instinct you simply can’t shut off.</span></li><li><span>You understand that creating engaging, effective content is equal parts art/science/research/timing/heart.</span></li><li><span>You understand the value of brand, and how a sound content strategy can strengthen a brand.</span></li><li><span>You are comfortable juggling, wrangling, cheering, critiquing, concepting, writing, polishing, and publishing all in a day’s work.</span></li><li><span>You’re looking for a full-time, remote gig where you will have a lot of influence, the opportunity to put your creative stamp on a new position/priority, and help lead our content strategy into a new era starring video.</span></li></ul><div><h4>You get Bonus Points if:</h4></div><ul><li><span>You use and love YNAB.</span></li><li><span>You are already creating regular video content you can show us.</span></li><li><span>You have editing and/or technical video creation experience (compositing, effects, lighting, fancy video post-production skills)</span></li></ul><div><h2><strong>How to Apply</strong></h2></div><ul><li><b>Apply here (https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk01yy8)&nbsp;by 11:59 pm on October 14th, 2018</b>.&nbsp;It’s a&nbsp;real deadline, the kind you love. </li><li><span>Attach a PDF of your cover letter.

Step one is a brief&nbsp;chat with our recruiter, then a short (1-hour) design exercise, a call with our Product lead, a call with our engineers and final round chat with our co-founders, Scott and Brian. From there we'll discuss next steps, ask for a few references and get an offer out. Total time?

If that's you and you have a portfolio to back that up, feel free to quote your hourly or project rate upfront.</p><p>Core Data currently needs an additional HTML5 web designer with react and redux experience to create a major expansion on the company's HTML5-based UI. The existing UI can be seen at this <a href='http://coredata.eu/newui' rel='nofollow'>link</a>. The existing UI is focused on displaying available offers for live (actively in play) sports games and uses a simplified navigation scheme where the user simply selects a sport, then a game, and ultimately selects what wagers are wanted.</p><p>The candidate will need to expand this User Interface to include &quot;prematch&quot; betting. Mockup designs for this have already been prepared <a href='https://coredata.eu/designer.html' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. The enhancement will keep all existing functionality of the live UI, but add a tab/screen for upcoming games that have not yet started. The list of available prematch games is numerous (sometimes in the thousands) and so the navigation scheme will be much more sophisticated than the live (current) navigation scheme. The company's goal is to have a clean, smooth, and intuitive cross-browser product.</p><p>The candidate will be expected to combine their knowledge of aesthetics and intuitive UX principles to create a cutting-edge, crisp, and attractive prematch expansion to the company's UI. The existing UI uses React.JS and Redux, so prior experience with these frameworks is necessary.

Submissions without a portfolio included will not be considered.</p>  <p></p>  <p><strong>About Us</strong></p>  <p>At Trifacta, we’re designing a product for a growing group of users who have a very real pain. Cleaning and structuring data is both a crucial and difficult activity, a process that traditionally requires a huge amount of time and effort. We believe that transforming data shouldn’t be a painful problem and that user-centered design is particularly well suited to creating simple, intuitive, and enjoyable solutions. This is a lofty goal in a space that is traditionally deprived of usable products.</p>  <p>As designers, we recognize, perhaps more than anybody else, the value of professional tools capable not only to accommodate our needs but also to empower and inspire us in our everyday work. Our mission (and our passion) is providing our users with these same great experiences. And our target users are tough ones: smart, skilled, incredibly task-driven data analysts with unique mental models. We are facing big challenges here: building modern data tools for a large variety of users and needs in a complex and incredibly dynamic context. How can we support them in the shift from spreadsheets to the complexity of big data? How can we give users the ability to understand the impact of their work across data, projects, and organizations?</p>  <p>We are looking for a talented Senior UX Designer to help us tackling these hard challenges by working from the beginning to the end of product building, from generating new ideas to crafting detailed microinteractions. You will participate in the definition of a new generation of products capable of combining user inputs and machine learning technologies to accomplish complex tasks in simple, enjoyable ways. Come be part of an incredibly passionate, talented and diverse team in which collaboration and mutual respect are key.</p>  <p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>You will articulate and convey designs via scenarios, sketches, storyboards and presentations, lo- and hi-fi mockups, detailed interaction specs, prototypes or animations.</li>   <li>You’ll drive your designs forward through every step of the design process and know what details matter at each stage: formative research, conceptual and interaction design, prototyping, and usability studies. Through this process we’d rather you show than tell.</li>   <li>You will work closely with PMs to discover and understand user needs and requirements. We hope you can help us defining what we should build, not just how to build it.</li>   <li>You will work closely with engineers to understand technical considerations and implement our designs down to the last detail.</li>   <li>You will contribute to the design, documentation and publishing of our design system.</li>   <li>Our company and processes are ever-changing, so we hope you can embrace and influence the change to make Trifacta a better place.</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>You have a minimum of 3 years of industry experience in product design with a proven track record of success. You can share several great examples of real work you’ve shipped, and what you learned along the way.</li>   <li>You’ve shipped enterprise products and you feel comfortable working with and for data, juggling technical constraints and gnarly details. You know how to work with and motivate engineers to get the fit and finish right.</li>   <li>You’re a generalist with a strong focus on UI and UX. You are passionate about building users interfaces and crafting beautiful and intuitive interactions leveraging the latest web technologies.</li>   <li>You have thorough knowledge and experience across a range of design approaches, methodologies and prototyping skills.</li>   <li>You obsess over details and are excited to polish until your work is pixel-perfect.</li>   <li>You have strong written &amp; verbal communication and presentation skills. You are able to effectively structure and share your work in an international setup with 6+ hours of time difference, frequent asynchronous communications, remote design reviews, etc..</li>   <li>You are able to manage and work on multiple projects simultaneously.</li>   <li>Our team deeply values collaboration. You are passionate and committed to working with other designers and across disciplines to drive change into products. You’re confident, but willing to learn. We want to learn from you too!</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Benefits and Perks of working at Trifacta</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>You will work on an international, friendly team on one of the most exciting opportunities in the data space.</li>   <li>We will help you grow your skills through mentorships and education support.

We build standalone, targeted SaaS products that bring great UX to solving more specific business problems.</p><p>To date, our 12-person team has shipped three products:</p><ul><li><a href='https://cx.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey CX</a> - Measure and improve customer satisfaction</li><li><a href='https://engage.surveymonkey.com/' rel='nofollow'>SurveyMonkey Engage</a> - Understand and foster employee engagement</li><li><a href='https://www.techvalidate.com/' rel='nofollow'>TechValidate</a> - Source and publish 3rd-party verified customer proof</li></ul><p>We’re on a mission to bring better design to the business world, and while we’re at it we’d like to make our mark with stunning data viz, personable interfaces, and a commitment to empathizing with our users.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Who We’re Looking For</strong></span></p><p>We’re looking for a talented designer with demonstrable experience working on user-friendly SaaS applications. Your portfolio should demonstrate the ability to design for all screen sizes from mobile to desktop. You should also be comfortable writing clear, concise UI copy.</p><p>Strong visual design, product design, usability, and communication skills are essential. Technical skills such as CSS, Javascript, and familiarity with Ruby on Rails are also a strong plus, though not required. Experience contributing to a central design system is a major plus and you will have opportunity to participate as we evolve ours.</p><p>If you’re jazzed about making really complex things super simple we should talk. If you’re interested in creating the future of intuitive data visualization (and have an opinion on what that means) we should talk. If you believe that great design belongs everywhere and have the mettle to make it happen, we should <em>definitely</em> talk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Qualifications</strong></span></p><ul><li>3+ years of experience on a product design team working across the entire product development lifecycle and successfully shipping products.</li><li>Experience working effectively with cross-functional teams including shepherding designs through the development process.</li><li>Experience collaborating with other designers to create a cohesive cross-product experience, both leveraging and contributing to a centralized design system.</li><li>Solid user-centered design fundamentals with information architecture, interaction design and visual design skills and the ability to quickly produce high quality deliverables across the range of disciplines.</li><li>Demonstrated ability to write clear, effective UI copy.</li><li>Ability to present design solutions at all levels of the organization with clear, articulate rationale.</li><li>Proficient with Sketch, Invision, Creative Suite, and knowledgeable about HTML, CSS, modern browser technologies, and cross-device design.</li><li>Portfolio showcasing examples of product design work.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span><strong>Why Work Here?</strong></span></p><p>We are a remote team. As long as your work day overlaps the Pacific timezone by at least four hours, where you live and work and up to you. We’re not strangers though — in addition to a sane amount of video calls, we meet up quarterly to get to know each other better and have some fun. In the past year, we’ve been bowling in Phoenix, made sushi in San Francisco, and toured a brewery.</p><p>We are strong believers in work-life balance. We know world class work can be done in just forty hours a week when distractions are minimized and the pace is sustainable. As such, you will be expected to be a manager of one.</p><p>Naturally, we offer competitive salaries and annual bonuses, medical/dental benefits, generous PTO, 401k, paid holidays, and meaningful equity compensation. We also supply you with top of the line equipment for your home office.</p><p>Finally, in a world of clunky “enterprise” software, we consider great UX and visual design to be a strategic advantage, and we need you to help us keep improving. Our track record gives our team a lot of autonomy — this is your chance to rethink how “business solutions” should look and function, and to have fun while doing it.</p><p>Join us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At SurveyMonkey, we offer competitive salaries, medical/dental benefits, PTO, 401k, paid holidays and parental leave, and equity compensation.</p><p>SurveyMonkey is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p>  </div>",
