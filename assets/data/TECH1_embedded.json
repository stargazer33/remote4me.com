While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.\\n\\nPeople who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.\\n\\nBalena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.\\n\\n* You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.\\n\\n* You can execute and complete software projects.\\n\\n* You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)\\n\\n* You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.\\n\\n* An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.\\n\\n* You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.\\n\\n* You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkills we’re looking for\\n\\n\\n* You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.\\n\\n* You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.\\n\\n* You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.\\n\\n* Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with\\n\\n* Experience leading a software project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBonus points for the following\\n\\n\\n* Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement\\n\\n* Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)\\n\\n* A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)\\n\\n* Having worked remotely before\\n\\n* Interest in embedded systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\n\\n* Work with extremely talented, diverse team\\n\\n* Equipment of your choice\\n\\n* Remote-friendly\\n\\n* Flexible working hours\\n\\n* Flexible vacation policy\\n\\n* Annual company gathering in an international location\\n\\n* We send you hardware for side projects!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout working at balena\\n\\nWe come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.\\n\\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.  </div> </div>",

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p>\n <p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</p>\n <p>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li>\n  <li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li>\n  <li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li>\n  <li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li>\n  <li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li>\n  <li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li>\n  <li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li>\n </ul>\n <p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p>\n <p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p>\n <p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a>\n</div>\n<div> \n</div> \n<h4>About Analytics Fire</h4> \n<div>\n <p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p>\n <p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Remote</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible Schedule</span> </li> \n</ul>",

We work holistically with our client partners as a true extension of their product team, not just as the technical execution arm of their business. If we see something broken, whether that's a workflow, a marketing or messaging strategy, or a needless feature, we speak up, and our clients trust us to help them fix it. \n  <br> \n  <br>Because we're more than just designers and developers, we achieve results that bring successful long-term partnerships and trusted referrals. We help entrepreneurs&nbsp;build a business&nbsp;not just an app. This approach, coupled with realistic and incremental software releases results in a friendly, fun, and collaborative atmosphere where our colleagues and clients both have room to learn and grow. \n  <br> \n  <br>See how our clients&nbsp;talk&nbsp;about&nbsp;our approach&nbsp;and check out some of the&nbsp;recognition we've received&nbsp;so far. Discover how we show our clients appreciation with unique&nbsp;holiday gifts&nbsp;each year. Or, if you're a podcast fan, check out&nbsp;Seaworthy, where we explore ways to help companies grow and scale their business and ideas. We're excited about what we've achieved in the last few years, but we're just getting started. We need your help to take us to the next level! \n  <br> \n  <br>A Day In The Life \n  <br> \n  <br>During a typical work week, our crew members enjoy a balanced assignment of 35 hours on client projects with the ability to invest the other 5 hours on a combination of individual goals and team meetings. Each quarter, we take a full week away from client work to focus on team goals and internal project initiatives. These weeks alternate between a retreat style destination that encourages team bonding and goal setting, and a more focused week-long design and development sprint at our primary office in Wisconsin. Check out some of our&nbsp;team&nbsp;week&nbsp;recaps&nbsp;and&nbsp;years in review&nbsp;to get a feel for how much fun it is to work at Headway! \n  <br> \n  <br>What Does Success Look Like? \n  <br> \n  <br>During your first 2-4 weeks at Headway, you'll have an opportunity to meet with lots of crew members across the company and start to understand our unique approach to product development. This includes several &quot;Headway 101&quot; sessions that cover everything from our project management style, to our design aesthetic and business analysis approach, to development tools and techniques. If you're new to one of our tech stacks, we'll also create a customized trail of exercises to help get you up to speed. This training covers fundamentals of our core technologies, the way we delegate tasks within a development team, our git process and workflow, testing strategies, tips for successful client interactions, and much more. \n  <br> \n  <br>After this initial period, you'll be successfully contributing to new feature work on a client project in the context of a team. You'll also be participating in daily standups, sprint planning meetings, and retrospectives.&nbsp;Welcome aboard! \n  <br> \n  <br>Ongoing Support \n  <br> \n  <br>Each week, you'll meet with your team lead to ensure that you have the time and attention you need to be successful. Your needs and questions will always come first in this meeting, but other topics discussed include: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Individual quarterly goal progress \n  <br> \n  <br>* Project status / team issues / weekly retro \n  <br> \n  <br>* Individual responses to our weekly team health questionnaire \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Quarterly and Annual Reviews \n  <br> \n  <br>In addition to weekly touch point meetings, more formal quarterly reviews are scheduled to discuss successes and areas for growth identified over the last 3 months. We have annual performance assessments and salary reviews, though we reserve the right to provide a merit based pay raise at any time. Most crew members achieve between a 2% and 5% raise each year within their same role, but bigger jumps are possible when roles or responsibilities increase. We're here to grow with you sustainably over the long term. \n  <br> \n  <br>Experience and Results At Every Level \n  <br> \n  <br>With an experienced leadership team encompassing design, development, sales, marketing, and operations, Headway is poised for an amazing 2019. Our business is guided by&nbsp;EOS&nbsp;and we have strong processes, documentation, and people to support your growth and development. As they say, “Train people well enough so they can leave, treat them well enough so they don't want to.” For more on that, check out our benefits! \n  <br> \n  <br>Why Should You Apply? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work on exciting projects in the latest tech across a variety of industries including: Healthcare, FinTech, Education, Personal Growth &amp; Training, Lifestyle &amp; Social \n  <br> \n  <br>* Collaborate with colleagues and clients directly to ship features that users love \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work with appreciative clients who seek out and value your input and feedback \n  <br> \n  <br>* Strong leadership and top-notch colleagues to help you realize your full potential \n  <br> \n  <br>* Career growth and leadership opportunities \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Key Benefits \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* 3 weeks of PTO &amp; Sick Time available immediately \n  <br> \n  <br>* 1 week of additional time off during the winter holiday season \n  <br> \n  <br>* 100% of health care and dental premiums paid for you and all your dependents \n  <br> \n  <br>* Up to a 4% matching 401k contribution based on your dollar contribution \n  <br> \n  <br>* $6,000 hardware on-boarding budget including $2,000 to spend however you like \n  <br> \n  <br>* $2,500 annual education and conference budget \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>The Hiring Process \n  <br> \n  <br>If after we review your application and we choose to move forward, the following interviews will typically take place over the course of 1-3 weeks (depending on scheduling): \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work history and aspirations chat with our People and Team Strategist \n  <br> \n  <br>* Skills and performance discussion with a Development Lead or the Head of Development \n  <br> \n  <br>* Take-home skills assessment with the potential for follow up / discussion / remote pairing at this stage \n  <br> \n  <br>* Group interview with several members of the design team and/or development team \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Position Description \n  <br> \n  <br>As a Developer at Headway, you are client and user focused while executing on the details of each project.

We’re looking for a senior full-stack developer with a willingness to acquire deep expertise around Ruby, Python, and React.js, in order to help us expand to support additional new high-tech sectors.</p>\n <p>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, last year we worked on a scalable IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, a sales and design tool for residential solar, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior dev to join our team.</p>\n <p>For reference, here is a list of technologies and tools we are currently actively using on a day-to-day basis:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Front-end: JavaScript / React / Angular</li>\n  <li>Back-end: Ruby / Python / Node.js</li>\n  <li>Embedded (IoT): C, Embedded Linux, MQTT</li>\n  <li>Embedded (robotics): C/C++, ROS</li>\n  <li>Modern software techniques: RESTful APIs, SOA, PaaS, etc</li>\n  <li>Agile collaboration and DevOps tools: Github, Trello, Slack, Chef, Ansible, Docker, Vagrant, etc</li>\n  <li>Occasionally we need to do a small amount of work around: SFDC, iOS, Android, ARKit</li>\n </ul>\n <p>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are in a very heavily US-overlapping time zone (eg: North America, Central America, South America, etc). We’re a really great match for a senior dev in a US-overlapping timezone who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while also having flexibility around time and geography.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></strong></p>\n <p>Ideally, you should have 5+ years commercial full stack development, ideally within a startup environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p>\n <p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a>\n</div>\n<div> \n</div> \n<h4>About Analytics Fire</h4> \n<div>\n <p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p>\n <p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. Our dream is to be able to spend our time working on interesting problems, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography and being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers.”</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Remote</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible Schedule</span> </li> \n</ul>",
