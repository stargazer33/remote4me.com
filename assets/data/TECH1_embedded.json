We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather grow than let our assumptions get in our way.  </div> </div>",

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.</p><p>People who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.</p><p>Balena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.</li><li>You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.</li><li>You can execute and complete software projects.</li><li>You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)</li><li>You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.</li><li>An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.</li><li>You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.</li><li>You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.</li></ul><p><strong>Skills we’re looking for</strong></p><ul><li>You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.</li><li>You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.</li><li>You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.</li><li>Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with</li><li>Experience leading a software project</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for the following</strong></p><ul><li>Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement</li><li>Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)</li><li>A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)</li><li>Having worked remotely before</li><li>Interest in embedded systems</li></ul><p>BENEFITS</p><ul><li>Work with extremely talented, diverse team</li><li>Equipment of your choice</li><li>Remote-friendly</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Flexible vacation policy</li><li>Annual company gathering in an international location</li><li>We send you hardware for side projects!</li></ul><p><strong>About working at balena</strong></p><p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://workable.com/j/299979DA26' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Balena</h4>            <div><p>Balena's mission to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT fleet owners.

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.\\n\\nPeople who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.\\n\\nBalena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better.

We are building a safe, digital audio platform made for kids from the ground up, and featuring a curated library of music, stories, radio, podcasts and learning activities for children aged 2-8. Yoto features its own carefully connected smart speaker that children control with physical cards.\n<br>\n<br>Designed by families for families and inspired by Montessori principles, Yoto gives youngsters autonomy over what they listen to or play – from their favourite nursery rhymes to learning the alphabet through phonics, and provides an exciting alternative to excessive screen time.\n<br>\n<br>Yoto launched its first hardware product on &quot;Kickstarter&quot;:https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yoto/yoto-a-clever-speaker-for-kids in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and has won a Red Dot Design award. The product shipped for Christmas 2018 to a great customer reaction. We have already partnered with the Roald Dahl company - to create new content based on his classic stories - as well as publishers including Hachette, HarperCollins, Naxos, StoryNory and more. Luke Kelly, grandson of Roald Dahl and MD of the Roald Dahl Story Company, is on our board.\n<br>\n<br>*About us*\n<br>We’re a small, creative team with a passion for technology, education, music, audiobooks and podcasts. We’ve built companies at scale before (dotmusic - sold to Yahoo, 7digital - IPO in 2014, Bouncepad, and Frukt - sold to Interpublic) and we’re bringing that experience to the world of audio entertainment and learning for children.\n<br>\n<br>As a start-up, we don’t revel in office politics and endless meetings, giving you more time to get on with the more fun part of the job. We all love what we do.\n<br>\n<br>*The position*\n<br>We’re looking for experienced FreeRTOS developer to be in charge of design and development of firmware and apps running on Yoto players.\n<br>\n<br>We strongly value a healthy work-life balance. You will work from our London office (Rocketspace, Angel, Islington) with flexible working hours and optional remote days to fit your lifestyle and family (most of the team has kids).\n<br>\n<br>*You’ll need*\n<br>* Experience developing C/C++ embedded code for ESP32 or similar microcontroller based systems\n<br>* Excellent system level knowledge of FreeRTOS \n<br>* Confidence with debugging code in an embedded system\n<br>* Agile approach - CI/CD and fully automated testing of developed modules and systems\n<br>* Experience with cloud based IoT platforms, OTA updates, pub/sub messaging \n<br>* Good knowledge of IoT/HW protocols and interfaces - BT/BLE, RFID/NFC, WiFi; SPI, I2S, I2C,...\n<br>* Familiarity with electronics principles &amp; design\n<br>* Solid understanding of security best practices\n<br>\n<br>We’re a very small team so you’ll get a chance to play with plenty of different things all the time - bonus points for any experience or desire to dig into any of the following:\n<br>\n<br>* Javascript/Node.js development\n<br>* Designing and building REST and/or GraphQL APIs\n<br>* SQL and NoSQL databases\n<br>* Cloud based infrastructures (AWS), serverless deployment, Docker\n<br>* AI/Machine learning, Big Data\n<br>\n<br>*Compensation*\n<br>* Full-time, part-time or freelance\n<br>* Competitive salary and equity (tax-efficient EMI share options)\n<br>\n<br>*Benefits*\n<br>* Generous holidays\n<br>* Remote working \n<br>* Workplace pension\n<br>\n<br>Drop us an email with your CV and/or links to your linkedin/github/etc profile(s).\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>",
