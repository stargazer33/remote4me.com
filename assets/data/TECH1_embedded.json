While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.\\n\\nPeople who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.\\n\\nBalena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.\\n\\n* You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.\\n\\n* You can execute and complete software projects.\\n\\n* You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)\\n\\n* You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.\\n\\n* An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.\\n\\n* You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.\\n\\n* You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkills we’re looking for\\n\\n\\n* You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.\\n\\n* You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.\\n\\n* You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.\\n\\n* Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with\\n\\n* Experience leading a software project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBonus points for the following\\n\\n\\n* Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement\\n\\n* Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)\\n\\n* A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)\\n\\n* Having worked remotely before\\n\\n* Interest in embedded systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\n\\n* Work with extremely talented, diverse team\\n\\n* Equipment of your choice\\n\\n* Remote-friendly\\n\\n* Flexible working hours\\n\\n* Flexible vacation policy\\n\\n* Annual company gathering in an international location\\n\\n* We send you hardware for side projects!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout working at balena\\n\\nWe come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.\\n\\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better.

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.</p><p>People who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.</p><p>Balena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.</li><li>You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.</li><li>You can execute and complete software projects.</li><li>You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)</li><li>You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.</li><li>An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.</li><li>You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.</li><li>You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.</li></ul><p><strong>Skills we’re looking for</strong></p><ul><li>You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.</li><li>You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.</li><li>You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.</li><li>Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with</li><li>Experience leading a software project</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for the following</strong></p><ul><li>Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement</li><li>Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)</li><li>A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)</li><li>Having worked remotely before</li><li>Interest in embedded systems</li></ul><p>BENEFITS</p><ul><li>Work with extremely talented, diverse team</li><li>Equipment of your choice</li><li>Remote-friendly</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Flexible vacation policy</li><li>Annual company gathering in an international location</li><li>We send you hardware for side projects!</li></ul><p><strong>About working at balena</strong></p><p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://workable.com/j/299979DA26' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Balena</h4>            <div><p>Balena's mission to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT fleet owners.

We’re looking for a senior embedded developer with deep experience developing, testing, and debugging embedded software in a Linux environment to help us expand our services to support manufacturers in additional new high-tech sectors. \n  <br> \n  <br>Analytics Fire is a small, distributed team working on a range of interesting projects. For example, we recently helped build a custom IoT platform for utility grade solar power plants, sales software for residential solar systems, and a machine-learning powered autonomous cleaning robot. We’re looking for a fun, reliable, and highly collaborative, senior developer to join our team. \n  <br> \n  <br>This is a remote position. We’re flexible about location and hours, so long as your working hours are within a European or US-overlapping time zone. We’re a really great match for a senior developer who wants to work hard on interesting projects, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>**Skills &amp; Requirements** \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Ideally, you should have 5+ years developing, testing, and debugging embedded software in a Linux environment. You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies. \n  <br> \n  <br>Required skills: \n  <br> \n  <br>- Expert level experience developing, testing and debugging embedded software in a Linux environment \n  <br>- Development experience using Python, C, and C++ \n  <br>- Basic hardware experience (cabling, basic troubleshooting) \n  <br>- Basic understanding of web technology \n  <br>- Strong verbal and written communication skills \n  <br> \n  <br>Nice to have: \n  <br> \n  <br>- Expert-level network systems experience using connman, BTLE, and dbus \n  <br>- Expert-level experience with wireless protocols (eg zigbee, cellular modem, etc) \n  <br>- Intermediate or expert level security engineering experience with current knowledge of security best practices, common exploits, and threat landscape \n  <br>- Previous experience creating custom Linux-based systems using Yocto \n  <br> \n  <br>Analytics Fire has a very polyglot technical culture. Our ideal candidate has expert-level skills in the above categories, but also have a secondary skill set in one of the following areas: \n  <br> \n  <br>- Full stack software engineering with React, Angular \n  <br>- Scientific computing with C++ and/or Python \n  <br>- Computer vision / machine learning (PhD-level) \n  <br>- DevOps automation \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>**About Analytics Fire** \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of engineering nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups. \n  <br> \n  <br>“Our goal founding Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for. For us this meant being able to spend our time working on the hardest and most interesting technical problems that we could find, being part of a small, tightly-knit team of world-class engineers, while simultaneously having flexibility around time and geography.” \n </div> \n</div>",
