Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Senior* *Hardware* *Engineer*.<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />As a senior hardware engineer, it will be your responsibility to design a new hardware platform. In your role, you will be involved in all aspects of EE hardware design including system definition, board circuit design, validation, approvals and New Product Introduction.<br /><br />You will be working on a new hardware platform that comprises an ARM microcontroller, sensors, and advanced radio communications. You will interface with multiple teams including but not limited to the embedded software team, the cloud software team and the algorithm team to design the most suitable solution for an overall eco-system. In addition, you will contribute to the development of production test equipment to enable testing of the hardware when the product goes into production. The role also offers the opportunity to write embedded software for inclusion in Switchee products and in production test equipment.<br /><br />We are looking for someone with drive and a creative mind capable of solving complex problems in a neat, simple and reliable fashion. To be successful you need to be highly motivated and detail oriented while showing highest standards of responsibilities.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Your* *experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places – but we wouldn’t be surprised if the person who gets this role has:<br /><br />* Master/bachelor degree in electrical engineering from a leading university<br />* 5+ years of experience in consumer product design<br />* 5+ years of experience with system level design including circuit design, system bring up, integration & debug<br />* Knowledge of processor architecture, digital circuit design and comms protocols such as I2C, UART, SPI<br />* Knowledge of mixed-signal board level design<br />* Experience developing robust designs for ESD/EMI immunities and RF de-sensitization<br />* Experience integrating RF technologies such as radio/GSM<br />* Experience leading and driving design development from schematic capture, PCB layout through assembly<br />* Must enjoy being hands-on in the lab and want to be in the details (soldering, oscilloscopes, data acquisition)<br />* Experience with Altium, Cadence, OrCAD, or Allegro<br />* Experience working with typical IoT communication protocol like BT, Zigbee, ZWave or Sub-GHz comms<br />* Experience of writing low level embedded software would be advantageous<br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br /><br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We often work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter on Careers page. "
