You’ll document and describe all the technical capabilities of the platform in a clear, digestible format. In other words, you’ll become the world’s foremost expert on all things balena!\\n\\nThe documentation and internal knowledge base of solutions will be yours to design and maintain. You will create and organize this content, making sure it is synced, up-to-date, and easy for external and internal developers to quickly find the information they need.\\n\\nYou will be a critical element in balena’s [support driven development philosophy](https://www.balena.io/blog/support-driven-development/), helping the support engineers be more efficient and accurate. You will be integral in recognizing knowledge gaps in our user base but also in our team.\\n\\nYou will work cross functionally with Engineering, Product Management and Sales.

You can be incredibly productive without much oversight and know where your time is best spent.\\n\\n* Skilled at learning and teaching new technical concepts. You don’t need to be a developer per se, but you do need to be able to build a thorough understanding of balena products and teach others about our technologies.\\n\\n* You believe positive user experiences are critical to success and love helping customers tackle technical problems\\n\\n* Able to understand the product from a user’s perspective and explain features in a way that users will appreciate.\\n\\n* Fluent in written and spoken English\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNice to have:\\n\\n\\n* Experience working as a developer, particularly with JavaScript, HTML, and Linux\\n\\n* Experience building IoT and/or hardware projects.

To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.\\n\\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diverse backgrounds. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather grow than let our assumptions get in our way.  </div> </div>",

You should be comfortable autonomously driving your own high quality / high velocity contributions using a range of technologies.</p><p>We work with a variety of technologies, but are currently specifically looking for someone that has or can obtain expert level skills around Python, Ruby, and React.js.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/136187?reset=False&amp;ra=JFIBXryxPKo&amp;oqs=a%3DJFIBXryxPKo%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h4>About Analytics Fire</h4>            <div><p>Analytics Fire was founded by a couple of data-nerds -- one a PHd in machine learning and the other a former VP of Engineering for an analytics platform -- who both are also serial entrepreneurs backed by prominent angels and VCs including Y Combinator and 500 Startups.</p><p>“Our goal founding, Analytics Fire, was to create the engineering department that we always dreamed of working for.

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.</p><p>People who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.</p><p>Balena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have extremely good problem-solving abilities.

To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better.
