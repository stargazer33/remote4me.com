Universe is built to empower everyone to create their own home on the internet.<br><br>We're looking for an iOS developer to help accelerate our mission. You'll take on tasks throughout the stack. You will expand the editor: adding new block types, more complex layouts, and more customizations for each block. You will help build tools that are easy for everyone to understand, so that buying a domain, setting up metadata, and adding pages are super simple. And you will advance our Magic Builder, a personalized design “assistant” that generates a unique site by asking you just a few questions. <br><br>Our app is native, taking advantage of the many frameworks Apple gives us. It is built entirely with Swift. The bulk of the user data is stored in CloudKit though we do maintain a few of our own APIs. We're hoping to convert those APIs from node.js to Swift soon, so experience with Vapor or Kitura is a bonus ;). We use programatic autolayout for the majority of our UI. We do believe in Unit Tests, but we don't have enough yet.<br><br>This is a full time position and 100% remote. Experience working remotely is definitely a bonus. We offer health benefits and generous vacation because everyone needs to recharge their batteries.<br><br>We're looking for someone sharp, internally-driven, and passionate about building powerful tools for everyone.&nbsp;</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/195634?reset=False&amp;ra=13BNd2T27N4Y&amp;oqs=a%3D13BNd2T27N4Y' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Universe</h3>            <div><p>Universe&nbsp;is the first website builder designed for mobile.
