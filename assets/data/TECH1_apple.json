Everyone's voice is heard, and we strongly believe in the&nbsp;value&nbsp;of being part of an&nbsp;inclusive and&nbsp;diverse team that works closely together.</p><p>The&nbsp;size of our team is small enough to allow everyone to be equally involved and have a clear view of the big picture. We won’t bore you with a single never-ending subtask of a subtask. Meetings and interruptions are always kept to a minimum. We want to you to do work that matters and work that you are proud of.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who we're looking for</strong></p><p>We're looking&nbsp;for team members that are enjoy&nbsp;working on all the aspects of developing&nbsp;and evolving an iOS app.&nbsp;From the deep inner workings of the application’s backend architecture and scaling to polishing the animations of the UI and working with our support team to diagnose an issue that a user is having. We require at least 3 years of iOS development experience&nbsp;and you must be able to show at least one real-world project where you have made a significant contribution.</p><p>It's important to know that we're&nbsp;looking for a full-time exclusive collaboration that will last for years and evolve over time.

After that each member of team will be working on their assigned tasks alone or in coordination with other members of the team developing new features, squashing bugs, prototyping, updating the UI or experimenting with new technologies or the next crazy idea that might change the world.</p><p>We practice Agile development and plan our work on a&nbsp;fifteen-day sprints so there will be regular meetings every second Monday, Thursday and Friday to start a new sprint, plan ahead and show the rest of the team what has be done. There are very few other meetings during the sprint because we have actual work to do ;) That's it!</p><p><strong>What we offer</strong></p><p>We offer a great salary, paid vacation time, financial support for opportunities that will help you grow as professional&nbsp;and&nbsp;we reward every team member with additional bonuses and benefits for outstanding work and personal or team goals achieved.</p><p>If that sounds like what you're looking for, just apply for the position and we'll reach to set up a meeting to get to know you better.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/276716?reset=False&amp;ra=1uNIKvCk9BHa&amp;oqs=a%3D1uNIKvCk9BHa' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>",

And we do that across multiple clients - each and every one we're excited to work with.</p><p>Because we believe in constant learning and exploring - whether that’s a new skill, a new role, or a new way of seeing.&nbsp; And because we've found that we learn the most when we take on new challenges as a team.&nbsp; We’re happy that people love working with us (and still have lives outside of work).

    "content": "<span><h2>iOS Engineer</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>Heetch</h3></span> <div>  <div>   <br>Read before applying:   <br>   <br>We're a young company iterating over our remote culture so for now, we're only working with people in locations where the time zone is:&nbsp;-3 hours &gt; Paris time zone&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;+3 hours   <br>   <br>Marketplace Team @Heetch   <br>   <br>We focus on finding the right triggers to balance demand (passenger requests) and supply (driver availabilities) to generate growth while maintaining a highly reliable service. It requires a lot of data work, in order to formulate hypotheses and create models which will fit the different cities we operate in. In other words, we try to build scalable and smart things to make mobility easier, for both drivers and passengers. Our team's ultimate goal is to do everything we can so anyone can Heetch at any time.   <br>   <br>Mindset   <br>   <br>   <br>* Move fast not furious.   <br>   <br>* Don’t be scared of failure, learn from it and try again.   <br>   <br>* Unit and functional tests are as important as code.   <br>   <br>* Code is always evolving we do not think in versions.   <br>   <br>* We’re not just here to push code, product ownerships equally spread amongst the team.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Our team's values   <br>   <br>   <br>* Work wherever you want: We’ve always been remote first but also have shiny offices in Paris, London, Brussels and Casablanca.   <br>   <br>* Open communication: Everything is public within the team.   <br>   <br>* You are not alone: We use Slack and video calls every day.   <br>   <br>* Promulgate Knowledge: Whether it's organizational, cultural or technical, we're eager to learn!   <br>   <br>* Continuous improvement: We do weekly team retrospectives and have a strong Speak Up value.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>What will be your role?   <br>   <br>You will improve the ride flow on both the passengers and drivers side by making it more modular to improve its scalability. Due to our expansion in new countries, you will have to build a product that can adapt and deal with both technical and cultural challenges.   <br>   <br>Does it sound like you?   <br>   <br>   <br>* You have more than 5 years of experience in iOS development.   <br>   <br>* You also have at least 2 years of experience in using Reactive programming.   <br>   <br>* You've already worked with Swift in Production.   <br>   <br>* You understand the iOS SDK and application lifecycle.   <br>   <br>* You've got knowledge in common architectural patterns.   <br>   <br>* You're skilled in UI using ConstraintLayout.   <br>   <br>* You're thorough when it comes to test coverage and other best practices.   <br>   <br>* If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.   <br>   <br>* If you know about managing the lifecycle of background services and their impact on battery usage, it would also be a bonus.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>What will you do?   <br>   <br>   <br>* Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Scientist teams to build highly impactful features   <br>   <br>* Optimise performance and help to solve technical and product problems for our large pool of iOS users   <br>   <br>* Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your co-workers   <br>   <br>* Have the freedom to experiment. Intrigued in new tech or library? Go for it! let's see how it improves our app.   <br>   <br>* Be a key member of the wider iOS team at Heetch and contribute to core architecture and design discussions   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>What are going to be your challenges?   <br>   <br>Our app is one, of the few mobile apps, running in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.   <br>   <br>   <br>* Network and GPS management: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.   <br>   <br>* UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.   <br>   <br>* One way data flow and functional pattern: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>What's next?&nbsp;   <br>   <br>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps:   <br>   <br>* Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30)   <br>   <br>* Take home assignment (~5 days deadline)   <br>   <br>* Interview with your future teammates (1h)   <br>   <br>* Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Check out our&nbsp;Engineering Blog&nbsp;and follow our&nbsp;twitter&nbsp;:) You can also have a look at our open-source projects and contributions&nbsp;here  </div> </div>",

It requires a lot of data work, in order to formulate hypotheses and create models which will fit the different cities we operate in. In other words, we try to build scalable and smart things to make mobility easier, for both drivers and passengers. Our team's ultimate goal is to do everything we can so anyone can Heetch at any time.</p><p><strong>Mindset</strong></p><ul><li>Move fast not furious. </li><li>Don’t be scared of failure, learn from it and try again.</li><li>Unit and functional tests are as important as code.</li><li>Code is always evolving we do not think in versions.</li><li>We’re not just here to push code, product ownerships equally spread amongst the team.</li></ul><p><strong>Our team's values</strong></p><ul><li>Work wherever you want: We’ve always been remote first but also have shiny offices in Paris, London, Brussels and Casablanca.</li><li>Open communication: Everything is public within the team.</li><li>You are not alone: We use Slack and video calls every day.</li><li>Promulgate Knowledge: Whether it's organizational, cultural or technical, we're eager to learn!</li><li>Continuous improvement: We do weekly team retrospectives and have a strong Speak Up value.</li></ul><p><strong>What will be your role?</strong></p><p>You will improve the ride flow on both the passengers and drivers side by making it more modular to improve its scalability. Due to our expansion in new countries, you will have to build a product that can adapt and deal with both technical and cultural challenges.</p><p><strong>Does it sound like you?</strong></p><ul><li>You have more than 5 years of experience in iOS development.</li><li>You also have at least 2 years of experience in using Reactive programming.</li><li>You've already worked with Swift in Production.</li><li>You understand the iOS SDK and application lifecycle.</li><li>You've got knowledge in common architectural patterns.</li><li>You're skilled in UI using ConstraintLayout.</li><li>You're thorough when it comes to test coverage and other best practices.</li><li>If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.</li><li>If you know about managing the lifecycle of background services and their impact on battery usage, it would also be a bonus.</li></ul><p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p><ul><li>Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Scientist teams to build highly impactful features</li><li>Optimise performance and help to solve technical and product problems for our large pool of iOS users</li><li>Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your co-workers</li><li>Have the freedom to experiment.

This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li>Network and GPS management: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li><li>UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li><li>One way data flow and functional pattern: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>What's next?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps:</p><ol><li>Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30)</li><li>Take home assignment (~5 days deadline)</li><li>Interview with your future teammates (1h)</li><li>Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders</li></ol><p>Check out our<a href='https://eng.heetch.com/' rel='nofollow'>&nbsp;Engineering Blog</a>&nbsp;and follow our&nbsp;<a href='https://twitter.com/heetcheng' rel='nofollow'>twitter</a>&nbsp;:) You can also have a look at our open-source projects and contributions&nbsp;<a href='https://oss.heetch.com/' rel='nofollow'>here</a></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/heetch/81fbc2aa-ec0a-4cae-b491-19dd066dbaf9?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=StackOverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Heetch</h3>            <div><p>Heetch is a mobility app with a simple mission: We want people to enjoy going out.<br>Every night and every day, our drivers are doing their best to make their rides unforgettable and friendly!
