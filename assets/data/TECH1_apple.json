Everyone's voice is heard, and we strongly believe in the&nbsp;value&nbsp;of being part of an&nbsp;inclusive and&nbsp;diverse team that works closely together.</p>\n <p>The&nbsp;size of our team is small enough to allow everyone to be equally involved and have a clear view of the big picture. We won’t bore you with a single never-ending subtask of a subtask. Meetings and interruptions are always kept to a minimum. We want to you to do work that matters and work that you are proud of.&nbsp;</p>\n <p><strong>Who we're looking for</strong></p>\n <p>We're looking&nbsp;for team members that are enjoy&nbsp;working on all the aspects of developing&nbsp;and evolving an iOS app.&nbsp;From the deep inner workings of the application’s backend architecture and scaling to polishing the animations of the UI and working with our support team to diagnose an issue that a user is having. We require at least 3 years of iOS development experience&nbsp;and you must be able to show at least one real-world project where you have made a significant contribution.</p>\n <p>It's important to know that we're&nbsp;looking for a full-time exclusive collaboration that will last for years and evolve over time. Don't apply for this position if you are a freelance developer searching&nbsp;for a side&nbsp;project to work on for the next few months and move on to the next one.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>Skills and expertise that we require:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>At least 3 years of iOS development experience using&nbsp;Swift and Objective-C&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Experience working with UIKit, Core Animation, GCD, Core Data and WatchKit.</li>\n  <li>Experience working with Git version control and Unit testing.</li>\n  <li>Experience in performance profiling with Instruments on Xcode.</li>\n  <li>Comfortable working and communicating in English, both in writing and speaking.</li>\n  <li>Willingness to learn and experiment with new technologies.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>A day at Neybox</strong></p>\n <p>All team members start their day with a quick five-minute report of what they intend to do&nbsp;work on and what has been their progress so far to help us coordinate and prioritise. After that each member of team will be working on their assigned tasks alone or in coordination with other members of the team developing new features, squashing bugs, prototyping, updating the UI or experimenting with new technologies or the next crazy idea that might change the world.</p>\n <p>We practice Agile development and plan our work on a&nbsp;fifteen-day sprints so there will be regular meetings every second Monday, Thursday and Friday to start a new sprint, plan ahead and show the rest of the team what has be done. There are very few other meetings during the sprint because we have actual work to do ;) That's it!</p>\n <p><strong>What we offer</strong></p>\n <p>We offer a great salary, paid vacation time, financial support for opportunities that will help you grow as professional&nbsp;and&nbsp;we reward every team member with additional bonuses and benefits for outstanding work and personal or team goals achieved.</p>\n <p>If that sounds like what you're looking for, just apply for the position and we'll reach to set up a meeting to get to know you better.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/276716?reset=False&amp;ra=1uNIKvCk9BHa&amp;oqs=a%3D1uNIKvCk9BHa' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a>\n</div>\n<div> \n</div>",
