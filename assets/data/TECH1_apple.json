Build with long term maintainability in mind. Follow design patterns, but only when they’re useful. Think clearly and tell us when we’re wrong.</p><p>The apps are written in Objective-C and Swift, with a little C thrown in. You’ll need to understand memory management. Analyze performance with instruments. Write unit tests. Argue with us about git clients. Have an opinion on vi – or not :).</p><p>But above all, maintain empathy towards the users. Produce something excellent. Care about your work.</p><p>This is a coding position, but it’s not entry-level. We’re after someone with solid development experience, but it doesn’t have to be on iOS/Mac platforms. If you’ve never programmed in Swift/Objective-C/Cocoa before, that’s fine. We care much more about general abilities than knowledge of specific frameworks. But then you have to show us that you’re the kind of person who learns a new programming language over breakfast. Tell us what awesome things you’ve done in the past, and send us some sample code that shows off your abilities.</p><p>If you do have prior experience with Cocoa, even better! Tell us about the apps you’ve worked on and send us some code that you’re proud of. Alternatively – or additionally – you’re invited to download our&nbsp;<a href='https://culturedcode.com/frozen/2018/08/Tasks.zip' rel='nofollow'>sample project</a>, follow the instructions inside, and then send us your refactored work.</p><p>Our office is in Stuttgart, so if you’re looking for an opportunity to spend some time in the heart of Europe, fantastic, we have a desk waiting for you! Otherwise working remotely (and visiting us a few times a year) would be completely fine, too.</p><p>Ultimately, Cultured Code is a place where you’ll have an opportunity to do something excellent, and we aim to employ people who want to strive for that as part of a team. If you share our values and have a great skill-set then we hope you’ll get in touch!</p><p>We’re accepting applications until September 16.</p><p>—</p><h4><strong>COMPANY INFO</strong></h4><p>At Cultured Code, we’re passionate about productivity, simplicity, and beautiful design. Things is our award-winning combination of these three interests into one fine product. Last year we launched Things 3, and it’s been a resounding success. Things has won its second Apple Design Award, and has seen six major updates in the past year. We’re now looking to expand our team to keep up the pace.</p><p>Our company is based out of Stuttgart, in southern Germany, and currently consists of seven people. We’re a truly international team, hailing from Germany, Poland, Australia, Brazil, and Canada. Our company language is English.</p><p>It’s an exciting time to be at Cultured Code – we have some great plans for the future, and challenging things to work on. We hope you’ll consider joining our team, and being part of our story.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://cultured-code.breezy.hr/p/464ee8c1ade901-ios-macos-developer?source=remoteco' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Universe is built to empower everyone to create their own home on the internet.<br><br>We're looking for an iOS developer to help accelerate our mission. You'll take on tasks throughout the stack. You will expand the editor: adding new block types, more complex layouts, and more customizations for each block. You will help build tools that are easy for everyone to understand, so that buying a domain, setting up metadata, and adding pages are super simple. And you will advance our Magic Builder, a personalized design “assistant” that generates a unique site by asking you just a few questions. <br><br>Our app is native, taking advantage of the many frameworks Apple gives us. It is built entirely with Swift. The bulk of the user data is stored in CloudKit though we do maintain a few of our own APIs. We're hoping to convert those APIs from node.js to Swift soon, so experience with Vapor or Kitura is a bonus ;). We use programatic autolayout for the majority of our UI. We do believe in Unit Tests, but we don't have enough yet.<br><br>This is a full time position and 100% remote. Experience working remotely is definitely a bonus. We offer health benefits and generous vacation because everyone needs to recharge their batteries.<br><br>We're looking for someone sharp, internally-driven, and passionate about building powerful tools for everyone.&nbsp;</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/195634?reset=False&amp;ra=13BNd2T27N4Y&amp;oqs=a%3D13BNd2T27N4Y' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Universe</h3>            <div><p>Universe&nbsp;is the first website builder designed for mobile.
