We are Day Job, two former friends and current business partners who together make up possibly the most atypical tech headhunting shop the world has ever seen.</p>  <p>We’re growing, and we’re looking for someone who wants something more (autonomy, variety, freedom), and something less (meetings, reporting, workplace theatre). On the outside, you’re a full-cycle recruiter with 2-3 years of experience, confident in your sourcing and client management skills. You’ll be the main point of contact for clients and be responsible for sourcing and building your own pipeline of candidates for a few roles at a time, from screening to submission. On the inside, you’re conscientious, pragmatic, motivated, and structured, and feel excited about collaborating with a small group but also working efficiently on your own and taking back some of your life from the traditional 40-hour work week.</p>  <p>You should have experience with and opinions about recruiting processes, quality of feedback, and interviewing best practices. You should feel comfortable sourcing for the typical roles in design, product management, and engineering found in internet tech companies.</p>  <p>If you’re interested please send over a CV and if you want, a quick 1-minute audio message about yourself to <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span> and we’ll get back to you.</p>  <p><strong>About us:</strong></p>  <p>While it was always our dream to start our own boutique search firm, we deferred… honing our chops at places like SoundCloud, Square, Pinterest, and Amazon. Despite the fancy pedigree, we’ve always approached recruitment a bit differently. We talk to people like they’re people, keep things simple, connect quality with quality, and generally just live the dolce vita. As a small company, we’ve built our reputation and business on our networks and word of mouth. We don’t do marketing and aren’t looking to take over the world. We’re selective about our clients, only working with those who we feel are good people and make or offer interesting and healthy products and services.&nbsp; We have core weekly working hours where we’re together in our office in Moabit. The rest is when and where you want. We’re also flexible on comp, from a traditional fixed salary to a commission-based plan, or a combination of the two depending on your risk-reward profile. We have generous vacation allowances and creative remote working opportunities. We’re flattered if you want to move across the world to work for Day Job, however, we can’t support a visa or relocation.</p> </div><span>Apply for this position</span>",
