You are a self-starter and are always looking for ways to innovate your practice and challenge ‘standard’ ways of doing things.</p>  <p><strong>THE ROLE:</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>Identification, engagement and recruitment of the best talent in the market across Software Development, Product Management, Project Management and UX/UI – both freelance and fulltime.</li>   <li>Develop and own end-to-end process management, ensuring all candidates have a great experience throughout, irrespective of the outcome.</li>   <li>Work alongside management to build authentic employer branding, driving consistent inbound interest from the best profiles across our key markets.</li>   <li>Work with marketing to proactively spot content &amp; event opportunities to drive our reputation forward as a key player in the digital landscape</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>YOUR PROFILE:</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>You have solid experience recruiting for technical positions across development, product &amp; UX/UI – your knowledge allows you to quickly determine a truly skilled candidate without relying on ‘keywords’ or script-like questioning.</li>   <li>You understand the competitive nature of the market and have developed your own approach to address this.</li>   <li>You’re interested in what you’re building – as the first point of contact to potential talent, you’re able to properly articulate the mission because you’re passionate about what you do.
