We've done a lot to make the interview experience better for all stakeholders that I could write whole essays about, but suffice it to say that candidates love working with us, clients love working with us, and we're well-funded and growing quickly as a result.</p><p>Because of this quickly-growing demand, we're looking to hire more Expert Interviewers. The ideal candidate is a software engineer with strong written and verbal English skills with at least a few years of professional experience. Interviewing experience would be great, but we spend 25 hours (paid) training you before you even start, so if you're strong technically and love working with people we can usually make it work :) Interviews are conducted over video chat, using a collaborative code editor.</p><p>Some of our interviewers are freelancers who use our scheduling model to backfill hours; others are full timers at top tech companies looking to make some extra cash; others have quit their jobs to work with us full time; some are digital nomads; one of our interviewers is road tripping around North America for a year and a half, doing anywhere from zero to 40 interviews each week depending on where he is and what the weather's like.</p><p>The application form is here: <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/karat/d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced64c86?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source=HNWH' rel='nofollow'>https://jobs.lever.co/karat/d44ab283-c7c0-4bbd-b8c3-4dc0ced6...</a></p><p>I know it's a pretty unique job, so if you have any questions reply here or email me at josh@karat.io and I'm happy to talk through any of it.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>",
