We are Day Job, two former friends and current business partners who together make up possibly the most atypical tech headhunting shop the world has ever seen.</p>  <p>We’re growing, and we’re looking for someone who wants something more (autonomy, variety, freedom), and something less (meetings, reporting, workplace theatre). On the outside, you’re a full-cycle recruiter with 2-3 years of experience, confident in your sourcing and client management skills. You’ll be the main point of contact for clients and be responsible for sourcing and building your own pipeline of candidates for a few roles at a time, from screening to submission. On the inside, you’re conscientious, pragmatic, motivated, and structured, and feel excited about collaborating with a small group but also working efficiently on your own and taking back some of your life from the traditional 40-hour work week.</p>  <p>You should have experience with and opinions about recruiting processes, quality of feedback, and interviewing best practices. You should feel comfortable sourcing for the typical roles in design, product management, and engineering found in internet tech companies.</p>  <p>If you’re interested please send over a CV and if you want, a quick 1-minute audio message about yourself to <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span> and we’ll get back to you.</p>  <p><strong>About us:</strong></p>  <p>While it was always our dream to start our own boutique search firm, we deferred… honing our chops at places like SoundCloud, Square, Pinterest, and Amazon. Despite the fancy pedigree, we’ve always approached recruitment a bit differently. We talk to people like they’re people, keep things simple, connect quality with quality, and generally just live the dolce vita. As a small company, we’ve built our reputation and business on our networks and word of mouth. We don’t do marketing and aren’t looking to take over the world. We’re selective about our clients, only working with those who we feel are good people and make or offer interesting and healthy products and services.&nbsp; We have core weekly working hours where we’re together in our office in Moabit. The rest is when and where you want. We’re also flexible on comp, from a traditional fixed salary to a commission-based plan, or a combination of the two depending on your risk-reward profile. We have generous vacation allowances and creative remote working opportunities. We’re flattered if you want to move across the world to work for Day Job, however, we can’t support a visa or relocation.</p> </div><span>Apply for this position</span>",

We’re aiming to change the landscape of modern web development. As a part of that mission, we created Netlify CMS, an open source React app for managing static content via Git APIs.</p><p><strong>About the role</strong></p><p>We’re looking for an experienced Software Engineer to work across the Netlify CMS ecosystem, but especially on the core project and first-party extensions. Since Netlify CMS runs in the browser, the project is mostly frontend, but it integrates with static site generators written in many languages/frameworks, like Node, Ruby, and Go, so backend experience helps. Netlify CMS has a enthusiastic and growing community, so this role involves plenty of interaction and support, as well as some developer relations.</p><p>You like to work on the user experience side of development – you’re not necessarily a designer (although it’s awesome if you are!), but you know how to make highly usable interfaces that look and feel great. You love innovating in a new space, as we’re often problem-solving around how to do traditionally server-side operations from the browser. You should love building tools for other developers, and enjoy the balance between writing great code and shipping at startup speed. Finally, you’re okay wearing a few hats, and can maintain focus going between writing code, supporting the community, and doing a bit of developer relations.</p><p>Our core tools at Netlify are React and Redux with a dash of Webpack and a whiff of Babel, but it’s more important that you have a solid foundation as a web developer and a good sense of architecture and clean code. Frameworks and tools come and go, but the fundamentals stay the same.</p><p><strong>Our ideal candidate</strong></p><ul><li>Enjoys creating polished user experiences</li><li>Has experience working on products from top to bottom</li><li>Is comfortable designing interfaces (again, doesn’t have to be a designer per se)</li><li>Is a strong self-starter</li><li>Enjoys helping others solve problems</li><li>Has 4 or more years experience in a software engineer / developer role</li><li>Has expert knowledge of modern JavaScript</li><li>Has experience with modern build tooling</li><li>Loves a Git-centric workflow with continuous deployment and solid tooling</li><li>Is unafraid of digging into new tools, frameworks, and platforms</li><li>Thrives in an environment where experimentation and failure are celebrated</li><li>Gives and receives feedback with regard for both emotional and technical concerns</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/netlify/jobs/4390459002' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
