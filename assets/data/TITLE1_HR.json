With a curiosity to break things, we're a tribe of doers determined to reinvent recruitment. Together, we help transformational brands scale sustainably through building a culture-first approach to recruitment.\n<br>\n<br>Our team has experienced the world of sales-driven recruitment and have always begged the question - there’s got to be another way? We wanted to make partners out of clients and friends out of our candidates. We couldn’t find one, so we built it. Now we’re in a world we love and we’re here to stay. We’re not working in recruitment; we’re working on it. Our model provides scaling businesses, like ourselves, with the unique support they need to develop their rapidly growing team. Our ongoing collabs include Trouva, Hello Fresh, Tech Nation, Feast It, Chip, flatfair and many more... \n<br>\n<br>Think of us as the Spotify for hiring; you can start, pause or stop at any time.\n<br>\n<br> \n<br>*About the role...*\n<br>\n<br>This is a unique opportunity for a motivated and driven individual with an interest (read: obsessive passion) in people to help us build and positively impact our portfolio of start-up through great hiring. Supporting a team of recruitment pro’s, you will be responsible for targeting and engaging the right candidates, and for building a growing talent community for each customer.\n<br>\n<br>As our next *Talent Entrepreneur*, you’ll be trained on the latest sourcing techniques to find top talent, manage candidate communication and develop yourself to be a true ambassador for Create + Adapt and our partners. You’ll be building relationships with plenty of inspiring people and attending lots of events to keep that network growing.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>*About you...*\n<br>\n<br>* You’re an entrepreneur in the making. You’re ready to run, and build something great for yourself. You’ll love all things people; you’ll know what it takes to get things done in a busy environment.\n<br>* You’re a lover of technology.

We work remotely, yes that's right no trudging into the office on a stormy Monday morning (unless you want to)!\n<br>* Our team; we may be compact but what we lack in numbers we makeup for in personality!\n<br>* Your opinion matters. Every member of the team is listened to, and all ideas are welcome! We are all equal here.",

    "content": "FundApps is a startup that helps investment managers stay in compliance with global regulations. Our competition is stuck in the dark ages with slow, clunky, complicated user interfaces and installed software. We're shaking up the industry - providing a beautiful &amp; intuitive web-based service which takes away our clients' pains and lets them get on with what they do best.\n<br>\n<br>We've won multiple accolades from organisations such as Wired, World Economic Forum, Deloitte amongst others.\n<br>\n<br>*About Us*\n<br>We're a small team (currently 60 people) of smart, friendly people with amazing diversity - 26 nationalities at last count. Our HQ is in London, we have growing offices in New York and Singapore, and remote team members in Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Darlington. We collaborate very closely and take pride in delivering an amazing service to our clients, who are some of the world's largest asset managers, hedge funds and pension funds.\n<br>\n<br>We've successfully bootstrapped our way to profitability, so have an incredible amount of freedom when it comes to creating our own destiny.\n<br>\n<br>Despite the heavyweight clients, we pride ourselves on not taking ourselves too seriously, on doing good by our people, our communities and the environment (we became a B-Corp in 2018) and having bucket-loads of fun along the way!\n<br>\n<br>*The Team*\n<br>People Operations (nicknamed POPS internally) was introduced in late 2017 to help smooth the next phase in growth of FundApps as we scale. We’re a two person team currently and take culture super seriously like any growing company worth its salt.\n<br>\n<br>*Rohan* is currently our Talent Partner in London and will soon be focusing on our Learning &amp; Development initiatives including our leadership development, career conversations, early careers, onboarding and general learning content. When Rohan is not at FundApps you’ll find him at a rugby game or training for his next trail marathon.\n<br>\n<br>*Pat* is our Head of People based in New York, and covers a generalist remit including supporting our leadership team, growth planning, reward &amp; payroll and employee relations. Outside of FundApps, you’ll likely find Pat exploring the city, drinking coffee, or planning a return to the tennis court.\n<br>\n<br>Then there’s *YOU!* As our third member of POPS, you’ll be responsible for all recruitment activities across FundApps, including sourcing, branding, recruitment and employer/agency partnerships. We’ve invested heavily in recruitment early in our journey - We have a scalable ATS, an event calendar and university &amp; agency partnerships in place to help source amazing people. Nonetheless, we’re growing quickly and need to continue to raise the bar and deliver a punchy and world-class recruitment and talent process that supports our growth ambitions.\n<br>\n<br>Simply put, your remit will be - *Find the world's most talented people and bring them to FundApps.*\n<br>\n<br>Outside of work, we don’t mind what your interests are, provided you have something you’re passionate about that’s not FundApps! :)\n<br>\n<br>*Responsibilities*\n<br>* Talent Sourcing (50%): Partner with team leaders to understand and anticipate hiring needs, build sourcing strategies and scout talent globally across job platforms.\n<br>* Recruiting (40%): Build a world-class candidate experience and manage the end to end recruitment cycle. Analyse talent metrics to find scalable improvements in how we recruit the top tech and business talent globally.
