You’ve done it on a team and you’ve done it alone. You have no ego and are ready to hop in to help wherever we need it most.</p><strong>You’ve done technical recruiting for at least four years in-house with a software company.&nbsp;</strong><p>&nbsp;You advise your hiring teams on the best approach to full their positions and create/manage a process that delights candidates and empowers hiring decisions.</p><strong>You’re a trusted partner in talent.</strong><p>&nbsp;You will coordinate and develop initiatives to support the same. Prior success with diversity initiatives is highly valued.</p><strong>You are passionate to see more diversity and inclusion in the workplace.</strong><p>You like owning your work streams and the autonomy to progress towards your goals.</p><strong>You’re comfortable driving.&nbsp;</strong><p>&nbsp;You sweat the small stuff but keep the big picture in mind. You know that a job search is a challenging task and by sweating the details you can provide a more human experience for everyone that interacts with Zapier during a hiring process.</p><strong>You provide an incredible candidate experience.</strong><p>&nbsp;If you’ve not used these tools, you should feel comfortable researching them and pushing buttons to see what happens.</p><strong>You have experience with Applicant Tracking Systems (we use Greenhouse) or CRM systems.</strong><p>You track pipeline health to balance your priorities and set hiring manager expectations.</p><strong>You are data driven.&nbsp;</strong><p>&nbsp;You’re willing to research questions, talent, and companies to find the answers and great people to recruit.</p><strong>You are resourceful.</strong><p>&nbsp;No matter if it is diversity outreach or screening of applicants, you are an unstoppably helpful member for our operations team, to both the hiring managers and candidates.</p><strong>You are persistently helpful.</strong><p>&nbsp;You’re comfortable partnering directly with founders and executives to build hiring plans and deliver.</p><strong>Leading leaders is no sweat.</strong><p></p><strong>Things You Might Do</strong><p>Zapier is a fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you’ll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization.

You’ll look for traditional and non-traditional methods to increase the likelihood we can bring new perspectives to the team.</li><li>Find or create new sources of talent. LinkedIn might be a great tool, but you’ll always look for new and unique ways to source talented folks.</li><li>Screen candidates. You’ll serve as the filter of the top of the funnel to maximize the hiring team’s time and focus on interviewing the best candidates.</li><li>Successfully juggle a variety of roles at once. At any given time you could be working on filling 5-10 (or more) open roles.</li><li>Assist with developing job posts and rubrics. You’ll work with the hiring manager to tighten up job descriptions, screening rubrics, and manage the hiring process along the way.</li><li>Iterate on candidate feedback. You’ll constantly smooth rough edges in the hiring process by iterating on feedback from candidates or other signals.</li><li>Nurture relationships with individuals and groups. You’ll help build personal relationships through introductions, references, or by facilitating participation with community groups.</li><li>Develop a diverse pipeline for all current and future roles.</li><li>As a part of Zapier’s&nbsp;, help customers via support to ensure they have the best experience possible.</li><a href='http://workable.com/nr?l=http%3A%2F%2Fworkable.com%2Fnr%3Fl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fzapier.com%252Flearn%252Fcustomer-support%252Feveryone-on-support%252F&amp;utm_source=zapier.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=zapier' rel='nofollow'>all-hands philosophy</a><p></p><strong>About Zapier</strong><p>For the past seven years, Zapier has been helping people across the world automate the boring and tedious parts of their job.
