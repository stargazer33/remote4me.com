With a curiosity to break things, we're a tribe of doers determined to reinvent recruitment. Together, we help transformational brands scale sustainably through building a culture-first approach to recruitment.\n<br>\n<br>Our team has experienced the world of sales-driven recruitment and have always begged the question - there‚Äôs got to be another way? We wanted to make partners out of clients and friends out of our candidates. We couldn‚Äôt find one, so we built it. Now we‚Äôre in a world we love and we‚Äôre here to stay. We‚Äôre not working in recruitment; we‚Äôre working on it. Our model provides scaling businesses, like ourselves, with the unique support they need to develop their rapidly growing team. Our ongoing collabs include Trouva, Hello Fresh, Tech Nation, Feast It, Chip, flatfair and many more... \n<br>\n<br>Think of us as the Spotify for hiring; you can start, pause or stop at any time.\n<br>\n<br> \n<br>*About the role...*\n<br>\n<br>This is a unique opportunity for a motivated and driven individual with an interest (read: obsessive passion) in people to help us build and positively impact our portfolio of start-up through great hiring. Supporting a team of recruitment pro‚Äôs, you will be responsible for targeting and engaging the right candidates, and for building a growing talent community for each customer.\n<br>\n<br>As our next *Talent Entrepreneur*, you‚Äôll be trained on the latest sourcing techniques to find top talent, manage candidate communication and develop yourself to be a true ambassador for Create + Adapt and our partners. You‚Äôll be building relationships with plenty of inspiring people and attending lots of events to keep that network growing.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>*About you...*\n<br>\n<br>* You‚Äôre an entrepreneur in the making. You‚Äôre ready to run, and build something great for yourself. You‚Äôll love all things people; you‚Äôll know what it takes to get things done in a busy environment.\n<br>* You‚Äôre a lover of technology. We‚Äôre talking the latest apps and services that make your life easier.\n<br>* Resilience and a strong worth ethic are non-negotiable.\n<br>* Super smart - we want you to teach us things we don‚Äôt know.\n<br>* Curious, you want to continually learn and develop.\n<br>* A grafter, you‚Äôre a hard worker who wants to progress and develop.\n<br>* A sense of humour is essential, we don‚Äôt compromise on this.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>*What's in it for you...* \n<br>\n<br>* The opportunity to shape your role and grow as fast as we do\n<br>* From day one all team members have a wide remit and are responsible for different aspects of the business\n<br>* 30 days holiday from day one.\n<br>* Plenty of team outings!\n<br>* Our customers, you get to work onsite with them, in our London office or remote. We work remotely, yes that's right no trudging into the office on a stormy Monday morning (unless you want to)!\n<br>* Our team; we may be compact but what we lack in numbers we makeup for in personality!\n<br>* Your opinion matters. Every member of the team is listened to, and all ideas are welcome! We are all equal here.",

    "content": "FundApps is a startup that helps investment managers stay in compliance with global regulations. Our competition is stuck in the dark ages with slow, clunky, complicated user interfaces and installed software. We're shaking up the industry - providing a beautiful &amp; intuitive web-based service which takes away our clients' pains and lets them get on with what they do best.\n<br>\n<br>We've won multiple accolades from organisations such as Wired, World Economic Forum, Deloitte amongst others.\n<br>\n<br>*About Us*\n<br>We're a small team (currently 60 people) of smart, friendly people with amazing diversity - 26 nationalities at last count. Our HQ is in London, we have growing offices in New York and Singapore, and remote team members in Copenhagen, Amsterdam and Darlington. We collaborate very closely and take pride in delivering an amazing service to our clients, who are some of the world's largest asset managers, hedge funds and pension funds.\n<br>\n<br>We've successfully bootstrapped our way to profitability, so have an incredible amount of freedom when it comes to creating our own destiny.\n<br>\n<br>Despite the heavyweight clients, we pride ourselves on not taking ourselves too seriously, on doing good by our people, our communities and the environment (we became a B-Corp in 2018) and having bucket-loads of fun along the way!\n<br>\n<br>*The Team*\n<br>People Operations (nicknamed POPS internally) was introduced in late 2017 to help smooth the next phase in growth of FundApps as we scale. We‚Äôre a two person team currently and take culture super seriously like any growing company worth its salt.\n<br>\n<br>*Rohan* is currently our Talent Partner in London and will soon be focusing on our Learning &amp; Development initiatives including our leadership development, career conversations, early careers, onboarding and general learning content. When Rohan is not at FundApps you‚Äôll find him at a rugby game or training for his next trail marathon.\n<br>\n<br>*Pat* is our Head of People based in New York, and covers a generalist remit including supporting our leadership team, growth planning, reward &amp; payroll and employee relations. Outside of FundApps, you‚Äôll likely find Pat exploring the city, drinking coffee, or planning a return to the tennis court.\n<br>\n<br>Then there‚Äôs *YOU!* As our third member of POPS, you‚Äôll be responsible for all recruitment activities across FundApps, including sourcing, branding, recruitment and employer/agency partnerships. We‚Äôve invested heavily in recruitment early in our journey - We have a scalable ATS, an event calendar and university &amp; agency partnerships in place to help source amazing people. Nonetheless, we‚Äôre growing quickly and need to continue to raise the bar and deliver a punchy and world-class recruitment and talent process that supports our growth ambitions.\n<br>\n<br>Simply put, your remit will be - *Find the world's most talented people and bring them to FundApps.*\n<br>\n<br>Outside of work, we don‚Äôt mind what your interests are, provided you have something you‚Äôre passionate about that‚Äôs not FundApps! :)\n<br>\n<br>*Responsibilities*\n<br>* Talent Sourcing (50%): Partner with team leaders to understand and anticipate hiring needs, build sourcing strategies and scout talent globally across job platforms.\n<br>* Recruiting (40%): Build a world-class candidate experience and manage the end to end recruitment cycle. Analyse talent metrics to find scalable improvements in how we recruit the top tech and business talent globally. Deliver at pace, but never at the expense of a personable and authentic experience.\n<br>* Employer Branding (10%): Be an ambassador to the FundApps employer brand and active player in industry and recruitment events and meetups and across social media.\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>*REQUIREMENTS*\n<br>* Ideally 2+ years demonstrable experience in an in-house generalist HR, recruitment or talent agency role requiring partnership with hiring managers.\n<br>* Flawless written and verbal communication skills and be comfortable talking with people at all levels\n<br>* An expert relationship-builder - with hiring managers, agencies, industry reps and candidates.\n<br>* Ability to analyse data and metrics of success with an eye for detail\n<br>\n<br>Bonus Points\n<br>* Experience in recruiting technical roles, including developers\n<br>* Experience managing agency relationships and using hiring platforms\n<br>* Master of GIFs, emojis and HR/recruitment puns\n<br>\n<br>*VALUES FIT*\n<br>\n<br>* Raise the Bar - Creative mindset and commitment to continuously raising the bar on how we approach recruitment\n<br>* Do More with Less - Without the deep pockets of a VC we have to make smart decisions and everyone at FundApps has an agile &amp; lean mindset.\n<br>* Have Courage - Not afraid to roll sleeves up, build fluency in our service and have the tough conversations when they arise\n<br>* Be Transparent - We default to transparency within our company, when it comes to our recruitment performance and our high/low points along the way. If this makes you feel uncomfortable, we may not be the right company for you.\n<br>* Work with Purpose - We take on average 2 days to evaluate a new job application, and maintain an average of 25 days from application to offer stage. We wouldn‚Äôt have achieved this without laser sharp focus and a comfort prioritising lower value work.\n<br>\n<br>*LIFE AT FUNDAPPS*\n<br>\n<br>* ¬£1,000 learning budget each year and unlimited professional development leave\n<br>* Peer micro-bonuses through Bonusly\n<br>* Flexible working - 90% of our team do it regularly\n<br>* 25 days holiday leave + an extra day next year if you use it all\n<br>* Birthday off\n<br>* Unlimited volunteering leave\n<br>* 26 weeks paid leave for all new parents regardless of gender, location or family structure\n<br>* Unlimited sick and compassionate leave\n<br>* Monthly team outings, including crazy golf, karaoke and escape rooms\n<br>* Peer-led ‚ÄòBrown-bag lunch‚Äô learning sessions\n<br>* Matched pension contribution up to 10%\n<br>* Flexible wellbeing allowance\n<br>\n<br>We are proud of the diversity of all FundAppers - it makes us strong. You will find flexibility around religious observances, our national flags all around the office, a monthly ‚ÄòLaydeez who lunch‚Äô and a Pride celebration with some epic Cher and RuPaul playlists! If you‚Äôre looking for a workplace where you can just be yourself, you‚Äôre in the right place.\n<br>\n<br>*Your privacy*\n<br>Any information you submit through our job application process will be used for the purposes of assessing your fit for a role at FundApps. We may also retrieve and store information from your public social media profiles for the same purpose. You can find out more about how your data is used and your rights in our privacy policy.",
