We are Day Job, two former friends and current business partners who together make up possibly the most atypical tech headhunting shop the world has ever seen.</p>  <p>We’re growing, and we’re looking for someone who wants something more (autonomy, variety, freedom), and something less (meetings, reporting, workplace theatre). On the outside, you’re a full-cycle recruiter with 2-3 years of experience, confident in your sourcing and client management skills. You’ll be the main point of contact for clients and be responsible for sourcing and building your own pipeline of candidates for a few roles at a time, from screening to submission. On the inside, you’re conscientious, pragmatic, motivated, and structured, and feel excited about collaborating with a small group but also working efficiently on your own and taking back some of your life from the traditional 40-hour work week.</p>  <p>You should have experience with and opinions about recruiting processes, quality of feedback, and interviewing best practices. You should feel comfortable sourcing for the typical roles in design, product management, and engineering found in internet tech companies.</p>  <p>If you’re interested please send over a CV and if you want, a quick 1-minute audio message about yourself to <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span> and we’ll get back to you.</p>  <p><strong>About us:</strong></p>  <p>While it was always our dream to start our own boutique search firm, we deferred… honing our chops at places like SoundCloud, Square, Pinterest, and Amazon. Despite the fancy pedigree, we’ve always approached recruitment a bit differently. We talk to people like they’re people, keep things simple, connect quality with quality, and generally just live the dolce vita. As a small company, we’ve built our reputation and business on our networks and word of mouth. We don’t do marketing and aren’t looking to take over the world. We’re selective about our clients, only working with those who we feel are good people and make or offer interesting and healthy products and services.&nbsp; We have core weekly working hours where we’re together in our office in Moabit. The rest is when and where you want. We’re also flexible on comp, from a traditional fixed salary to a commission-based plan, or a combination of the two depending on your risk-reward profile. We have generous vacation allowances and creative remote working opportunities. We’re flattered if you want to move across the world to work for Day Job, however, we can’t support a visa or relocation.</p> </div><span>Apply for this position</span>",

We believe in autonomy and you’ll have full ownership to steer the ship. With that, you’ll also work closely with Hito Leadership to problem solve, strategize and calibrate on progress (pipeline, sourcing, etc). This open way of working isn’t for everyone but we’ve found it’s been a huge part of why we’ve been successful. Drop a line. We want to hear from you!</p><h5><strong>WHAT YOUR DAY MIGHT LOOK LIKE</strong></h5><ul><li>Project manager and point person for several clients</li><li>Build relationships with hiring managers, learn their preferences and earn their trust</li><li>Manage candidate pipeline, address bottlenecks in process and candidate flow</li><li>Iterate, change course and adapt strategies frequently</li><li>Collect and use data to calibrate across candidates</li><li>Phone screen candidates and share profiles with hiring managers</li><li>Schedule, prep and thoughtfully reject candidates</li><li>Track meeting notes and information in our systems</li><li>Build sourcing specs and review profiles</li></ul><h5><strong>WHAT WE’D LIKE TO SEE</strong></h5><ul><li>Full cycle recruiting experience (preference if you’ve worked on technical roles)</li><li>Comfort managing multiple hiring managers across several clients</li><li>Proven bias to action.

No problem, take off that week!)</li><li>Ownership and autonomy over your work</li><li>Competitive pay</li></ul><h5><strong>ABOUT HITO LABS</strong></h5><p>We come from the in-house world of HR and leading teams. We were frustrated by the broken contingency model of recruiting. What happened to truly understanding the team needs and representing the brand to candidates? We do things differently at Hito Labs, truly partnering with hiring managers and becoming a trusted expert on their team. We focus on helping to identify their needs, finding and vetting talent, creating a candidate experience, and getting the right people hired. Our whole team is remote. We value fulfilling work that provides the flexibility to spend time with family, kids and allow us to work from anywhere. We think the future is remote work and we love being part of this movement.</p><h5><strong>HOW TO APPLY</strong></h5><p>Email matt [at] hitolabs.com and jenn [at] hitolabs.com with the subject line “Remote Recruiting – YOUR NAME” with your LinkedIn profile, resume as a PDF and a brief answer to these questions:</p><ol><li>why is a remote role is right for you</li><li>what is your process / how do you work with a client or hiring manager</li><li>how do you decide if a candidate is good enough to present</li><li>how do you manage a pipeline of candidates</li><li>how do you adjust along the way when a role isn’t getting filled</li><li>what type of technical roles you’ve worked on</li><li>salary expectations</li></ol><p>We are committed to diversity and especially encourage members of underrepresented communities to apply.
