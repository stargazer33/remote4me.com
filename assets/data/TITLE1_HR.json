As one of the largest nutrition coaching companies in the world, PN is bigger than it’s ever been and it’s about to get bigger.</p><p>To help us scale, we need an organized recruiter who knows how to spot the right candidates, guide them through the onboarding process, and efficiently coordinate our extended team of external recruiters and contractors so we can help millions more people live healthier, happier lives.</p><p><strong>Join our adventure</strong><br>We’re embarking on a new adventure, and we need a savvy recruiter to expand our team.</p><p><strong>We’ve got an exciting journey ahead of us</strong><br>Over the next 10 years, Precision Nutrition will be expanding its world-class coaching services into a wide range of new fields, including functional medicine, chiropractic and manual therapy, yoga, group exercise, and more.</p><p>To help us reach our goals and keep us moving forward, we need a personable HR veteran who knows how to cut through the noise and find the best possible talent.</p><p><strong>Who we’re looking for</strong><br>An organized, affable HR expert with an eye for exceptional talent.</p><p><strong>You love what you do.</strong><br>You are committed to HR, building and supporting amazing teams that will shape the future of Precision Nutrition. You thrive on collaborating with people to deeply understand the business objectives and hiring needs so that you can bring in top talent. Networking comes naturally to you, and you’re excited to continue learning, growing, and trying new things in a traditionally stagnant field.</p><p><strong>You’r</strong><strong>e a swift prioritizer who doesn’t compromise on quality.</strong><br>We have some ambitious hiring plans – that’s why we need you. You’re a highly organized problem solver who can prioritize, adapt quickly when the scope changes, and thrive in a fast-paced environment with tight deadlines. At the same time, you will make sure we’re not sacrificing quality and that you’re finding the absolute right person for the role.</p><p><strong>You’r</strong><strong>e an exceptional communicator.</strong><br>You’ll be evangelizing our brand to candidates that may not be familiar with PN, so you’ll need a knack for inspiring people and getting them excited. You know when to speak up and when to listen, and you aren’t afraid to ask questions and get clarity when you need it.</p><p><strong>You’r</strong><strong>e flexible and resilient.</strong><br>You aren’t married to your ideas, and know when to seek out other perspectives. You’re energized to roll up your sleeves and dive in. You’ll be part of an HR team of two, so from time to time, you’ll be wearing other HR hats, so you’ll need to be ready to shift gears easily when things change, and embrace honest feedback rather than being stifled by it.</p><p><strong>Yo</strong><strong>u know how to zoom in and zoom out.</strong><br>You can navigate between the big picture and small details. You are able to understand the overall strategy of our hiring plan and can identify all of the small details required to execute, successfully onboard, and support our new team members so they can start making contributions immediately.</p><p><strong>Yo</strong><strong>u may possess psychic abilities.</strong><br>Okay, not really, but you do have an uncanny way of anticipating issues before they even happen and coming up with creative solutions. You know how to find and turn over stones you may not know exist yet.</p><p><strong>You’re self-motivated and can work independently.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>Once you are confident in what you need to do, you can run with it and don’t need a lot of direction.&nbsp;<strong>We’re a fully remote team practicing Holacracy, so your meetings, interviews, and other communications will take place online and you’ll be relatively autonomous. You’ll need to be tech-savvy and comfortable forming and nurturing relationships over Slack and Zoom.</strong></p><p><strong>What you’ll be doing</strong><br>Identifying the right people to join our team</p><p><strong>You’re the matchmaker, analyzing the wants and needs of both sides to find the right match</strong>.<br>Your mission is simple: get our roles into the market so we can attract the right candidates, and get them excited to work with us. You’ll be</p><p>Evaluating our team’s needs. You’ll spend time collaborating with our team to gain a deep understanding of our business, our strategy and our hiring needs so that you can match the right person to the right role.</p><p>Getting the word out. You’ll work with writers and other extended team members to create compelling, accurate job descriptions, then market them in unique, and unconventional, yet highly effective places – even if they’re less traditional. You’ll decide on and coordinate the best methods to source candidates, from a retained search to relevant podcasts to social campaigns.</p><p>Finding the right fit. We attract A LOT of candidates, so you’ll enjoy wading through a big haystack of applicants, and using your discerning eye to find that perfect needle. You’ll also pound the pavement and seek out passive candidates, learn about them inside and out, and excite them about the opportunity to be part of our team.</p><p>Creating an exceptional candidate experience. Applying and interviewing for a job can be stressful for a candidate, but you thrive on raising the bar and making it an exceptional experience. You’ll shepherd candidates through our hiring process from coordinating video interviews to performing reference checks and everything in between. Your interpersonal skills and service orientation ensure that whatever the outcome, each candidate walks away feeling that their interactions with PN exceeded their expectations. They’ll have such a positive experience, they’ll be raving to their friends about it.</p><p><strong>You’re also a guide, helping new hires navigate the waters of their new home.</strong><br>Once you’ve found the right fit, you’ll be getting our new team members ready to hit the ground running.</p><p>Preparing agreements. Since we’re remote, we hire people from all over the globe, so you’ll be putting together employment agreements and contracts based on the candidate, their arrangement and their location.</p><p>Walking new hires through the onboarding process. You’ll help new hires learn about PN, how we work, and integrate them into our awesome team so they dive right in.</p><p>Managing our extended team. We work with a variety of freelancers and contractors, and you’ll maintain those relationships. You’ll check in regularly with our team to ensure everything’s on track, prepare and update agreements, and be sure our extended team is treated like and feels just like an employee or one of our customers would.</p><p>A few important caveats</p><p>This is a dream job, if you’re the right person for it.</p><p><strong>Must-Have #1: You’re experienced.</strong><br>This isn’t your first rodeo.<strong>&nbsp;You have a degree in HR or related field, with at least 4 years of experience in HR and talent acquisition, and a proven track record of hiring the right people for the right role.</strong>&nbsp;You’re well-networked, knowledgeable of hiring practices in Canada and the US (or are willing to learn), and can hit the ground running.</p><p><strong>Must-Have #2: You understand people.</strong><br>You’re a people-person and you know how to guide a conversation to really understand if this person’s a good fit. You pick up on those subtle cues that signal when you need to do more digging, or when someone may not fit in with our culture and team.</p><p><strong>Must-Have #3: You’re ready to think outside the box.</strong><br>We use a variety of mediums to attract candidates, and are always looking for ways to innovate. You aren’t satisfied with the way things are traditionally done, and you’re excited to come up with new ideas.</p><p><strong>Must-Have #4: You’re willing to roll up your sleeves and mature our practice.</strong><br>We’re an HR team of two, so you’ll be rolling up your sleeves and into the details at times, yet always thinking about how we can optimize and improve our systems and processes, so we can do what we do best, while helping our team and PN grow and reach their goals.</p><p><strong>Wondering if this is the right path for you</strong><strong>?</strong><br>Every year, professionals at the top of their field choose to join us. Here are&nbsp;<strong>5 reasons why</strong>.</p><p><strong>W</strong><strong>e give you the freedom to do you.</strong><br>Unlike most companies, we don’t have rigid rules about how and when to do things.<strong>&nbsp;You’ll always be free to work independently, whenever, wherever, and however you want.</strong></p><p><strong>You can work from anywhere.<br>We’re a 100% remote company, and have been working remote for 17 years. When you join our team, you’re no longer shackled to one desk, one office, one city, or even one country!</strong></p><p><strong>Meetings are optional. (No, really.)</strong><br>You’re an adult. You’re capable of deciding how your time should be spent. If you don’t think you need to attend a meeting, you don’t. Simple as that.</p><p><strong>You’ll always feel supported.</strong><br>In a regular office, it’s easy to feel like a hamster in a wheel, powerless to change things. At Precision Nutrition, we work as a team to overcome issues &amp; barriers that stand in each other’s way, and we treat each other with enthusiasm, compassion, and care.</p><p><strong>You’l</strong><strong>l never be bored.</strong><br>People often come to Precision Nutrition after hitting a plateau in their old jobs. At PN, you’ll get the chance to conquer new challenges, learn from the best, and reach thrilling new heights of personal and professional growth.</p><p><strong>Plus: no commute and no 9-to-5 grind.<br>Go ahead: schedule work around your kids. Fly to Europe on a moment’s notice. We don’t care where you’re based or what hours you keep, as long as you always give us your best when it counts.</strong></p><p>Sound like we might just be the perfect company for you? Then you might just be the perfect fit for us.</p><p><strong>Sound like we might just be the perfect company for you?</strong></p><p>Then you might just be the perfect fit for us.</p><p>Precision Nutrition</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.precisionnutrition.com/hr-recruiter/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
