    "content": "<p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>About the company</strong></p><br /><p>LandInsight is a new platform that is fundamentally changing how the property industry buys land for development. It&rsquo;s a big data platform that speeds up the process of finding, assessing and buying land. It comes at an important time, one of the biggest challenges for the UK housing crisis is tackling the shortage of development land. Our tech has changed the game and as a result we&rsquo;ve become the UK&rsquo;s fastest growing PropTech company (and we&rsquo;ve got the awards to prove it!).</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>Our culture</strong></p><br /><p>We live and breath our values of &lsquo;open&rsquo;, &lsquo;empower&rsquo; and &lsquo;home&rsquo;, they are in the footprints of all we do and who we are.</p><br /><p>We truly believe that businesses flourish when people are empowered to work collaboratively and harmoniously. That&rsquo;s why we prioritise team building, high engagement and knowledge sharing in every thread of company. Sitting in our open plan offices means not only knowing the founders, but also learning about the conception and scale of a startup.</p><br /><p>We don&rsquo;t just make empty gestures about our culture - we were voted as the 3rd best UK SaaS Company to work at, and have also received awards for &lsquo;Best at Employee Development&rsquo;.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check out our tech blog <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Ftech-blog.landinsight.io%2F' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>here</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>Your mission </strong></p><br /><p>At the heart of our product is open data, which we pull in from a wide range of sources. Our customers expect the data to be up to date, accurate, and intelligently integrated into our platform.</p><br /><p>The datasets typically contain 1-30 million items. In some cases this is nice and clean at the point we receive it, but in other cases we have to use a combination of machine-learning and hand-crafted algorithms to extract metadata from plain text or pdfs. Also, since most of our data is geospatial, we focus a lot on geocoding data accurately and joining across geospatial datasets.</p><br /><p>In this role, you will first need to assess the infrastructure we currently have, as built by our full-stack engineers. You will then plan how to migrate towards a more robust system, this includes building tools and processes that will empower our remote contractors to keep a check on, and maintain, parts of the system (e.g. scrapers). Importantly, the new system will need to be flexible as we add new datasets and squeeze more meaning from existing datasets.</p><br /><p>A second aspect of the role will be working with geospatial data generated by our users. This part of the business is more in its infancy, but we have grand ambitions for it and would want you to aid in the decision making, even if not working on the implementation yourself.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>Key Responsibilities</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Developing (improving existing and/or creating new) interfaces and/or pipelines to facilitate data collection.</li><br /><li>Identifying, debugging and fixing issues. This includes liaising with other technical/non-technical staff.</li><br /><li>Working closely with remote colleagues (technical and non-technical) who also work on data projects</li><br /><li>Improving our algorithms that derive data from the incoming datasets.</li><br /><li>Educating our full-stack engineers to be better data engineers.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>You are highly competent in one or more programming languages (5+ years experience)</li><br /><li>You are able to reason about the behaviour of systems before starting to build them</li><br /><li>You have built a variety of data processing/management systems</li><br /><li>You have experience with various data visualisation and business intelligence systems</li><br /><li>You are a clear communicator in both written and verbal forms</li><br /><li>AWS is desirable</li><br /><li>NodeJS (or simply JavaScript) is desirable</li><br /><li>MongoDB is desirable</li><br /><li>Postgres is desirable</li><br /><li>Elasticsearch is desirable</li><br /><li>Geographical Information Systems is desirable</li><br /><li>ScrapingHub is desirable</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Flexible working hours</li><br /><li>Professional and personal training budget</li><br /><li>Competitive salary and equity options</li><br /><li>25 days paid holiday (additional to bank holidays)</li><br /><li>Unlimited unpaid holidays</li><br /><li>Dog friendly office</li><br /><li>Loads of social events, including a quarterly away day, an annual ski trip and monthly socials</li><br /><li>Gym and wellness contributions, and a cycle to work scheme</li><br /><li>Dedication to hiring for cultural fit, so you know you&rsquo;re going to be sitting next to someone who you want to grab a beer/glass of prosecco with (usually at the free WeWork bar we have available after 2pm every day!</li><br /></ul>",

We’re passionate about helping companies transform their static digital content into engaging experiences. From custom interactive microcontent, to immersive event microsites, you can build it with Ceros. Publish and update live content instantly, and embed it into your site instantly. Join us in ending the endless creation of static content and be part of the movement towards meaningful content experiences.</p><p>We are well-funded and venture-backed by prominent investors including Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.</p><p><strong>About the Product</strong></p><p>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</p><p>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</p><p>We’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Docker, Jenkins, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</p><p><strong>About the Team</strong></p><p>As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with.

We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it’s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO’s atrocious spelling.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>Working completely from home, you’ll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing.

We will pay you $500 per game.&nbsp;These are simple games, so they shouldn't take you too long to create. Interested? Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 72 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p><p>While we’ve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p><p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p><ul><li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li><li>Working on interesting technical problems that haven’t been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li><li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li><li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li><li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li></ul><p>…you should reach out.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Any computer / tech you want</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We brought Docker to embedded GNU/Linux devices in 2013 and have been building our IoT toolkit ever since. We also maintain a variety of successful open source projects including&nbsp;<a href='https://etcher.io/' rel='nofollow'>Etcher</a>, <a href='https://www.balena.io/open' rel='nofollow'>openBalena</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/engine' rel='nofollow'>balenaEngine</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/os/' rel='nofollow'>balenaOS</a>, and made contributions to high-exposure projects such as&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/' rel='nofollow'>Docker</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://electronjs.org/' rel='nofollow'>Electron</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://appimage.org/' rel='nofollow'>AppImage</a>.</p><p>Our technology is open, standards-based, and proven in production across a wide range of scenarios from drones, 3D printers, point-of-sale devices, tidal turbines, skyscrapers and more. Our investors include DFJ, Aspect Ventures, GE, and Ericsson.</p><p>Balena&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href='https://resin.io/team/' rel='nofollow'>highly distributed, remote-friendly company</a>&nbsp;with a pretty much flat hierarchy. Our organization is adaptive, getting feedback signals from our users and systems. Right now we organize ourselves by projects, which allow us to build complex features and solve big problems, while staying mutable. As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.</p><p>People who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.</p><p>Balena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.</li><li>You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.</li><li>You can execute and complete software projects.</li><li>You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)</li><li>You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.</li><li>An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.</li><li>You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.</li><li>You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.</li></ul><p><strong>Skills we’re looking for</strong></p><ul><li>You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.</li><li>You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.</li><li>You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.</li><li>Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with</li><li>Experience leading a software project</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for the following</strong></p><ul><li>Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement</li><li>Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)</li><li>A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)</li><li>Having worked remotely before</li><li>Interest in embedded systems</li></ul><p>BENEFITS</p><ul><li>Work with extremely talented, diverse team</li><li>Equipment of your choice</li><li>Remote-friendly</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Flexible vacation policy</li><li>Annual company gathering in an international location</li><li>We send you hardware for side projects!</li></ul><p><strong>About working at balena</strong></p><p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://workable.com/j/299979DA26' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Balena</h4>            <div><p>Balena's mission to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT fleet owners.

Jellyfish gathers all information company wide and makes it a platform to implement processes that enhance the team's productivity and understanding. Think of it as a cross between Slack and Excel!\\n\\nThe improved problem space visibility and communication flow that the platform provides to the team is then leveraged to help build and improve both internal and customer facing products. Multiple teams across the company are already relying on the Jellyfish platform for their daily tasks.\\n\\nJellyfish adopts a revolutionary and cutting edge architecture:\\n\\n\\n* The external interface is based on JSON Schema and JSON Patch\\n\\n* Actions on the system are asynchronous by default\\n\\n* The UI is auto-generated based on the data\\n\\n* It can seamlessly integrate with external services such as GitHub and Discourse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Jellyfish team consists of a small group of tight-knit engineers who take pride on moving hyper fast without sacrificing quality by investing on automation, testing, and great engineering practices.\\n\\nWe don't require engineers to be already familiar with the technologies we use.

You'd be bothered by an inefficient process\\n\\n* Desire to make yourself and others more effective. You'd be bothered by an inefficient process\\n\\n* Good understanding of software engineering practices and how to apply them\\n\\n* Excellent written communication skills, and fluency in English\\n\\n* Self-discipline to take on a project and push it to completion without too much management. You also know when to ask for help\\n\\n* Highly organized, able to handle many threads at once, and keep things moving\\n\\n* Strong problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces\\n\\n* Strong understanding of HTTP\\n\\n* Experience working on distributed systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNice to have:\\n\\n\\n* A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)\\n\\n* Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)\\n\\n* Having worked remotely before\\n\\n* Experience with balena as a user\\n\\n* Experience with embedded GNU/Linux, anything ranging from personal projects with a Raspberry Pi to commercial or industrial scenarios with custom devices\\n\\n* Experience with PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, and Node.js\\n\\n* Experience with JSON Schema\\n\\n* Experience with NoSQL or graph databases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMake sure to let us know if any of these items apply to you!\\n\\nABOUT WORKING AT BALENA\\n\\nWe come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\n\\n* Work with an extremely talented, diverse team\\n\\n* Equipment of your choice\\n\\n* Remote-friendly\\n\\n* Flexible working hours\\n\\n* Generous vacation policy\\n\\n* Annual company gathering in an international location - this year, Barcelona in October\\n\\n* We send you hardware for side projects!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTO APPLY\\n\\nWe're delighted to hear about you!

We brought Docker to embedded GNU/Linux devices in 2013 and have been building our IoT toolkit ever since. We also maintain a variety of successful open source projects including&nbsp;<a href='https://etcher.io/' rel='nofollow'>Etcher</a>, <a href='https://www.balena.io/open' rel='nofollow'>openBalena</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/engine' rel='nofollow'>balenaEngine</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/os/' rel='nofollow'>balenaOS</a>, and made contributions to high-exposure projects such as&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/' rel='nofollow'>Docker</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://electronjs.org/' rel='nofollow'>Electron</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://appimage.org/' rel='nofollow'>AppImage</a>.</p><p>Our technology is open, standards-based, and proven in production across a wide range of scenarios from drones, 3D printers, point-of-sale devices, tidal turbines, skyscrapers and more.

Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 24 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built.

We will pay you $500 per game.&nbsp;These are simple games, so they shouldn't take you too long to create. Interested? Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 24 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake.

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone’s day, you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p><p>At NearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

We’re accepting applications for the next few weeks with an ideal start date in early September.\\n\\n\\n**About Scoutbase**\\nScoutbase is a tool that helps shipping companies become safer, more productive and generally better workplaces.\\nIn a nutshell, we do this by helping companies understand what makes daily work and life on a ship difficult for their crews.\\n\\nThe reason why this is valuable to maritime companies is that they suffer from a real lack of up to date, honest and actionable data on what’s difficult for their employees — which could even pose a risk to safety at sea!\\nThe way we help those companies understand those challenges is by collecting real-time data directly from their seafarers.\\n\\nRight now we are focused on the maritime industry and on making life at sea safer for the 1.6 million seafarers out there. But we are exploring opportunities for using our technology to tackle the same lack of data in other industries.\\n\\n\\n**About the Job**\\nBuilding technology solutions for the maritime industry is challenging, but we already have a good MVP running and in the hands of pilot users. Now we are looking for a talented developer to bring Scoutbase to the next level.\\n\\nThis means we are looking for someone to take on this challenge and help us evolve our tech — and our company — over time.\\n\\nYou will pitch in on our product roadmap and come with ideas for new features. You will make sure our product runs smooth and bug-free. You will work on a product that puts a premium on reliability and user experience.\\nThis is a job where you will see the impact of your work. A few months from now the business should look better with you on board. A definite before and after.\\n\\nThis is a big responsibility and we are here to support you, cheer you on, and make it happen.\\nYou can expect to grow in your strengths, versatility, and competence in this job. You can expect an inclusive, eager team who’ll support you in it, rise to challenges with you, and grow together.\\n\\n\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n **If you are Front-end:**\\nYou will be developing a single-page application based on server-side rendered React, Redux, styled-components and Apollo client that consumes GraphQL API.\\n\\nTech &amp; Tools:\\nJavascript (ES7) (a bit of Typescript)\\nReact / Redux\\nGraphQL &amp; Apollo\\nstyled-components\\nWebpack\\n\\n\\n**If you are Back-end:**\\nYou will be developing server code in Node.js, developing our database in PostgreSQL and expanding our GraphQL implementation that supports a single-page application.\\n\\nTech &amp; Tools:\\nDocker\\nJavascript (ES7) (a bit of Typescript)\\nNode.js\\nWebpack\\nGraphQL &amp; Apollo\\nKnex.js &amp; PostgreSQL\\nRedis\\nHeroku\\nCloudFlare\\n\\n\\n**If you are Full-stack:**\\nYou will be developing a single-page application based on server-side rendered React, Redux, styled-components and Apollo client that consumes GraphQL API.\\nYou will be developing server code in Node.js, developing our database in PostgreSQL and expanding our GraphQL implementation that supports a single-page application based on server-side rendered React.\\n\\nTech &amp; Tools:\\nDocker\\nJavascript (ES7) (a bit of Typescript)\\nReact / Redux\\nNode.js\\nWebpackReact / Redux\\nKnex.js &amp; PostgreSQL\\nRedis\\nGraphQL &amp; Apollo\\nHeroku\\nCloudFlare\\n\\n \\n\\n# Requirements\\n**About You**\\nYou are creative. You are organized. You are experienced. You have done this before. You want to do it again. And you absolutely want to do it for us.\\n\\nYou are happy to work for a small startup, where things can change quickly and where priorities, roadmaps and plans might have to be adjusted to reflect new circumstances and opportunities.\\n\\nYou are excited about being in charge of your workstream and taking initiative.\\n\\nYou might have a Computer Science degree. You might not. That’s not the most important thing for us! We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.\\n\\nThis is a remote job — if you want it to be. You’re free to work where you work best, anywhere in the world: home office, coworking space, coffee shops or of course in our HQ in Copenhagen, Denmark!\\n\\nIn order to make sure we all work well together in this setting it is important that you are good at managing your own time and projects reliably, meeting set deadlines and communicating with the rest of the team.\\nWe do require that your normal workday has at least 4 hours overlap with the workday here in Copenhagen (UTC+1) without impinging on your personal/family life.\\n\\nThis means we accept remote applications from UTC-3, UTC-2, UTC-1, UTC +0, UTC+1, UTC+2, UTC+3, UTC+4, UTC+5\\nEnglish is our company language — which means you need to be good at expressing yourself, both in written form and verbally.\\n\\n\\n**Perks**\\nFor us having a life outside of work is important! We are really not about nudging people to do overtime or trapping them in endless meetings. Just the opposite.\\n\\nWe are proud of working with flexible working hours, ample vacation time, and a four-day working week (usually Fridays are off)!\\n\\nQuality time to focus on work starts with quality time to think, exercise, cook, be with family and friends — time to yourself.\\n\\nWe are a small team and work in a very informal, collaborative and relaxed way — and keeping it that way is important to us.\\n\\n\\n**Pay**\\nWe pay between 360.000 DKK (54.000 USD) and 660.000 DKK (100.000 USD) a year, matching to your experience. \\n\\n#Salary\\n54000 USD - 100000 USD\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone’s day, you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</span></p><p><strong><span>What will you be doing?</span></strong></p><p><span>At NearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

We are mostly based in the UK and so the ability to co-ordinate with this timezone is needed.</strong></p><p><strong>About Dotscience</strong></p><p>Dotscience is a startup founded in 2017 and funded by DDN, the world’s largest privately-held storage company. Its mission is to build an end-to-end data science platform that holds AI accountable for its decision making.</p><p>We like to see ourselves as a very friendly and high-trust team. Because we are fully remote we are able to be flexible about parenting responsibilities and other things in life that need your attention. We co-ordinate once a day in a standup where we check in to say how things are going and tell jokes (it is part of our standup routine). The rest of the time we collaborate through GitHub, Slack, Google Hangouts and Google Docs.&nbsp;<strong>We get together in person every 6-8 weeks for a couple of days somewhere in the UK, where we socialise and build our relationships.&nbsp;</strong>We do get some work done too, but it’s mainly about face time. We try to do something fun and we mix up the venues and locations. Sometimes it’s in a WeWork, but sometimes we hire a holiday cottage and have jam sessions! We see our fair share of babies at our meetings, either in person for a visit and a cuddle, or on our video calls.</p><p>The culture in the Engineering team is very collaborative and within the company all discussions are open by default. Everyone is listened to and nobody gets a special pass to push decisions through. You would be a fit for us if you care about how and why things work, engineering quality and user value. We would be a fit for you if you want a supportive, flexible, high-trust work environment where you are encouraged to grow your role at a pace to suit you.</p><p><strong>About the role</strong></p><p>NOTE: We are looking for a number of engineers across the stack, so we’re flexible about exactly which roles we hire into regarding frontend, backend and full stack.</p><p><strong>Tech We Use</strong></p><p><strong>Front-end</strong></p><ul><li>Javascript</li><li>React</li><li>Redux</li><li>CSS</li><li>SCSS</li></ul><p><strong>Back-end</strong></p><ul><li>Go (core)</li><li>Python (knowledge of)</li><li>PostgreSQL</li><li>Javascript</li><li>Node.js</li></ul><p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p><ul><li>Docker / Kubernetes</li><li>AWS / GCE</li><li>Gitlab / Github</li></ul><p>Aims</p><p><strong>Work with the team to:</strong></p><ul><li>Develop a product which is robust and scalable for cloud and on-premise use</li><li>Design and create services and system architecture</li><li>Ensure the product is built to deliver a good user experience</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Design and build our data science platform collaboratively with the team</li><li>Using tech from the list above</li><li>Collaborate through pair programming, attending meetings and being an active member in the self-organising team.</li><li>Help improve our code quality through writing unit tests, automation and performing code reviews</li><li>Participate in brainstorming sessions and contribute ideas to our technology, algorithms and products</li><li>Work with the product and design teams to understand end-user requirements, formulate use cases, and then translate that into a pragmatic and effective technical solution</li><li>Work within the scrum framework to deliver product value to a regular cadence.</li><li>Provide support as part of a rota.</li><li>Write user documentation for the work you do.</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p><strong>Experience</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Degree-level education (or comparable experience) in STEM or another relevant area.</strong></li><li>Good understanding and plenty of practical experience in a statically typed programming language.

We're an innovation project being run like a start-up and we're looking for someone who cares greatly about how and why things work, about engineering quality and about user value. Our aim is to help data science and ML teams to collaborate, to build and to deploy AI models effectively. We believe that building and deploying ML models should be easy, fast and safe. Our mission is to build an end-to-end data science toolset that holds AI accountable for its decision making.

Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.</p><p><strong>Our company</strong>:</p><p>Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.</p><p><br>More information:<a href='https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/' rel='nofollow'> https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/</a></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/287824?reset=False&amp;ra=1ywGIJdBrCCs&amp;oqs=a%3D1ywGIJdBrCCs' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>International environment with distinctive colleagues</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Feedback culture to help everyone grow</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly learning seminars</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly company trip</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Budget for conferences</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Have an impact on the industry that powers global trade</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Help us create a true cloud-native website framework with seamless, intuitive transitions between local and cloud environments — and change the future of the web.</p><p><strong>About Us</strong><br>Gatsby is a remote-first, community-focused team working to build a high-performance, fun to use, astonishingly flexible presentation layer for any data source. Our core values include transparency (we work in public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.</p><p><strong>Details of the Role<br>Type of Work: </strong>Full-time employee<br><strong>Location: Remote (US or International). Preference for UTC-8 to UTC+4.</strong></p><p><strong>Your Opportunity</strong><br>As a core member of our growing team, you will work closely with the rest of our engineering and product teams to turn ideas into tangible products. Your strong systems and API design skills, operations experience, and ability to deliver projects with multiple stakeholders will move the Gatsby platform forward.</p><p><strong>Why we’re hiring</strong><br>Gatsby is growing fast, and we want to build products that make our user’s projects easier to manage, scale, and improve. The Cloud Team is small with a million interesting problems to solve.</p><p><strong>The team’s mission is to extend Gatsby into the cloud — create everything that Gatsby will or could need in the cloud. This includes:</strong></p><ul><li>Creating a supercharged, specialized compiler in the cloud. Features like incremental and parallel builds, GraphQL backends and image processing as a service will help establish</li><li>Enhance individual developer productivity by enhancing their workflow. From generating a new version of a Gatsby site every time a developer saves a file, to visual diffing between versions of Gatsby sites.</li><li>Enable team collaboration on Gatsby projects, especially including non-technical team members. Building on the Gatsby Preview product, and upcoming CI functionality create features like commenting on live previews, CI reports &amp; dashboards visualizing performance, accessibility, and link checking on a per-commit basis.</li></ul><p>Each of these goals — each of these features — need extensive backend work and creative, thoughtful user-focused front-end development. This is far above and beyond what our users are expecting — but exactly what they need.</p><p>The goal is to create a seamless, intuitive transition between local and cloud environments, between individual workflows on their own machine and hosted compute jobs in the cloud.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with product and design, and working alongside and helping mentor team members, in order to realize this vision.</p><p><strong>Some day-to-day responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Create product APIs. As the team builds feature by feature, your role will be to design and build the APIs and services. We use GraphQL and Node.js as our primary platform.</li><li>Provision and manage cloud infrastructure. You will provision and manage our infrastructure, implement internal access control, auditing etc. We run on Google Cloud and Google Kubernetes Engine, with Terraform, Postgres, etc.</li><li>Service infrastructure and operations. You will help define the patterns and ways in which Gatsby adopts microservices and a service-oriented architecture company-wide. You will help build out company-wide initiatives like service meshes, request tracing, and improved observability.</li><li>Mentorship &amp; team development. As an experienced member of the team you’ll coach and guide less experienced members of the team, contribute to the code review process, and help set and maintain a culture of quality throughout the development process.</li></ul><p><strong>Experience you should have:</strong></p><ul><li>Expertise in JavaScript (ES2015+) and/or TypeScript. The Gatsby Cloud team is a JavaScript team with multiple Node.js backend applications and a React frontend, so strong familiarity with the language is important.</li><li>Experience building and shipping production code in a team setting. Deep-seated drive for writing high-quality code.</li><li>Experience building APIs for other software engineers. We primarily use GraphQL, but welcome applications with strong general API design skills.</li><li>Working knowledge of a database system. Could probably diagram Postgres’s architecture with a bit of thought (don’t worry, that’s not an interview question!).</li><li>Battle scars running internet-facing, production systems. Operational knowledge of Linux, HTTP, and the ability to troubleshoot problems anywhere across the stack.</li></ul><p><strong>Experience it would be nice if you had, but isn’t required:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ve used GraphQL before. You may have experimented a bit with GraphQL on a personal toy project. We use GraphQL heavily at Gatsby and Gatsby Cloud, so it’s a plus to have some level of familiarity.</li><li>Familiarity with Kubernetes. You may not deeply understand Kubernetes, but you may have used kubectl before to check out logs or restart a pod.</li></ul><p><strong>The best parts of this job:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll be at the cutting edge of website development — working on one of the fastest-growing site-building frameworks on the market.</li><li>You’re on the cutting edge of platform engineering. You’ll acquire and gain a deep understanding of working with Kubernetes, Istio, and Elastic Cloud.</li><li>An incredible team to learn from and mentor. From domain experts to incredibly talented early-career developers, the Gatsby Cloud Team is a team that you will be challenged by and that you will challenge. It’s a team that will reward your hard work by shipping incredible features more quickly than you thought possible. A team that wants you to thrive here and can’t wait to see what you can do.</li><li>Challenging technical problems. Scaling, container orchestration, running untrusted code at scale. These challenging engineering endeavors and problems are complex, but rewarding and oh so fun.</li></ul><p><strong>The worst parts of this job:</strong></p><ul><li>Shifting context. You may necessarily have to shift context and dive into a different feature before the current one is done. It may even be in an area of the code base you’re unfamiliar with or don’t have a ton of understanding about.</li><li>We move quickly, but don’t sacrifice quality. We ship. Early, often, and quickly. You may not be initially comfortable with the cadence we ship features and improvements to end users.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits we offer:</strong></p><ul><li>3 months of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement</li><li>Unlimited vacation policy, with a minimum of 15 days paid vacation time</li><li>Amazing health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family (US only)</li><li>Skip the commute with remote work</li><li>Fly to cool locations 3x/year for company-wide meetups</li><li>Stock options in a fast-growing startup</li><li>Gatsby Sabbatical: 4 weeks paid vacation after 4 years tenure</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.com/careers/software-engineer-cloud-team/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Unlike other object storage products, it has strong consistency guarantees, it uses a Unix-like file system hierarchy for organizing objects, it supports containerized compute jobs on the storage nodes, and it supports multiple object links. Manta is run both as a public and private cloud service and on premises in many data centers. Architecturally, it is a large-scale distributed system composed of multiple microservices implemented in node.js and C with metadata state stored in PostgreSQL clusters. Additionally, we are exploring emerging languages and platforms for new development; e.g., Rust.</p><p>Candidates</p><p>We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code—software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We're seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack. At any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed, perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect you to have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience. We are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.</p>",

Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...</p><p>But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t &quot;sudo cancel my Comcast subscription&quot; but you can &quot;magic cancel my Comcast subscription.&quot; It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions.

It’s your companion and your friend.</p><p>Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.</p><p>ABOUT THE POSITION:</p><p>Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible.

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.\\n\\nPeople who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.\\n\\nBalena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.\\n\\n* You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.\\n\\n* You can execute and complete software projects.\\n\\n* You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)\\n\\n* You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.\\n\\n* An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.\\n\\n* You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.\\n\\n* You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkills we’re looking for\\n\\n\\n* You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.\\n\\n* You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.\\n\\n* You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.\\n\\n* Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with\\n\\n* Experience leading a software project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBonus points for the following\\n\\n\\n* Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement\\n\\n* Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)\\n\\n* A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)\\n\\n* Having worked remotely before\\n\\n* Interest in embedded systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\n\\n* Work with extremely talented, diverse team\\n\\n* Equipment of your choice\\n\\n* Remote-friendly\\n\\n* Flexible working hours\\n\\n* Flexible vacation policy\\n\\n* Annual company gathering in an international location\\n\\n* We send you hardware for side projects!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout working at balena\\n\\nWe come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.\\n\\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.  </div> </div>",

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.</p><p>People who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.</p><p>Balena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.</li><li>You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.</li><li>You can execute and complete software projects.</li><li>You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)</li><li>You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.</li><li>An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.</li><li>You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.</li><li>You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.</li></ul><p><strong>Skills we’re looking for</strong></p><ul><li>You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.</li><li>You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.</li><li>You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.</li><li>Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with</li><li>Experience leading a software project</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for the following</strong></p><ul><li>Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement</li><li>Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)</li><li>A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)</li><li>Having worked remotely before</li><li>Interest in embedded systems</li></ul><p>BENEFITS</p><ul><li>Work with extremely talented, diverse team</li><li>Equipment of your choice</li><li>Remote-friendly</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Flexible vacation policy</li><li>Annual company gathering in an international location</li><li>We send you hardware for side projects!</li></ul><p><strong>About working at balena</strong></p><p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://workable.com/j/299979DA26' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Balena</h4>            <div><p>Balena's mission to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT fleet owners.

We are responsible for low level technologies like cluster filesystems as well as web-based frontends for monitoring and managing clusters, so we need people who are willing to learn and move around between projects and languages. We work entirely with free and open source software in upstream projects, so experience contributing to such development would be valuable, and the software we develop is used in mission critical applications so a focus on testing, test automation and software quality is also important.</p>\n <p><br>Currently, we are working on making migration to the public cloud smoother for users of our technology. This includes work on configuration management, automation, testing and monitoring, and also to work in partnership with SAP, Amazon, Microsoft and many others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n <p><br><strong>Here is a brief list of technologies and tools we work with:</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Python, Go, Ruby, Salt, Terraform, &nbsp;Prometheus, Grafana, C, C++, Autotools, Git, Pacemaker, Corosync, Bash, Perl, Ansible, Travis CI, Jenkins, Docker, Swagger, Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, Node.js,md-raid, OCFS2, Netweaver and SAP HANA.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It's a long list! If you know all of them that is amazing. None of us do! But together as a team, we cover all of these things and more.
