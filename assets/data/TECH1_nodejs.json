Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. We believe that diversity drives our vibe. We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on.

We work hard but maintain a casual work environment with a strong culture as a tech startup.

The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are transparent, reliable and considerate. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.</p><p>Beyond this, our requirements are:</p><ul><li>You have experience leading a team of developers (remote is ideal!)</li><li>You have both front-end <em>and</em> back-end experience</li><li>You have experience with React - unless you have significant Javascript experience with other libraries so that you’ll be able to pick it up quickly</li><li>You have experience creating and iterating on products from end-to-end: we think there are certain things that freelance and agency work doesn’t teach you such as working end-to-end (full feature) on an entire system.</li><li>You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a> with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d <a href='https://cl.ly/3s0O4314002E' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>. Also, meet <a href='https://cl.ly/082v1Q2D0B2a' rel='nofollow'>Brice</a>, another engineer at Aula and former CTO! See an example of <a href='https://cl.ly/130A1h0V230k' rel='nofollow'>one of our remote offices here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. We’ve explained it in more detail in <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>this blog post</a>, but here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Microservices backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to develop skills in building both consumer tech interfaces as well core infrastructure back-ends</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a seasoned full-stack developer that can build features across the entire stack (front-end, back-end, mobile) and challenge our thinking on architecture. Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Pushing our thinking on core architecture choices</li><li>Be part of leading a high-performing team: inspiring team members, set priorities and own results</li><li>Building backend microservices</li><li>Working directly with Adrian, CPO and designer, to build, maintain and improve slick user interfaces across devices.</li><li>Switching between different apps and devices (web, desktop, iOS, Android).</li><li>Improving and maintaining our distributed architecture.</li></ul><p><strong>Interview process <br></strong>Interview processes&nbsp;don’t need to be scary and stressful for us to be able to pick out those of you that would fit in the best at Aula.</p><p>The first three stages all take place asynchronously in a dedicated Slack channel filled with other curious and smart candidates - it’s turned out to be <a href='https://cl.ly/1P1P2i0k1320' rel='nofollow'>quite a community</a>. You’ll chat with Oliver about your experience and your thoughts on particular topics, build&nbsp;a simple app,&nbsp;and meet the team on video conference. If both parties feel comfortable, we’ll then give you an offer to join us. The whole process takes place over the course of around 10 days, in your own time.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role. Please start your application with the words ‘I breathe semicolons’ to show that you took your time to read all of this </p><p>Look forward to hearing from you,</p><p>The Aula team </p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://aulaeducation.recruitee.com/o/fullstack-javascript-developer-reactnodejs' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Aula</h3>            <div><p>Aula is a communication platform for education.

We brought Docker to embedded GNU/Linux devices in 2013 and have been building our IoT toolkit ever since. We also maintain a variety of successful open source projects including&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fetcher.io%2F' rel='nofollow'>Etcher</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.balena.io%2F' rel='nofollow'>Balena</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fresinos.io%2F' rel='nofollow'>resinOS</a>, and made contributions to high-exposure projects such as&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.docker.com%2F' rel='nofollow'>Docker</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Felectronjs.org%2F' rel='nofollow'>Electron</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fappimage.org%2F' rel='nofollow'>AppImage</a>.</p><p>Our technology is open, standards-based, and proven in production across a wide range of scenarios from drones, 3D printers, point-of-sale devices, tidal turbines, skyscrapers and more.

Our organization is adaptive, getting feedback signals from our users and systems. Right now we organize ourselves by projects, which allow us to build complex features and solve big problems, while staying mutable. As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p><strong><strong>About</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>Role</strong></strong></p><p>This is a hands-on role.

We primarily do so through&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/Medi-Share/Medi-Share.aspx' rel='nofollow'>Medi-Share</a>, but as an association of churches, we’re rapidly expanding our “ministry portfolio” and we think technology will be at the center of accomplishing that goal. That’s where you come in. We need help creating and supporting applications (mobile + browser) for the future products and projects we’ve got in the proverbial “hopper.”</p><p>But before we go any further, you need to know if you’ll like working with us. We think you will.</p><p><strong>A bit about us:&nbsp;</strong>You already know the mission of Christian Care Ministry (CCM). We have about 580 employees in various states, but most of them are either at our headquarters in Melbourne, FL, or our Colorado Springs, CO branch. Medi-Share has been growing in every way imaginable since about 2010. It has become commonplace for our CFO to say things like “We’ve grown 30% year over year …again” at seemingly every quarterly employee town hall meeting. We’re extremely humbled and grateful to the Lord for the growth.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is a community of Christians that requires its employees to share its Christian religious beliefs and practices. CCM complies with all anti-discrimination laws applicable to religious employers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the role:</strong>&nbsp;This position serves on the New Product Engineering Team in a Product Team setting. This small, sub-department of our IT team (which is currently under 10 people) is mostly remote. Their main focus has been making some dreams of the leadership team come true (well, at least the dreams that involve amazing code :).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Life as an Employee with CCM’s New Product Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong>We work really hard to make working here an amazing experience. It’s hard to find great talent like you, but if you pick us, we want to keep you for a long time. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Do you prefer mountains or oceans?</strong></p><p>While the majority of the NPE Team is distributed, it is our overwhelming preference that you live near our Colorado Springs, CO office or our headquarters in Melbourne, FL.&nbsp; However, with modern tools, proximity doesn’t influence productivity and if absolutely necessary, we can discuss an exception. For this job in particular, we do need some collaboration though, so just make sure you have a reliable internet connection, of course.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>The New Product Engineering Team is operating in “start up” mode. This means that we work hard and smart to get projects completed in a reasonable timeline. On occasion, there may be instances when extra time is needed (usually around a product launch or a really big release), but those are pretty infrequent. Basically, we commit you to at least 6 hours of coding per day in our Sprints and as long as you get the work done, we’re okay with when you get it done. Just be available when the team may need your help, or when you may need their help. Sometimes life happens in the middle of the day, and we understand that. We also think “more meetings” means less time for coding so we protect your time. We have one morning stand-up at 10am EST where we find out when there could be overlap that day. Oh, one more cool thing about the only meeting you attend – we “eat our own dog food” and close each stand-up praying for Medi-Share members’ needs listed in our mobile app.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it by giving you those extra 2 hours per workday to collaborate or learn. The stack we generally work on is relatively new so taking time to hone in your skills is pretty imperative. We send members to conferences or webinars as we need to. We love seeing our people growing.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer…</strong></p><p>This is the part where we describe the experience necessary to be considered for the position.</p><p>You’re a skilled developer, but maybe you haven’t gotten a chance to prove it yet professionally. We can give you that chance.&nbsp;</p><p>But before you get _too_ excited, let me explain. We only hire great developers, and this position is no exception. When we ask you to write or debug code during our interviews, you’ll do so confidently. You might not be able to show us 5 applications you’ve shipped, but you can point to something recent you’ve spent significant time coding that you’re really proud of, like your university project, your open source contributions, or your project at your last job. If we ask your professors, classmates, or coworkers about you, they’ll have great things to say.</p><p>In short, we won’t teach you how to be a good programmer, since you already are, but we can certainly help you be a better, professionally-experienced programmer.</p><p>Our ideal candidate either has a college degree in computer science, or if not, 2+ years of recent, solid professional programming experience. Our especially ideal candidate has experience with either Node.js or React.js. Having only done that in your free time is fine. That tells us you are curious enough to learn on your own.</p><p>Our stack contains a very healthy JavaScript client utilizing Heroku, Node.js, React.js, and a few others. CCM is in the process of migrating to Salesforce so we often interact with their APIs. For our mobile apps we’re using React Native, because, well, basically, it’s awesome (and we really think our philosophies of “API First” and “Learn Once, Code Everywhere” are going to be the norm in the near future). Our backend API servers use either Ruby on Rails or Node.js/Express, with PostgreSQL and Redis as our data layer. Despite those being our “sweet spots” before we take on a new product, we pick the stack that works best for that solution.</p><p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are curious how things work, you are self-motivated and self-driven.</li><li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li><li>Thrive with directions like:<ul><li>“Here is the mock up for feature X. How do you think we should approach this?”</li><li>&quot;Check out the Jira story and play a bit with library X on GitHub. This might solve our problem Y. Let's discuss the pros and cons tomorrow.&quot; &nbsp;</li><li>&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it and why do you think that's a good idea?&quot;</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li><li>You got a smirk on your face when you saw you could work on the stack listed above, AT A MINISTRY!</li><li>As you’ve read this job description, you realize this team obviously is comprised of people who you’d enjoy spending a work week with. (ended that sentence with a preposition, we're not paid for our grammatical skills)</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p><ul><li>You already are a Medi-Share member or would want to join membership even if you didn’t work here.</li><li>You’ve built stuff using React Native (even if it was for your mom’s bingo club or something crazier).</li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>Super important stuff that sounds like it was written by lawyers:</p><p>This job description in no way states or implies that these are the only duties to be performed by the employee(s) incumbent in this position. Employee(s) will be required to follow any other job-related instructions and to perform any other job-related duties requested by any person authorized to give instructions or assignments. This document does not create an employment contract, implied or otherwise, other than an &quot;at will&quot; relationship.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is committed to&nbsp;serving&nbsp;the Lord and our membership with excellence. As&nbsp;employees&nbsp;we are&nbsp;committed to adhering&nbsp;to the same standard of Biblical principles of lifestyle and health as required for membership in our Medi-Share program which include:</p><ul><li>Have a verifiable Christian testimony indicating a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, and profess the&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/what_we_believe.aspx' rel='nofollow'><strong>Statement of Faith</strong></a></li><li>Attend a fellowship of believers, regularly and actively support that ministry, and live under the discipline of that body</li><li>Share the conviction that believers are to bear one another’s burdens according to Galatians 6:2</li><li>Believe the Biblical doctrine that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;are to be kept pure</li><li>Must not engage in sex outside of traditional Christian marriage</li><li>Cannot use tobacco or illegal drugs in any form, or abuse legal drugs or alcohol</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;How To Apply</strong></p><ul><li>Apply here. In your cover letter, introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.</li><li>Please include links to apps you’ve built or anything else that makes you look good, and describe your role in building those apps. (If they’re internal, you can skip the link part.)</li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for. Plus, you’ll see at our site we ask for a lot of the same info anyway.</li><li>Please complete the following questions, and include them with your cover letter. This shouldn’t take you very long.<ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? Is there another language that you’re curious to learn next?</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>In a 2-3 sentences, what has your life with Jesus looked like over the last 3 weeks? There’s no wrong answer.</li></ul></li></ul><p>There will be a few other things if we get past the first interview, but we’ll cover that later. We even like doing our hiring on an iterative basis.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/christiancareministry/jobs/1215334' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Onsite gym</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>15 days PTO</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>$621/month flex earnings for health coverage</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.<br>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. Thats a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.<br><br> <br>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, FT, Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Australian Herald to name a few.

We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.<br><br><br>Apply if you want to:<br> * Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.<br> * Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.<br> * Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.<br> * Develop robust deployment and testing processes <br> * Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.<br> <br><br><br>Benefits<br><br>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> <br> * Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.<br> * 25 days holiday<br> * Pension Scheme<br> * Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.<br> * We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office. We run a Remote working structure as a team (we currently have team members in London, Bristol and Stoke in the UK and Barcelona, Spain) so time zone variance (and travel distance) has to be sensible. <br> <br><br><br><br>We can't offer visa sponsorship at this time. <p>See more jobs at <span>Roostermoney</span></p></div></div>",

Interested in helping build the tool for partners and developers that powers automation for millions of professionals? Then read on…<br><br>We know applying for and taking on a new job at any company requires a leap of faith. We want you to feel comfortable and excited to apply at Zapier. To help share a bit more about life at Zapier, here are a few resources in addition to the job description that can give you an inside look at what life is like at Zapier. We hope you'll take the leap of faith and apply.<br><br><br>* Our Commitment to Applicants<br><br>* Culture and Values at Zapier<br><br>* Zapier Guide to Remote Work<br><br>* Zapier Code of Conduct<br><br>* Diversity and Inclusivity at Zapier<br><br><br><br><br>Zapier is proud to be an equal opportunity workplace dedicated to pursuing and hiring a diverse workforce.<br><br>Even though our job description may seem like we're looking for a specific candidate, the role inevitably ends up tailored to the person who applies and joins. Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if:<br><br>You're motivated by building effective engineering teams and are happy to roll up your sleeves and dive into code when needed.<br><br>About You<br><br>You are a skilled engineer.&nbsp;You've got a strong background working in our stack (React, ES6, Node.js, etc.) -- even if you aren't a daily coder, you regularly exercise your coding muscles and try to be an asset on any technical context your team may need.<br><br>You are an effective team builder. This isn't your first rodeo. You know how to hire, train, and develop engineers from all backgrounds. You understand the benefits of building a diverse and inclusive engineering team. You may not have hired or managed hundreds of people before, but you have hired, trained, and managed at least a few engineers before.<br><br>You're adaptable. You've been in fast growing companies and know how to build, change, and adapt to the needs of a company as it grows.<br><br>You have excellent communication skills. You regularly work with engineers and other stakeholders from various disciplines, balancing engineering concerns, such as technical debt, with product concerns. Ideally, you find solutions that address both the team and user needs but if not, help build understanding around difficult decisions.<br><br>You can keep track of, prioritize, and lead multiple projects.

You'll carve out time for functional projects and make sure they solve real problems the team faces -- ideally making development even easier.<br><br><br>Things You Might Do<br><br>Zapier is a small, fast-growing, and remote-first company, so you'll likely get experience on many different projects across the organization. That said, here are some things you'll probably do:<br><br><br>* Help the team build tools for partners and developers that come to our platform to create Apps that live on Zapier. Imagine Postman meets OpenAPI on steroids!<br><br>* Develop effective ways to communicate, monitor, and lead your team through weekly one-on-one’s and team meetings.<br><br>* Keep the leadership team informed on your team’s progress in ways that are easy and enjoyable to receive, like one-on-one's, update posts, and regular team hangouts.<br><br>* Build rapport with each member of the Front End Engineering Team and support them through coaching and mentorship to help level up their skills.<br><br>* Participate in code reviews, learning and spreading technical knowledge throughout Zapier -- moving knowledge to documentation where appropriate.<br><br>* Occasionally dive into the code; fixing bugs, improving developer experience, smoothing edges -- sometimes even spiking out small proofs of concept.<br><br>* Collaborate across various disciplines (Product Managers, Designers, Researchers) to help set technical roadmaps that will achieve business goals through engineering best practices.<br><br>* Actively recruit, onboard, and train new engineers at Zapier. This might involve tweaking the skills portions of interviews, or writing better documentation.<br><br>* As part of our&nbsp;All Hands Support&nbsp;initiative, help customers have the best experience with Zapier as possible.<br><br><br><p>See more jobs at <span>Zapier</span></p></div></div>",

We primarily do so through&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/Medi-Share/Medi-Share.aspx' rel='nofollow'>Medi-Share</a>, but as an association of churches, we’re rapidly expanding our “ministry portfolio” and we think technology will be at the center of accomplishing that goal. That’s where you come in. We need help creating and supporting applications (mobile + browser) for the future products and projects we’ve got in the proverbial “hopper.”</p><p>But before we go any further, you need to know if you’ll like working with us. We think you will.</p><p><strong>A bit about us:&nbsp;</strong>You already know the mission of Christian Care Ministry (CCM). We have about 580 employees in various states, but most of them are either at our headquarters in Melbourne, FL, or our Colorado Springs, CO branch. Medi-Share has been growing in every way imaginable since about 2010. It has become commonplace for our CFO to say things like “We’ve grown 30% year over year …again” at seemingly every quarterly employee town hall meeting. We’re extremely humbled and grateful to the Lord for the growth.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is a community of Christians that requires its employees to share its Christian religious beliefs and practices. CCM complies with all anti-discrimination laws applicable to religious employers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the role:</strong>&nbsp;This position serves on the New Product Engineering Team in a Product Team setting. This small, sub-department of our IT team (which is currently under 10 people) is mostly remote. Their main focus has been making some dreams of the leadership team come true (well, at least the dreams that involve amazing code :).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Life as an Employee with CCM’s New Product Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong>We work really hard to make working here an amazing experience. It’s hard to find great talent like you, but if you pick us, we want to keep you for a long time. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Do you prefer mountains or oceans?</strong></p><p>While the majority of the NPE Team is distributed, it is our overwhelming preference that you live near our Colorado Springs, CO office or our headquarters in Melbourne, FL.&nbsp; However, with modern tools, proximity doesn’t influence productivity and if absolutely necessary, we can discuss an exception. For this job in particular, we do need some collaboration though, so just make sure you have a reliable internet connection, of course.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>The New Product Engineering Team is operating in “start up” mode. This means that we work hard and smart to get projects completed in a reasonable timeline. On occasion, there may be instances when extra time is needed (usually around a product launch or a really big release), but those are pretty infrequent. Basically, we commit you to at least 6 hours of coding per day in our Sprints and as long as you get the work done, we’re okay with when you get it done. Just be available when the team may need your help, or when you may need their help. Sometimes life happens in the middle of the day, and we understand that. We also think “more meetings” means less time for coding so we protect your time. We have one morning stand-up at 10am EST where we find out when there could be overlap that day. Oh, one more cool thing about the only meeting you attend – we “eat our own dog food” and close each stand-up praying for Medi-Share members’ needs listed in our mobile app.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it by giving you those extra 2 hours per workday to collaborate or learn. The stack we generally work on is relatively new so taking time to hone in your skills is pretty imperative. We send members to conferences or webinars as we need to. We love seeing our people growing.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer…</strong></p><p>This is the part where we describe the experience necessary to be considered for the position.</p><p>You’re a skilled developer, but maybe you haven’t gotten a chance to prove it yet professionally. We can give you that chance.&nbsp;</p><p>But before you get _too_ excited, let me explain. We only hire great developers, and this position is no exception. When we ask you to write or debug code during our interviews, you’ll do so confidently. You might not be able to show us 5 applications you’ve shipped, but you can point to something recent you’ve spent significant time coding that you’re really proud of, like your university project, your open source contributions, or your project at your last job. If we ask your professors, classmates, or coworkers about you, they’ll have great things to say.</p><p>In short, we won’t teach you how to be a good programmer, since you already are, but we can certainly help you be a better, professionally-experienced programmer.</p><p>Our ideal candidate either has a college degree in computer science, or if not, 2+ years of recent, solid professional programming experience. Our especially ideal candidate has experience with either Node.js or React.js. Having only done that in your free time is fine. That tells us you are curious enough to learn on your own.</p><p>Our stack contains a very healthy JavaScript client utilizing Heroku, Node.js, React.js, and a few others. CCM is in the process of migrating to Salesforce so we often interact with their APIs. For our mobile apps we’re using React Native, because, well, basically, it’s awesome (and we really think our philosophies of “API First” and “Learn Once, Code Everywhere” are going to be the norm in the near future). Our backend API servers use either Ruby on Rails or Node.js/Express, with PostgreSQL and Redis as our data layer. Despite those being our “sweet spots” before we take on a new product, we pick the stack that works best for that solution.</p><p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are curious how things work, you are self-motivated and self-driven.</li><li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li><li>Thrive with directions like:<ul><li>“Here is the mock up for feature X. How do you think we should approach this?”</li><li>&quot;Check out the Jira story and play a bit with library X on GitHub. This might solve our problem Y. Let's discuss the pros and cons tomorrow.&quot; &nbsp;</li><li>&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it and why do you think that's a good idea?&quot;</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li><li>You got a smirk on your face when you saw you could work on the stack listed above, AT A MINISTRY!</li><li>As you’ve read this job description, you realize this team obviously is comprised of people who you’d enjoy spending a work week with. (ended that sentence with a preposition, we're not paid for our grammatical skills)</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p><ul><li>You already are a Medi-Share member or would want to join membership even if you didn’t work here.</li><li>You’ve built stuff using React Native (even if it was for your mom’s bingo club or something crazier).</li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>Super important stuff that sounds like it was written by lawyers:</p><p>This job description in no way states or implies that these are the only duties to be performed by the employee(s) incumbent in this position. Employee(s) will be required to follow any other job-related instructions and to perform any other job-related duties requested by any person authorized to give instructions or assignments. This document does not create an employment contract, implied or otherwise, other than an &quot;at will&quot; relationship.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is committed to&nbsp;serving&nbsp;the Lord and our membership with excellence. As&nbsp;employees&nbsp;we are&nbsp;committed to adhering&nbsp;to the same standard of Biblical principles of lifestyle and health as required for membership in our Medi-Share program which include:</p><ul><li>Have a verifiable Christian testimony indicating a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, and profess the&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/what_we_believe.aspx' rel='nofollow'><strong>Statement of Faith</strong></a></li><li>Attend a fellowship of believers, regularly and actively support that ministry, and live under the discipline of that body</li><li>Share the conviction that believers are to bear one another’s burdens according to Galatians 6:2</li><li>Believe the Biblical doctrine that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;are to be kept pure</li><li>Must not engage in sex outside of traditional Christian marriage</li><li>Cannot use tobacco or illegal drugs in any form, or abuse legal drugs or alcohol</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;How To Apply</strong></p><ul><li>Apply here. In your cover letter, introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.</li><li>Please include links to apps you’ve built or anything else that makes you look good, and describe your role in building those apps. (If they’re internal, you can skip the link part.)</li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for. Plus, you’ll see at our site we ask for a lot of the same info anyway.</li><li>Please complete the following questions, and include them with your cover letter. This shouldn’t take you very long.<ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? Is there another language that you’re curious to learn next?</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>In a 2-3 sentences, what has your life with Jesus looked like over the last 3 weeks? There’s no wrong answer.</li></ul></li></ul><p>There will be a few other things if we get past the first interview, but we’ll cover that later. We even like doing our hiring on an iterative basis.</p>            </div><div>How to apply:<br><a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/christiancareministry/jobs/1215334' rel='nofollow'>boards.greenhouse.io/christiancareministry/jobs/1215334</a></div>",

The scope of our work includes the low-level libraries which interface with the blockchain using REST APIs and JSON, and an initial set of dapps to provide early users with the tools they need, and to provide other developers with high-quality example code which they can build on and learn from.

As stated, the goal of the applications is both to give early users of the blockchain a great user experience, and excellent security, and to be a platform to build on, and reference library for other developers and companies coming to our blockchain.</p><p>We use modern, functional paradigms in our code, which makes the task for the SDK team more difficult, but makes writing code which uses it much more easy. So we’re looking for someone at the top of their game, who has kept up to date with the most recent developments in the state of the art of JavaScript development, and who’s looking to keep their skills up-to-date.</p><p><strong>About You</strong></p><p>Our ideal candidate is an experienced programmer and systems architect who is collaborative, self-motivated, who is interested in new challenges and a fast and dedicated learner. We tend to prefer functional programming idioms, which you should be comfortable with. You can push ideas forward in an agile project environment, are comfortable working with a diverse, partly remote team, and are able to see the big picture in any project as well as lead your team to clarity with a solutions-oriented approach. You are a bridge between the technical and visual aspects of the project, and always excited about new possibilities.

    "content": "*About Fluidly*<br />Fluidly is a seed stage fintech startup that launched to the public in October 2017. We’re building a new category - intelligent business finance.<br /><br />We want to solve the biggest problem facing small businesses - poor cashflow. We use technology to provide real-time cashflow forecasting and automated credit control that helps small businesses and their accountants to be more confident about future cash position and to help them make better financial decisions. Fluidly plugs into accounting software packages such as Xero, QuickBooks and Sage and combines financial data with machine learning techniques to produce a cashflow forecast that requires absolutely no modelling.<br /><br />We’ve recently been selected for the FinTech50 2018 “Hot 10” list and we are really excited that we’re one of 12 finalists for the Nesta Open Up challenge, designed for companies who are transforming small business banking.<br /><br />Within the accounting industry we’ve been nominated for the AccountingWeb Forecasting, Planning & Analysis Software of the Year and Innovation of the Year. We’ve also recently been featured in the Sunday Times, the Telegraph and Wired and have been described as “one of the true disruptors of the fintech industry”.<br /><br />Fluidly is backed by some of the UK’s leading technology investors and we have a diverse, top-tier team across the board, drawn from leading firms and universities. Our Founder/CEO is a serial entrepreneur, recently awarded an OBE for services to Business: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolineplumb/<br /><br />*About the role*<br />You will be reporting to the CTO and will be a senior member of the engineering team. Initially, your job is to help us focus on scaling out the product as we bring on more users. You must be comfortable working across the stack, implementing UI features and scaling our infrastructure and databases as the amount of data we handle increases. You will also be involved in monitoring and management of our services. It’s a small team and we all need to help each other out - this helps us all communicate better.<br /><br />You’ll have significant experience building production software and thoroughly understand the quirks of web development, ideally with React.js and Node.js. You will also have been deep into the data tier and will be comfortable tuning SQL and Mongo queries, identifying bottlenecks in distributed systems and fixing them, and automating platform-related maintenance tasks. On the front end, you should be able to build out a feature so that it just works (don’t worry, we have a designer who will make sure that it is pretty and user-friendly!).<br /><br />Technology wise, the solution is a full stack javascript (React + Node) monolithic application. We aim to add other tech such as golang, clojure and microservices to the stack as we scale, but for now productivity is our main priority so we are keeping things simple.<br /><br />*Interview process*<br /><br />*Skype call* <br />A short conversation of 15-30 minutes to find out a little bit more about you and tell you all about the company and what we are trying to achieve.<br /><br />*Take home technical exercise* <br />Everyone hates technical exercises so we want this to be as painless as possible. We have a standard exercise that will take 1-2 hours depending on experience - you can do this at home on your own equipment without a stranger standing over you.<br /><br />*On site interview* <br />You will bring in your technical exercise and we’ll talk through your solution and your experience more generally. After that we will do a pair programming exercise that’ll take about an hour.<br /><br />*Meet the Team* <br />Depending on our / your schedules this might be a on different day to the technical interview. Come and meet the rest of the team and ask us anything.<br /><br />*Compensation*<br /><br />* The most competitive salary we can afford. We are an early stage startup and have to make our seed funding last. This means we can’t afford to compete directly on salary. As we grow, we will close this gap quickly. Dependent on experience (DOE).<br />* Meaningful equity. We want people to have a serious stake in the business so that all of our interests are aligned. It’s your baby too. DOE.<br />* 25 days holiday - and we will make you take it. Sure, there will be some long days, but burnout is not big or clever.<br />* Limitless challenge and scope for development.<br />* As much of our time as you need. You professional growth is important to us, and we want to help you to be awesome. It’s not just technical, Caroline will be helping build your commercial and business skills too, if that’s something you are interested in.<br />* Sensible problem that will add real value to real people. This isn’t an HBO parody company.<br />* Flexible working where possible. We like being in the office because it should be fun. All the same if you need to leave early on ${DAY} to make the school run, that’s no problem.<br />* All the crisps (and fruit) you can eat.<br /><br /><br />You can learn a little more about us here:<br /><br />https://www.accountingweb.co.uk/tech/tech-pulse/fluidlys-top-10-partnership-shows-professions-ai-appetite<br /><br />https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/why-entrepreneur-turned-down-richard-branson-mckinsey-start-own-business/entrepreneurs/article/1463042<br /><br />https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/why-entrepreneur-turned-down-richard-branson-mckinsey-start-own-business/entrepreneurs/article/1463042",
