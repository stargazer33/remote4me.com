We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 24 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p><p>While we’ve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p><p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p><ul><li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li><li>Working on interesting technical problems that haven’t been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li><li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li><li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li><li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li></ul><p>…you should reach out.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Any computer / tech you want</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 24 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p><p>While we’ve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p><p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p><ul><li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li><li>Working on interesting technical problems that haven’t been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li><li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li><li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li><li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li></ul><p>…you should reach out.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Any computer / tech you want</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone’s day, you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</p><p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p><p>At NearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

We’re accepting applications for the next few weeks with an ideal start date in early September.\\n\\n\\n**About Scoutbase**\\nScoutbase is a tool that helps shipping companies become safer, more productive and generally better workplaces.\\nIn a nutshell, we do this by helping companies understand what makes daily work and life on a ship difficult for their crews.\\n\\nThe reason why this is valuable to maritime companies is that they suffer from a real lack of up to date, honest and actionable data on what’s difficult for their employees — which could even pose a risk to safety at sea!\\nThe way we help those companies understand those challenges is by collecting real-time data directly from their seafarers.\\n\\nRight now we are focused on the maritime industry and on making life at sea safer for the 1.6 million seafarers out there. But we are exploring opportunities for using our technology to tackle the same lack of data in other industries.\\n\\n\\n**About the Job**\\nBuilding technology solutions for the maritime industry is challenging, but we already have a good MVP running and in the hands of pilot users. Now we are looking for a talented developer to bring Scoutbase to the next level.\\n\\nThis means we are looking for someone to take on this challenge and help us evolve our tech — and our company — over time.\\n\\nYou will pitch in on our product roadmap and come with ideas for new features. You will make sure our product runs smooth and bug-free. You will work on a product that puts a premium on reliability and user experience.\\nThis is a job where you will see the impact of your work. A few months from now the business should look better with you on board. A definite before and after.\\n\\nThis is a big responsibility and we are here to support you, cheer you on, and make it happen.\\nYou can expect to grow in your strengths, versatility, and competence in this job. You can expect an inclusive, eager team who’ll support you in it, rise to challenges with you, and grow together.\\n\\n\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n **If you are Front-end:**\\nYou will be developing a single-page application based on server-side rendered React, Redux, styled-components and Apollo client that consumes GraphQL API.\\n\\nTech &amp; Tools:\\nJavascript (ES7) (a bit of Typescript)\\nReact / Redux\\nGraphQL &amp; Apollo\\nstyled-components\\nWebpack\\n\\n\\n**If you are Back-end:**\\nYou will be developing server code in Node.js, developing our database in PostgreSQL and expanding our GraphQL implementation that supports a single-page application.\\n\\nTech &amp; Tools:\\nDocker\\nJavascript (ES7) (a bit of Typescript)\\nNode.js\\nWebpack\\nGraphQL &amp; Apollo\\nKnex.js &amp; PostgreSQL\\nRedis\\nHeroku\\nCloudFlare\\n\\n\\n**If you are Full-stack:**\\nYou will be developing a single-page application based on server-side rendered React, Redux, styled-components and Apollo client that consumes GraphQL API.\\nYou will be developing server code in Node.js, developing our database in PostgreSQL and expanding our GraphQL implementation that supports a single-page application based on server-side rendered React.\\n\\nTech &amp; Tools:\\nDocker\\nJavascript (ES7) (a bit of Typescript)\\nReact / Redux\\nNode.js\\nWebpackReact / Redux\\nKnex.js &amp; PostgreSQL\\nRedis\\nGraphQL &amp; Apollo\\nHeroku\\nCloudFlare\\n\\n \\n\\n# Requirements\\n**About You**\\nYou are creative. You are organized. You are experienced. You have done this before. You want to do it again. And you absolutely want to do it for us.\\n\\nYou are happy to work for a small startup, where things can change quickly and where priorities, roadmaps and plans might have to be adjusted to reflect new circumstances and opportunities.\\n\\nYou are excited about being in charge of your workstream and taking initiative.\\n\\nYou might have a Computer Science degree. You might not. That’s not the most important thing for us! We care about what you can do and how you do it, not about how you got here. A strong track record of conscientious, thoughtful work speaks volumes.\\n\\nThis is a remote job — if you want it to be. You’re free to work where you work best, anywhere in the world: home office, coworking space, coffee shops or of course in our HQ in Copenhagen, Denmark!\\n\\nIn order to make sure we all work well together in this setting it is important that you are good at managing your own time and projects reliably, meeting set deadlines and communicating with the rest of the team.\\nWe do require that your normal workday has at least 4 hours overlap with the workday here in Copenhagen (UTC+1) without impinging on your personal/family life.\\n\\nThis means we accept remote applications from UTC-3, UTC-2, UTC-1, UTC +0, UTC+1, UTC+2, UTC+3, UTC+4, UTC+5\\nEnglish is our company language — which means you need to be good at expressing yourself, both in written form and verbally.\\n\\n\\n**Perks**\\nFor us having a life outside of work is important! We are really not about nudging people to do overtime or trapping them in endless meetings. Just the opposite.\\n\\nWe are proud of working with flexible working hours, ample vacation time, and a four-day working week (usually Fridays are off)!\\n\\nQuality time to focus on work starts with quality time to think, exercise, cook, be with family and friends — time to yourself.\\n\\nWe are a small team and work in a very informal, collaborative and relaxed way — and keeping it that way is important to us.\\n\\n\\n**Pay**\\nWe pay between 360.000 DKK (54.000 USD) and 660.000 DKK (100.000 USD) a year, matching to your experience. \\n\\n#Salary\\n54000 USD - 100000 USD\\n \\n\\n#Location\\n- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

Turn on your monitor and join the daily standup. Call done, hit play on your favourite playlist, tap the volume key a few times and get in the zone. First on your list for today is to review some GitHub pull requests that need your attention. The rest of the morning goes by working on a feature for the weekly client demo. Lunchtime arrives and you head to your yoga class. Feeling stretched and relaxed, you make yourself something to eat, grab (another) cup of coffee and get back to work. Some remote problem solving with the team and then it’s back to code. Hunger calls and you know it’s time to shut the laptop. After catching up on everyone’s day, you go pack for your trip to NodeConf the next day.</span></p><p><strong><span>What will you be doing?</span></strong></p><p><span>At NearForm, we work with international clients who are industry leaders in their respective fields.

We are mostly based in the UK and so the ability to co-ordinate with this timezone is needed.</strong></p><p><strong>About Dotscience</strong></p><p>Dotscience is a startup founded in 2017 and funded by DDN, the world’s largest privately-held storage company. Its mission is to build an end-to-end data science platform that holds AI accountable for its decision making.</p><p>We like to see ourselves as a very friendly and high-trust team. Because we are fully remote we are able to be flexible about parenting responsibilities and other things in life that need your attention. We co-ordinate once a day in a standup where we check in to say how things are going and tell jokes (it is part of our standup routine). The rest of the time we collaborate through GitHub, Slack, Google Hangouts and Google Docs.&nbsp;<strong>We get together in person every 6-8 weeks for a couple of days somewhere in the UK, where we socialise and build our relationships.&nbsp;</strong>We do get some work done too, but it’s mainly about face time. We try to do something fun and we mix up the venues and locations. Sometimes it’s in a WeWork, but sometimes we hire a holiday cottage and have jam sessions! We see our fair share of babies at our meetings, either in person for a visit and a cuddle, or on our video calls.</p><p>The culture in the Engineering team is very collaborative and within the company all discussions are open by default. Everyone is listened to and nobody gets a special pass to push decisions through. You would be a fit for us if you care about how and why things work, engineering quality and user value. We would be a fit for you if you want a supportive, flexible, high-trust work environment where you are encouraged to grow your role at a pace to suit you.</p><p><strong>About the role</strong></p><p>NOTE: We are looking for a number of engineers across the stack, so we’re flexible about exactly which roles we hire into regarding frontend, backend and full stack.</p><p><strong>Tech We Use</strong></p><p><strong>Front-end</strong></p><ul><li>Javascript</li><li>React</li><li>Redux</li><li>CSS</li><li>SCSS</li></ul><p><strong>Back-end</strong></p><ul><li>Go (core)</li><li>Python (knowledge of)</li><li>PostgreSQL</li><li>Javascript</li><li>Node.js</li></ul><p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p><ul><li>Docker / Kubernetes</li><li>AWS / GCE</li><li>Gitlab / Github</li></ul><p>Aims</p><p><strong>Work with the team to:</strong></p><ul><li>Develop a product which is robust and scalable for cloud and on-premise use</li><li>Design and create services and system architecture</li><li>Ensure the product is built to deliver a good user experience</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Design and build our data science platform collaboratively with the team</li><li>Using tech from the list above</li><li>Collaborate through pair programming, attending meetings and being an active member in the self-organising team.</li><li>Help improve our code quality through writing unit tests, automation and performing code reviews</li><li>Participate in brainstorming sessions and contribute ideas to our technology, algorithms and products</li><li>Work with the product and design teams to understand end-user requirements, formulate use cases, and then translate that into a pragmatic and effective technical solution</li><li>Work within the scrum framework to deliver product value to a regular cadence.</li><li>Provide support as part of a rota.</li><li>Write user documentation for the work you do.</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p><strong>Experience</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Degree-level education (or comparable experience) in STEM or another relevant area.</strong></li><li>Good understanding and plenty of practical experience in a statically typed programming language.

We're an innovation project being run like a start-up and we're looking for someone who cares greatly about how and why things work, about engineering quality and about user value. Our aim is to help data science and ML teams to collaborate, to build and to deploy AI models effectively. We believe that building and deploying ML models should be easy, fast and safe. Our mission is to build an end-to-end data science toolset that holds AI accountable for its decision making.

Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.</p><p><strong>Our company</strong>:</p><p>Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.</p><p><br>More information:<a href='https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/' rel='nofollow'> https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/</a></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/287824?reset=False&amp;ra=1ywGIJdBrCCs&amp;oqs=a%3D1ywGIJdBrCCs' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>International environment with distinctive colleagues</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Feedback culture to help everyone grow</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly learning seminars</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly company trip</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Budget for conferences</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Have an impact on the industry that powers global trade</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Help us create a true cloud-native website framework with seamless, intuitive transitions between local and cloud environments — and change the future of the web.</p><p><strong>About Us</strong><br>Gatsby is a remote-first, community-focused team working to build a high-performance, fun to use, astonishingly flexible presentation layer for any data source. Our core values include transparency (we work in public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.</p><p><strong>Details of the Role<br>Type of Work: </strong>Full-time employee<br><strong>Location: Remote (US or International). Preference for UTC-8 to UTC+4.</strong></p><p><strong>Your Opportunity</strong><br>As a core member of our growing team, you will work closely with the rest of our engineering and product teams to turn ideas into tangible products. Your strong systems and API design skills, operations experience, and ability to deliver projects with multiple stakeholders will move the Gatsby platform forward.</p><p><strong>Why we’re hiring</strong><br>Gatsby is growing fast, and we want to build products that make our user’s projects easier to manage, scale, and improve. The Cloud Team is small with a million interesting problems to solve.</p><p><strong>The team’s mission is to extend Gatsby into the cloud — create everything that Gatsby will or could need in the cloud. This includes:</strong></p><ul><li>Creating a supercharged, specialized compiler in the cloud. Features like incremental and parallel builds, GraphQL backends and image processing as a service will help establish</li><li>Enhance individual developer productivity by enhancing their workflow. From generating a new version of a Gatsby site every time a developer saves a file, to visual diffing between versions of Gatsby sites.</li><li>Enable team collaboration on Gatsby projects, especially including non-technical team members. Building on the Gatsby Preview product, and upcoming CI functionality create features like commenting on live previews, CI reports &amp; dashboards visualizing performance, accessibility, and link checking on a per-commit basis.</li></ul><p>Each of these goals — each of these features — need extensive backend work and creative, thoughtful user-focused front-end development. This is far above and beyond what our users are expecting — but exactly what they need.</p><p>The goal is to create a seamless, intuitive transition between local and cloud environments, between individual workflows on their own machine and hosted compute jobs in the cloud.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with product and design, and working alongside and helping mentor team members, in order to realize this vision.</p><p><strong>Some day-to-day responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Create product APIs. As the team builds feature by feature, your role will be to design and build the APIs and services. We use GraphQL and Node.js as our primary platform.</li><li>Provision and manage cloud infrastructure. You will provision and manage our infrastructure, implement internal access control, auditing etc. We run on Google Cloud and Google Kubernetes Engine, with Terraform, Postgres, etc.</li><li>Service infrastructure and operations. You will help define the patterns and ways in which Gatsby adopts microservices and a service-oriented architecture company-wide. You will help build out company-wide initiatives like service meshes, request tracing, and improved observability.</li><li>Mentorship &amp; team development. As an experienced member of the team you’ll coach and guide less experienced members of the team, contribute to the code review process, and help set and maintain a culture of quality throughout the development process.</li></ul><p><strong>Experience you should have:</strong></p><ul><li>Expertise in JavaScript (ES2015+) and/or TypeScript. The Gatsby Cloud team is a JavaScript team with multiple Node.js backend applications and a React frontend, so strong familiarity with the language is important.</li><li>Experience building and shipping production code in a team setting. Deep-seated drive for writing high-quality code.</li><li>Experience building APIs for other software engineers. We primarily use GraphQL, but welcome applications with strong general API design skills.</li><li>Working knowledge of a database system. Could probably diagram Postgres’s architecture with a bit of thought (don’t worry, that’s not an interview question!).</li><li>Battle scars running internet-facing, production systems. Operational knowledge of Linux, HTTP, and the ability to troubleshoot problems anywhere across the stack.</li></ul><p><strong>Experience it would be nice if you had, but isn’t required:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ve used GraphQL before. You may have experimented a bit with GraphQL on a personal toy project. We use GraphQL heavily at Gatsby and Gatsby Cloud, so it’s a plus to have some level of familiarity.</li><li>Familiarity with Kubernetes. You may not deeply understand Kubernetes, but you may have used kubectl before to check out logs or restart a pod.</li></ul><p><strong>The best parts of this job:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll be at the cutting edge of website development — working on one of the fastest-growing site-building frameworks on the market.</li><li>You’re on the cutting edge of platform engineering. You’ll acquire and gain a deep understanding of working with Kubernetes, Istio, and Elastic Cloud.</li><li>An incredible team to learn from and mentor. From domain experts to incredibly talented early-career developers, the Gatsby Cloud Team is a team that you will be challenged by and that you will challenge. It’s a team that will reward your hard work by shipping incredible features more quickly than you thought possible. A team that wants you to thrive here and can’t wait to see what you can do.</li><li>Challenging technical problems. Scaling, container orchestration, running untrusted code at scale. These challenging engineering endeavors and problems are complex, but rewarding and oh so fun.</li></ul><p><strong>The worst parts of this job:</strong></p><ul><li>Shifting context. You may necessarily have to shift context and dive into a different feature before the current one is done. It may even be in an area of the code base you’re unfamiliar with or don’t have a ton of understanding about.</li><li>We move quickly, but don’t sacrifice quality. We ship. Early, often, and quickly. You may not be initially comfortable with the cadence we ship features and improvements to end users.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits we offer:</strong></p><ul><li>3 months of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement</li><li>Unlimited vacation policy, with a minimum of 15 days paid vacation time</li><li>Amazing health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family (US only)</li><li>Skip the commute with remote work</li><li>Fly to cool locations 3x/year for company-wide meetups</li><li>Stock options in a fast-growing startup</li><li>Gatsby Sabbatical: 4 weeks paid vacation after 4 years tenure</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.com/careers/software-engineer-cloud-team/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Unlike other object storage products, it has strong consistency guarantees, it uses a Unix-like file system hierarchy for organizing objects, it supports containerized compute jobs on the storage nodes, and it supports multiple object links. Manta is run both as a public and private cloud service and on premises in many data centers. Architecturally, it is a large-scale distributed system composed of multiple microservices implemented in node.js and C with metadata state stored in PostgreSQL clusters. Additionally, we are exploring emerging languages and platforms for new development; e.g., Rust.</p><p>Candidates</p><p>We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code—software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We're seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack. At any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed, perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect you to have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience. We are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.</p>",

Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...</p><p>But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t &quot;sudo cancel my Comcast subscription&quot; but you can &quot;magic cancel my Comcast subscription.&quot; It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions.

It’s your companion and your friend.</p><p>Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.</p><p>ABOUT THE POSITION:</p><p>Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible.

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.\\n\\nPeople who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.\\n\\nBalena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.\\n\\n* You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.\\n\\n* You can execute and complete software projects.\\n\\n* You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)\\n\\n* You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.\\n\\n* An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.\\n\\n* You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.\\n\\n* You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkills we’re looking for\\n\\n\\n* You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.\\n\\n* You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.\\n\\n* You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.\\n\\n* Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with\\n\\n* Experience leading a software project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBonus points for the following\\n\\n\\n* Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement\\n\\n* Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)\\n\\n* A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)\\n\\n* Having worked remotely before\\n\\n* Interest in embedded systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\n\\n* Work with extremely talented, diverse team\\n\\n* Equipment of your choice\\n\\n* Remote-friendly\\n\\n* Flexible working hours\\n\\n* Flexible vacation policy\\n\\n* Annual company gathering in an international location\\n\\n* We send you hardware for side projects!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout working at balena\\n\\nWe come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.\\n\\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.  </div> </div>",

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.</p><p>People who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.</p><p>Balena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.</li><li>You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.</li><li>You can execute and complete software projects.</li><li>You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)</li><li>You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.</li><li>An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.</li><li>You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.</li><li>You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.</li></ul><p><strong>Skills we’re looking for</strong></p><ul><li>You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.</li><li>You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.</li><li>You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.</li><li>Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with</li><li>Experience leading a software project</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for the following</strong></p><ul><li>Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement</li><li>Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)</li><li>A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)</li><li>Having worked remotely before</li><li>Interest in embedded systems</li></ul><p>BENEFITS</p><ul><li>Work with extremely talented, diverse team</li><li>Equipment of your choice</li><li>Remote-friendly</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Flexible vacation policy</li><li>Annual company gathering in an international location</li><li>We send you hardware for side projects!</li></ul><p><strong>About working at balena</strong></p><p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://workable.com/j/299979DA26' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Balena</h4>            <div><p>Balena's mission to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT fleet owners.

We are responsible for low level technologies like cluster filesystems as well as web-based frontends for monitoring and managing clusters, so we need people who are willing to learn and move around between projects and languages. We work entirely with free and open source software in upstream projects, so experience contributing to such development would be valuable, and the software we develop is used in mission critical applications so a focus on testing, test automation and software quality is also important.</p>\n <p><br>Currently, we are working on making migration to the public cloud smoother for users of our technology. This includes work on configuration management, automation, testing and monitoring, and also to work in partnership with SAP, Amazon, Microsoft and many others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n <p><br><strong>Here is a brief list of technologies and tools we work with:</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Python, Go, Ruby, Salt, Terraform, &nbsp;Prometheus, Grafana, C, C++, Autotools, Git, Pacemaker, Corosync, Bash, Perl, Ansible, Travis CI, Jenkins, Docker, Swagger, Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, Node.js,md-raid, OCFS2, Netweaver and SAP HANA.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It's a long list! If you know all of them that is amazing. None of us do! But together as a team, we cover all of these things and more.

I'm the Founder &amp; CTO of Command E…a lightning-fast, secure way to instantly find anything in the cloud with a simple keyboard shortcut. We're building a desktop app (Electron/React/Redux/SQLite) that syncs cloud data locally to your laptop and provides a Spotlight-like search &amp; command interface on top of your cloud data.</p>\n<p>Command E is basically a CLI for business users, built on top of their cloud data. It's inspired by the &quot;fuzzy finder&quot; search boxes in IDEs (i.e. Command-T plugin in vi, Helm plugin in Emacs, ⌘T in Atom, ⌘P in VSCode, etc.). The app has a lot of polish and a very clean, simple design. We already support many enterprise and consumer cloud services (Salesforce, Google Docs, LinkedIn, Asana, Trello, 15+ more).</p>\n<p>We're a small team of 3 Silicon Valley veterans, well-capitalized by top Silicon Valley VC firms + angel investors. Both co-founders are engineers who worked at a VC firm, Eventbrite, and Digg. Our office is at 2nd and Market in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>We're looking to hire 2 senior/core engineers. You'll be building a top-notch Silicon Valley company with experienced founders going after a massive market: search. Electron experience (or desire) is a big plus, but we're open to other backgrounds too. My co-founder and I met ~5 years ago through a &quot;Who's Hiring&quot; thread so we're excited to see who responds to this one - please email me at ben@getcommande.com if you’re interested.</p>",

Our systems are critical to software engineers all over the world and used in every industry; from the public registry, which serves packages to open source engineers and small organizations, to our new enterprise solution, which provides single tenant registries for medium and large customers.</p>\n <p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>\n <p>You are a capable engineer with a passion for working on products and a strong desire to grow. As a member on one of our cross-functional delivery teams you will work in a creative environment tackling complex problems. Our work has far-reaching impact and you will play an important role in the feature delivery by solving technical challenges driving the implementation.</p>\n <p><strong>Here’s the impact you’ll make and what we’ll accomplish together:</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Support a modern software practice</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Follow processes, align work with guidance and goals, and work with other team members to deliver</li>\n  <li>Improve the frequency and quality of iterations over time through process, tooling, and providing feedback</li>\n  <li>Ensure work follows our evolving standards, guidelines and recommendations</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Support the product strategy</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Build features and experiences that reduce effort for our customers and generate tangible value</li>\n  <li>Assist in improvements to our technology stack in ways that will positively impact our customers and community</li>\n  <li>Maintain and evolve the codebase and systems in support of the portfolio’s roadmap</li>\n </ul>\n <p>If these are elements you are excited about and are interested in joining one of npm’s cross-functional teams dedicated to the mission of improving our products, this is the ideal role for you.</p>\n <p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience with JavaScript and/or Node.js</li>\n  <li>Knowledge of HTTP and experience with HTTP APIs</li>\n  <li>Knowledge of RDBMSs and SQL</li>\n  <li>Familiarity with one or more modern component based web UI libraries</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Great to Have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience shipping software in one or more cloud providers</li>\n  <li>Success building services in a microservice or SOA architecture</li>\n  <li>Experience with Docker and/or Kubernetes</li>\n  <li>Knowledge of one or more major CDN services</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Our Code of Conduct</strong></p>\n <p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior.</p>\n <p><strong>Why You Should Join</strong></p>\n <p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p>\n <p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p>\n <p><strong>Where We Can Hire</strong></p>\n <p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. <strong>We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico. </strong>We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/a1d7e38b-b259-4789-b880-5690fd002bb9' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

Our systems are critical to software engineers all over the world and used in every industry; from the public registry, which serves packages to open source engineers and small organizations, to our new enterprise solution, which provides single tenant registries for medium and large customers.</p>\n<p>What You’ll Do</p>\n<p>You are an experienced engineer with a passion for working on products and mentoring other engineers in technical areas. As a member on one of our cross-functional delivery teams you will work in a creative environment tackling complex problems. Our work has far-reaching impact and you will play a critical role by driving the feature delivery, solving technical challenges, and mentoring other engineers on your team.</p>\n<p>Here’s the impact you’ll make and what we’ll accomplish together:</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Support a modern software practice</strong>\n<p>* Follow processes, ensure tasks are aligned with goals, and work with team members to deliver</p>\n<p>* Improve the frequency and quality of iterations over time through process, tooling, and providing feedback</p>\n<p>* Ensure work follows our evolving standards, guidelines and recommendations</p>\n<p>* Provide mentoring and guidance for other team members in areas of expertise</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Support the product strategy</strong>\n<p>* Build features and experiences that reduce effort for our customers and generate tangible value</p>\n<p>* Identify opportunities to improve our technology stack in ways that will positively impact our customers and community</p>\n<p>* Maintain and evolve the codebase and systems in support of the portfolio’s roadmap</p>\n<p>If these are elements you are excited about and are interested in joining one of npm’s cross-functional teams dedicated to the mission of improving our products, this is the ideal role for you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Qualifications</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Demonstrated ability and desire to mentor, teach, and lead others</li>\n<li>Experience delivering production services and/or public web sites with JavaScript and&nbsp;</li>\n<a href='http://node.js/' rel='nofollow'>js</a>\n<li>Familiarity with HTTP and experience building well-designed HTTP APIs</li>\n<li>Familiarity with one or more modern component based web UI libraries</li>\n<li>Success building services in a microservice or SOA architecture</li>\n<li>Knowledge of RDBMSs and SQL</li>\n<li>Experience shipping software in one or more cloud providers</li>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Great to Have</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Familiarity with distributed systems concepts</li>\n<li>Experience with Docker and/or Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Knowledge of one or more major CDN services</li>\n<p>Our Code of Conduct</p>\n<p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct&nbsp;.</p>\n<a href='https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct' rel='nofollow'>here</a>\n<p>Why You Should Join</p>\n<p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p>\n<p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p>\n<p>Where We Can Hire</p>\n<p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/643a9752-268f-4ae8-975f-9b33213b6313' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>\n</div>",
