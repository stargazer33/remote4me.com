While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.\\n\\nPeople who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of whatâs important.\\n\\nBalena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- weâd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.\\n\\n* You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.\\n\\n* You can execute and complete software projects.\\n\\n* You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)\\n\\n* You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.\\n\\n* An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.\\n\\n* You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.\\n\\n* You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and youâll raise a flag if itâs not making sense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkills weâre looking for\\n\\n\\n* You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your teamâs work.\\n\\n* You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, youâd be bothered by an inefficient process.\\n\\n* You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of othersâ work and decisions well.\\n\\n* Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with\\n\\n* Experience leading a software project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBonus points for the following\\n\\n\\n* Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement\\n\\n* Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)\\n\\n* A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)\\n\\n* Having worked remotely before\\n\\n* Interest in embedded systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\n\\n* Work with extremely talented, diverse team\\n\\n* Equipment of your choice\\n\\n* Remote-friendly\\n\\n* Flexible working hours\\n\\n* Flexible vacation policy\\n\\n* Annual company gathering in an international location\\n\\n* We send you hardware for side projects!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout working at balena\\n\\nWe come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.\\n\\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.  </div> </div>",

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.</p><p>People who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of whatâs important.</p><p>Balena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- weâd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.</li><li>You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.</li><li>You can execute and complete software projects.</li><li>You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)</li><li>You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.</li><li>An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.</li><li>You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.</li><li>You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and youâll raise a flag if itâs not making sense.</li></ul><p><strong>Skills weâre looking for</strong></p><ul><li>You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your teamâs work.</li><li>You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, youâd be bothered by an inefficient process.</li><li>You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of othersâ work and decisions well.</li><li>Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with</li><li>Experience leading a software project</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for the following</strong></p><ul><li>Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement</li><li>Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)</li><li>A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)</li><li>Having worked remotely before</li><li>Interest in embedded systems</li></ul><p>BENEFITS</p><ul><li>Work with extremely talented, diverse team</li><li>Equipment of your choice</li><li>Remote-friendly</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Flexible vacation policy</li><li>Annual company gathering in an international location</li><li>We send you hardware for side projects!</li></ul><p><strong>About working at balena</strong></p><p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://workable.com/j/299979DA26' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Balena</h4>            <div><p>Balena's mission to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT fleet owners.

We are responsible for low level technologies like cluster filesystems as well as web-based frontends for monitoring and managing clusters, so we need people who are willing to learn and move around between projects and languages. We work entirely with free and open source software in upstream projects, so experience contributing to such development would be valuable, and the software we develop is used in mission critical applications so a focus on testing, test automation and software quality is also important.</p>\n <p><br>Currently, we are working on making migration to the public cloud smoother for users of our technology. This includes work on configuration management, automation, testing and monitoring, and also to work in partnership with SAP, Amazon, Microsoft and many others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n <p><br><strong>Here is a brief list of technologies and tools we work with:</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Python, Go, Ruby, Salt, Terraform, &nbsp;Prometheus, Grafana, C, C++, Autotools, Git, Pacemaker, Corosync, Bash, Perl, Ansible, Travis CI, Jenkins, Docker, Swagger, Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, Node.js,md-raid, OCFS2, Netweaver and SAP HANA.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It's a long list! If you know all of them that is amazing. None of us do! But together as a team, we cover all of these things and more. So if you know one or two of these and are interested in learning more, or if you really want to dive deep into one particular piece of technology, our team might be right for you.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n <p><br><strong>What we expect from you:</strong><br><br></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>We expect that you know how to code and love to do it as part of a team developing great solutions for our customers, that means, code reviews, unit testing and other techniques to maintain the high quality of our deliverables will be part of your daily routine.</li>\n  <li>We also expect you to be self-motivated and eager to learn and experiment new things by your own, but also in collaboration with your and other teams, and in the end to get the things done.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>We present our work to gather feedback and learn from the many nice people we have here at SUSE, and we expect you to do the same.</li>\n  <li>We also expect that you have experience with complex solutions that demands architecture discussions and release coordination, inside and outside of our team.</li>\n  <li>As in an international team, you will need to communicate in English and we also expect that you have some experience using Linux operating systems.</li>\n  <li>Last, and most important: We expect you to have fun while providing great solutions for our customers.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><br><strong>What would be nice to have:</strong><br><br></p>\n <p>We work a lot with automation, so experience of CI/CD tools, IaC (like Terraform) and configuration management (Salt, Ansible...) would help us a lot. Also, if you have experience with Agile and Devops methodologies or understand this culture and values, this can make this position right for you.&nbsp;<br>Would be great if you have experience with Cloud Providers like Azure, AWS and GCP and know the challenges to deploy Enterprise solutions there, like SAP, Oracle, or any other mission critical applications. &nbsp;If you know how to do it using a cluster, this is awesome. We work with clusters, so familiarity with high-availability is a big plus.</p>\n <br>Don't worry if you don't have any of these experiences, you can still show us your potential and motivation to learn about them!\n <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n <br>\n <strong>We Offer:</strong>\n <ul>\n  <li>Direct contact with representatives of free and open source software projects worldwide.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Regular &quot;Hackweeks&quot; and workshops on the company, department, and team levels.</li>\n  <li>Opportunities to take part in IT and open-source conferences all over the world, both as an attendee or a presenter.</li>\n  <li>Five weeks vacation.

I'm the Founder &amp; CTO of Command Eâ¦a lightning-fast, secure way to instantly find anything in the cloud with a simple keyboard shortcut. We're building a desktop app (Electron/React/Redux/SQLite) that syncs cloud data locally to your laptop and provides a Spotlight-like search &amp; command interface on top of your cloud data.</p>\n<p>Command E is basically a CLI for business users, built on top of their cloud data. It's inspired by the &quot;fuzzy finder&quot; search boxes in IDEs (i.e. Command-T plugin in vi, Helm plugin in Emacs, âT in Atom, âP in VSCode, etc.). The app has a lot of polish and a very clean, simple design. We already support many enterprise and consumer cloud services (Salesforce, Google Docs, LinkedIn, Asana, Trello, 15+ more).</p>\n<p>We're a small team of 3 Silicon Valley veterans, well-capitalized by top Silicon Valley VC firms + angel investors. Both co-founders are engineers who worked at a VC firm, Eventbrite, and Digg. Our office is at 2nd and Market in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>We're looking to hire 2 senior/core engineers. You'll be building a top-notch Silicon Valley company with experienced founders going after a massive market: search. Electron experience (or desire) is a big plus, but we're open to other backgrounds too. My co-founder and I met ~5 years ago through a &quot;Who's Hiring&quot; thread so we're excited to see who responds to this one - please email me at ben@getcommande.com if youâre interested.</p>",

Our systems are critical to software engineers all over the world and used in every industry; from the public registry, which serves packages to open source engineers and small organizations, to our new enterprise solution, which provides single tenant registries for medium and large customers.</p>\n <p><strong>What Youâll Do</strong></p>\n <p>You are a capable engineer with a passion for working on products and a strong desire to grow. As a member on one of our cross-functional delivery teams you will work in a creative environment tackling complex problems. Our work has far-reaching impact and you will play an important role in the feature delivery by solving technical challenges driving the implementation.</p>\n <p><strong>Hereâs the impact youâll make and what weâll accomplish together:</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Support a modern software practice</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Follow processes, align work with guidance and goals, and work with other team members to deliver</li>\n  <li>Improve the frequency and quality of iterations over time through process, tooling, and providing feedback</li>\n  <li>Ensure work follows our evolving standards, guidelines and recommendations</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Support the product strategy</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Build features and experiences that reduce effort for our customers and generate tangible value</li>\n  <li>Assist in improvements to our technology stack in ways that will positively impact our customers and community</li>\n  <li>Maintain and evolve the codebase and systems in support of the portfolioâs roadmap</li>\n </ul>\n <p>If these are elements you are excited about and are interested in joining one of npmâs cross-functional teams dedicated to the mission of improving our products, this is the ideal role for you.</p>\n <p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience with JavaScript and/or Node.js</li>\n  <li>Knowledge of HTTP and experience with HTTP APIs</li>\n  <li>Knowledge of RDBMSs and SQL</li>\n  <li>Familiarity with one or more modern component based web UI libraries</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Great to Have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience shipping software in one or more cloud providers</li>\n  <li>Success building services in a microservice or SOA architecture</li>\n  <li>Experience with Docker and/or Kubernetes</li>\n  <li>Knowledge of one or more major CDN services</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Our Code of Conduct</strong></p>\n <p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior.</p>\n <p><strong>Why You Should Join</strong></p>\n <p>In joining the npm team, youâll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesnât ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we donât interrupt anyoneâs sleep.</p>\n <p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each otherâs assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p>\n <p><strong>Where We Can Hire</strong></p>\n <p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. <strong>We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico. </strong>We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/a1d7e38b-b259-4789-b880-5690fd002bb9' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

Our systems are critical to software engineers all over the world and used in every industry; from the public registry, which serves packages to open source engineers and small organizations, to our new enterprise solution, which provides single tenant registries for medium and large customers.</p>\n<p>What Youâll Do</p>\n<p>You are an experienced engineer with a passion for working on products and mentoring other engineers in technical areas. As a member on one of our cross-functional delivery teams you will work in a creative environment tackling complex problems. Our work has far-reaching impact and you will play a critical role by driving the feature delivery, solving technical challenges, and mentoring other engineers on your team.</p>\n<p>Hereâs the impact youâll make and what weâll accomplish together:</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Support a modern software practice</strong>\n<p>* Follow processes, ensure tasks are aligned with goals, and work with team members to deliver</p>\n<p>* Improve the frequency and quality of iterations over time through process, tooling, and providing feedback</p>\n<p>* Ensure work follows our evolving standards, guidelines and recommendations</p>\n<p>* Provide mentoring and guidance for other team members in areas of expertise</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Support the product strategy</strong>\n<p>* Build features and experiences that reduce effort for our customers and generate tangible value</p>\n<p>* Identify opportunities to improve our technology stack in ways that will positively impact our customers and community</p>\n<p>* Maintain and evolve the codebase and systems in support of the portfolioâs roadmap</p>\n<p>If these are elements you are excited about and are interested in joining one of npmâs cross-functional teams dedicated to the mission of improving our products, this is the ideal role for you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Qualifications</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Demonstrated ability and desire to mentor, teach, and lead others</li>\n<li>Experience delivering production services and/or public web sites with JavaScript and&nbsp;</li>\n<a href='http://node.js/' rel='nofollow'>js</a>\n<li>Familiarity with HTTP and experience building well-designed HTTP APIs</li>\n<li>Familiarity with one or more modern component based web UI libraries</li>\n<li>Success building services in a microservice or SOA architecture</li>\n<li>Knowledge of RDBMSs and SQL</li>\n<li>Experience shipping software in one or more cloud providers</li>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Great to Have</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Familiarity with distributed systems concepts</li>\n<li>Experience with Docker and/or Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Knowledge of one or more major CDN services</li>\n<p>Our Code of Conduct</p>\n<p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct&nbsp;.</p>\n<a href='https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct' rel='nofollow'>here</a>\n<p>Why You Should Join</p>\n<p>In joining the npm team, youâll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesnât ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we donât interrupt anyoneâs sleep.</p>\n<p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each otherâs assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups â women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p>\n<p>Where We Can Hire</p>\n<p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/643a9752-268f-4ae8-975f-9b33213b6313' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>\n</div>",

Your challenge will be to deliver a highly-available service on top of a dynamic collection of third-party data sources whose priority is anything other than making your job easy. Explore the limits of your own resourcefulness by designing human and automated systems that deliver true reliability in an otherwise unpredictable environment. \n  <br> \n  <br>See if you fit our requirements. \n  <br> \n  <br>For this role, we are looking for someone with the following characteristics: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* 2+ years experience building and managing a team of engineers \n  <br> \n  <br>* 5-10 years experience working in back-end applications \n  <br> \n  <br>* 2+ years experience working with front-end applications \n  <br> \n  <br>* Deep familiarity with ES6/NodeJS including deep understanding of promises, async/await \n  <br> \n  <br>* Bonus for familiarity with Chromium/Puppeteer and/or DOM manipulation/selection \n  <br> \n  <br>* Ability to acutely focus on company objectives and mission at hand. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Proven dedication to creating maintainable, functional, and reliable systems. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Ability to pass a background check; have appropriate work authorization \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>To achieve our mission, we always look for high-caliber people who share our core values: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Grit: Resilient problem solvers who finish what they start and love tackling problems of all sizes. We take critical feedback and push through to get the job done. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Collaboration: Egos can be left at home, our focus is on the best outcome, which means regularly challenging each other and being willing to be wrong. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Extreme Ownership: We sign up for big challenges and take extreme ownership to see it through. We make lemonade out of lemons when we have to and donât let frustration get in the way of getting it done. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Curiosity: Weâre passionate learners and get excited to nerd out over non-work related topics at a perhaps unnecessary level of detail. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Honesty: Weâre transparent and honest because thatâs the right way to treat other people.

Our systems are critical to software engineers all over the world and used in every industry. Our cross functional feature teams are responsible for the development and maintenance of various segments within our product portfolio. This includes the public registry, which serves packages to open source engineers and small teams, and npm enterprise, a single tenant registry as a service for medium to large organizations.</p>\n <p><strong>What Youâll Do</strong></p>\n <p>You are a strong technical leader with a passion for mentorship and product delivery. In leading this cross-functional team you will work in a creative environment tackling complex problems. Our work has far-reaching impact and you will play a critical role by driving the strategy and evolution of your teamâs product portfolio and the growth of individuals in your team.</p>\n <p><strong>Hereâs the impact youâll make and what weâll accomplish together:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Support a modern software practice\n   <ul>\n    <li>Ensuring adherence to good process, alignment with goals, and cohesion with team members</li>\n    <li>Improving the frequency and quality of iterations over time through process, tooling, and analysis of our systems holistically</li>\n    <li>Participate in development and evolution of standards, guidelines and recommendations</li>\n   </ul></li>\n  <li>Support a diverse team\n   <ul>\n    <li>Made up of product management, design, engineering, and QA in delivering on key outcomes for our products</li>\n    <li>Developing our talent with 1:1 coaching, professional development, goal setting and performance management</li>\n    <li>Reinforcing our commitment to inclusion through improvements to hiring practices and stewardship of team culture</li>\n   </ul></li>\n  <li>Support the product strategy\n   <ul>\n    <li>Building features and experiences that reduce effort for our customers and generate tangible value</li>\n    <li>Identifying opportunities for optimization, and leveraging data to drive continued enhancements</li>\n   </ul></li>\n </ul>\n <p>If these are elements you are excited about and are interested in helping npm guide and lead a cross-functional team dedicated to the mission of improving our products, this is the ideal role for you.</p>\n <p><strong>What Youâll Need To Be Successful</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience building / leading teams responsible for development, maintenance, and operation of large scale, distributed, web applications using Node.js and JavaScript</li>\n  <li>Experience leading a highly technical team in building SaaS products and services</li>\n  <li>Strong understanding of complex enterprise technology with the ability to introduce improved experiences and simpler processes</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Great-To-Have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Customer-facing product experience, including: customer journey mapping, customer research and interviews, customer support</li>\n  <li>Demonstrated experience improving your teamâs ability to deliver features at regular intervals that positively impact target metrics</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Our Code of Conduct</strong></p>\n <p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct here.</p>\n <p><strong>Why You Should Join</strong></p>\n <p>In joining the npm team, youâll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesnât ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we donât interrupt anyoneâs sleep.</p>\n <p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each otherâs assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups â women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p>\n <p><strong>Where We Can Hire</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico.</strong>&nbsp;We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/dc2e355d-84c9-46f2-b4fb-de3b47bbe4f3' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

You should be opinionated but you shouldn't be die-hard about your opinions because after all, maybe you're wrong (but maybe not?)</li>\n  <li>The understanding that any one line of code written can lead to catastrophic consequences if not thought out carefully!

You may not, but not challenging your thinking is unhealthy. We challenge each other a lot @Scratchpay.</li>\n  </ul>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Our culture</strong></p>\n <p>We care about the human aspect of work and we expect others to. Excellence is also an important keyword @ Scratchpay. While everyone makes mistakes, we learn from them. We are conscious about efficiency and effectiveness in the positive way.

Mediocrity isn't our cup of tea. But we always work hard to help those that are willing to get there!</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>The bad</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Everything goes fast and the ultimate goal is to move the business fast. There can be disconnects in the communication at times. We all need to navigate through this and push whenever it is critical to do so.</li>\n  <li>We are open-minded but things need to be moving forward.</li>\n  <li>We say what we have to. So expect to hear some unpleasant - but true - things sometimes. Don't hesitate to argue back - with respect - if you disagree.</li>\n  <li>Like any startup, It can be a mess some days. You also will likely have to do things that aren't in your scope sometimes. Part of the fun, right? ;)</li>\n </ul>\n <p>The most important is: We are always looking at improving. All the time, step by step. If you feel mediocre and don't see a path to improvement or can't listen to others' voice to, please do not apply.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/scratchpaycom/view/P_AAAAAAEAAJOCKSbYbl0GW1?trackingTag=stackOverflow' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Strong hardware</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Ample holidays</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Stock Options</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>A really cool team</span> </li> \n</ul>",

Generally, consumer frontends are written in React/ES6, and backends in Typescript (Express for REST APIs and native websockets for RTC). We use Redis as a message broker and Postgres as a persistent datastore. Our infrastructure is (mostly) on AWS. \n  <br> \n  <br>The most visually-prominent consumer product is the Koji IDE, a web-based editor that connects to a remote development server and enables full-stack development from any device with a browser. The remote development server uses Docker to create a per-project environment that runs both the editor server (file writes, PTY operations, OT-based real-time collaboration, Git operations, etc.) and the processes/servers required for the user to develop their project (backend servers, frontend dev servers, test runners, etc). \n  <br> \n  <br>At a high level, the web editorâs frontend uses VSCodeâs Monaco as a text editor and a custom parser that renders Koji-compliant JSON config files into intuitive visual controls. Because Koji projects are simply modern, standards-compliant Javascript projects (or projects that ultimately target JS), this hybrid approach gives our users the benefits of easy, visual configuration using no-code patterns for manipulating project-level config (strings, colors, styles, mechanics, settings, etc.) without subjecting them to the usual restrictions of no-code/low-code platforms (complex, unintuitive controls; ballooning trees/graphs once projects go beyond simple basics; no ability to drop down and edit native code; etc.). \n  <br> \n  <br>Because Koji projects are staged in the cloud during development, the web editorâs live preview can be opened on any internet-connected device (without the need for ngrok, mobile device proxies, etc.). The editor provides some additional tools for easily testing backend routes and manipulating PTYs. \n  <br> \n  <br>Koji projects are backend by Git repositories. By default, new projects use a Git remote hosted by Kojiâs Git server, but projects can also use repositories hosted by third-parties as their remotes. The Koji deploy pipeline uses Git hooks to trigger new builds (build steps are defined by a JSON file within the project) and shows build progress, logs, and notifications inside the web editor. Projects can deploy static bundles or dynamic services that are compiled, containerized, and deployed using Googleâs Cloud Run. \n  <br> \n  <br>Once a project is deployed, it can be accessed by an auto-generated subdomain. From within the editor, users can also register a custom subdomain on one of our root domains (e.g., myproject.withkoji.com), or register a custom domain name and configure DNS to point that domain to our CDN. We take care of HTTPS provisioning, deployment, and renewal automatically with Letâs Encrypt, and all projects are accelerated with our CDN partner, Fastly. \n  <br> \n  <br>The CDN that serves deployed projects can also inject plugins at runtime based on path/pattern matching, which lets users easily enable features like Open Graph tags (something that is typically difficult to do on client-side SPAs without SSR or services like Prerender) or integrate things like Google Analytics. The web editor also renders server access logs for deployed projects, giving users an easy way to understand traffic and growth without the need for any third-party analytics/tracking tools. \n </div> \n</div>",

The experiences they publish work consistently across all browsers and devices, and all customer engagement is tracked with extensive analytics. All without writing code.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Product</strong></p>\n <p>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of whatâs currently possible.</p>\n <p>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</p>\n <p>Weâre not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Chef, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Team</strong></p>\n <p>As part of the Ceros product team, youâll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people youâve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.</p>\n <p>We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you arenât afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much â whether itâs cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEOâs atrocious spelling.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Job</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Working completely from home, youâll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing. We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15 Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</strong></p>\n <p><strong>As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying),</li>\n  <li>having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,</li>\n  <li>carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,</li>\n  <li>agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,</li>\n  <li>collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,</li>\n  <li>and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Key things to know</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li><strong>This is a remote role</strong></li>\n  <li>We want you to start ASAP</li>\n  <li><strong>This is a full-time position</strong></li>\n  <li>Benefits</li>\n  <li>Competitive salary</li>\n  <li>Stock options</li>\n  <li>Premium health insurance</li>\n  <li>Commuter benefits</li>\n  <li>Generous PTO policy</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n <p>If youâre interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us. Weâre a company of passionate, honest, and sometimes silly people, so donât be afraid to express yourself.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='http://labs.ceros.com/jobs/#/job/1143553' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

Specifically, we believe that:</p>\n <p>â¢ Code, not graphical user interfaces, is the best abstraction to express complex analytic logic. <br></p>\n <p>â¢ Data analysts should adopt similar practices and tools to software developers. <br></p>\n <p>â¢ Critical analytics infrastructure should be controlled by its users as open source software. <br></p>\n <p>â¢ Analytic code itselfânot just analytics toolsâwill increasingly be open-source.</p>\n <p>If these sound like ideas you can get behind, weâd love to talk to you.</p>\n <p><strong>In this role, you can expect to:</strong></p>\n <p>â¢ Collaborate with the product and dbt core development team to develop our SaaS, dbt Cloud <br></p>\n <p>â¢ Build the next generation of UI components and platform features that will make dbt more accessible, delightful, and powerful <br></p>\n <p>â¢ Work with variety of programming languages, systems, and technologies (we primarily use Python, Postgres, Kubernetes, and AWS)</p>\n <p><strong>You are a good fit if you:</strong></p>\n <p>â¢ Have strong fundamentals in a variety of software development paradigms (e.g. object oriented, functional) <br></p>\n <p>â¢ Understand how to make tradeoffs to ship useful features today without sacrificing long-term quality <br></p>\n <p>â¢ Value interacting with end-users and deeply understanding their needs <br></p>\n <p>â¢ Are highly motivated and able to work autonomously</p>\n <p><strong>You have an edge if you:</strong></p>\n <p>â¢ Have worked on a small team developing and deploying a SaaS product <br></p>\n <p>â¢ Have direct experience scaling out data platforms, especially with Kubernetes and/or AWS</p>\n <p>At Fishtown Analytics, we are committed to hiring and cultivating a diverse team.

Weâre passionate about helping companies transform their static digital content into engaging experiences. From custom interactive microcontent, to immersive event microsites, you can build it with Ceros. Publish and update live content instantly, and embed it into your site instantly. Join us in ending the endless creation of static content and be part of the movement towards meaningful content experiences.</p>\n <p>We are well-funded and venture-backed by prominent investors including Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Product</strong></p>\n <p>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of whatâs currently possible.</p>\n <p>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</p>\n <p>Weâre not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Docker, Jenkins, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Team</strong></p>\n <p>As part of the Ceros product team, youâll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people youâve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.</p>\n <p>We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you arenât afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether itâs cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEOâs atrocious spelling.</p>\n <p><strong>About the Job</strong></p>\n <p>Working completely from home, youâll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing. We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15â Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</p>\n <p>As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying),</li>\n  <li>having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,</li>\n  <li>carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,</li>\n  <li>agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,</li>\n  <li>collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,</li>\n  <li>and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Key Things to Know</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>This is a remote role</li>\n  <li>We want you to start ASAP</li>\n  <li>This is a full-time position</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Competitive salary</li>\n  <li>Unlimited vacation days</li>\n  <li>Stock options</li>\n  <li>Premium health insurance</li>\n  <li>Excellent gear (15â Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>\n <p>If youâre interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us.

    "content": "CitizenMe is a London based start-up that aims to help people take control of their personal data and get value from it. This means putting data and the power of AI in the hands of people, not just organisations. We strongly believe that the data economy needs rebalancing. Personal data should not just be harvested and re-sold. Digital citizens should have control and be able to form trusted data relationships with brands, which will lead to stronger customer relationships.\n<br>\n<br>CitizenMe has an iOS and Android app where people can start to collect data about themselves and get value from it. In November 2017 we launched our self-service client portal, the CitizenMe Exchange, which allows organisations to request users of the CitizenMe app to exchange data for marketing, research, and digital strategy purposes.\n<br>\n<br>Job Description\n<br>The CitizenMe team is looking for a colleague who can lead the development effort across our web applications. We are looking for a person who is hands-on, happy to work with us in a lean &amp; Agile start-up sense, who is happy to experiment often, is metrics-driven and takes a holistic view of our product offering.\n<br>\n<br>We are offering our colleagues a very varied and cutting edge environment with an opportunity to truly grow and be a voice amongst equals from day one. There is also an opportunity for part ownership at an early stage of the company.\n<br>\n<br>Partial remote work is possible. Our office is in London and we will need frequent visits (at least a few days per 2-week sprint) to our office to help us plan and align our work across multiple workstreams.\n<br>\n<br>Skills &amp; Requirements\n<br>Extensive node.js (8.10+), HTML5 and CSS experience. Ideally python (3+) and perhaps even some Java (8+) experience too\n<br>Angular and React.js experience\n<br>Experience with Internet-facing applications.

In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we donât understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p>\n <p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p>\n <p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p>\n <p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p>\n <p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by âmakers.â Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p>\n <p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p>\n <p>While weâve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p>\n <p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li>\n  <li>Working on interesting technical problems that havenât been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li>\n  <li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li>\n  <li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li>\n  <li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li>\n </ul>\n <p>â¦you should reach out.</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Competitive Salary</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Stock Options</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Medical</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Dental</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Vision</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>401k</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Any computer / tech you want</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span> </li> \n</ul>",

They would also be eager to learn, grow, and foster healthy working relationships.&nbsp; If you have experience building production web applications and are as passionate about helping customers as you are about working with new technologies, then we want to talk!</p>\n <p><strong><u>What We Require</u></strong></p>\n <p><strong>Do you love to work directly with customers to solve business problems?</strong></p>\n <p>We believe great software is discovered by understanding the core problems our clients are facing â and that is best achieved through frequent and direct communication with the subject matter experts. We provide leadership to support and guide interactions, but we need you to be comfortable talking with clients, discussing problems, and proposing solutions, which may not always be more software.</p>\n <p><strong>Do you have experience writing production web applications?</strong></p>\n <p>We strive to support our team's growth, learning, and taking on new roles at the edge of our comfort zones. At the same time, our clients expect us to bring a certain level of expertise.

This requires the ability to self-direct and communicate well in writing. It also offers tremendous freedom and power, which comes with, uh, tremendous responsibility.

We only hire people who are fantastic teammates â competent and smart, sure, but also humble, positive, and generous.</li>\n  <li>Great Clients - We work with mostly small and medium clients, for whom our projects make a huge impact. We prioritize clients who are pleasant and good to work with, people who share our values of transparency and empathy.</li>\n  <li>Work From Home - We are a distributed company. Everyone works from home, though the leadership team all live in central Virginia.</li>\n  <li>Negligible Travel - In general, we don't travel routinely for projects. If this is a specific concern, we're happy to discuss.</li>\n  <li>Flexible Work Schedule - We require a certain amount of overlap with the rest of the team, but if you have a predictable schedule, we can probably support it, e.g., ending at 3:30 every day or being out every Friday morning.</li>\n  <li>Good Work Life Balance (really) - We ask our team to work 40 hours a week*. That's all: a good, productive 40 hours. And then we try our best to leave you alone off the clock. We do this in part because that's how we want to live but also because we want our team to be recharged and ready to do their best when working. *If you need to work fewer than 40 hours, that might be possible too; letâs talk.</li>\n  <li>Competitive Compensation - We offer highly competitive salary and benefits, including generous time off, 401k, FSA, medical and dental insurance.</li>\n </ul>\n <p></p>\n <span>Apply now</span>\n</div>",

We're completely redefining the meaning of &quot;data privacy&quot;.</p> \n<strong>It's a greenfield opportunity. We have:</strong> \n<ul>\n <li>A vision to make the transparency of data usage globally important. We want to make data-misuse and manipulation a thing of the past by giving every product and service in the world a permissions screen</li>\n <li>A wide-open green field of freshly baked services</li>\n <li>A young and pliable tech stack and infrastructure</li>\n <li>Energy and drive in abundance</li>\n</ul> \n<strong>We love awesome engineering, and awesome engineers:</strong> \n<ul>\n <li>We're playing with Docker, Typescript/NodeJS, Go, a smidge of Python, React, rapid prototyping, metrics-metrics-metrics and tight feedback loops</li>\n <li>We love autonomy and ownership, and believe in empowering our team</li>\n <li>We like polyglots! If you take like a duck to water with new languages, we don't care if you haven't used much of ours</li>\n</ul> \n<strong>You're curious, creative and smart...</strong> \n<p>And modest, too. Here are some of the other things that you have:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>A curious mind. A love for the question &quot;why&quot;</li>\n <li>Flexibility. Your peers say you can turn your hand to pretty much anything you set your mind to</li>\n <li>Good communication skills. We're a small team</li>\n <li>The ability to code (no surprises here). You are comfortable in two or more languages</li>\n <li>The ability to build fast</li>\n <li>A working knowledge of devops. You can spin up a cloud hosted prototype in a jiffy...</li>\n <li>... or have sufficient google skills to make it look like you already could</li>\n</ul> \n<strong>...and you have a wide set of interests:</strong> \n<p>Perhaps in your free time you've dabbled with front-end. Or painting. Or robots. Or a markov-chain Trump-tweet generator. In which case can you take it down please? It's currently running the United States.</p> \n<strong>Hey you said full-stack ... but &quot;dabbled&quot; with front-end?</strong> \n<p>Yes. We don't need you to be a front-end person. We're looking for a great engineer in general, not a specialism - and this is the closest tag we could decide upon. So if you've ever felt &quot;But I do lots of things! How do I present myself as capable doer of multitudinous things?&quot; then you're perfect. &quot;So do I need to build the front-end&quot; Nope!</p>\n<p>Unless that's your burning passion, in which case, hey, we'll hook you up.</p> \n<strong>What else? I want more. Open-source? Dev talks? Community?</strong> \n<p>Ok, we're going to be hitting the noise channels pretty hard to make a bit of a racket. We're engineers, and a lot of other engineers are getting on board with this idea of doing shared data &quot;right&quot;.</p>\n<p>So for us that means: meetups, blogging, tech talks, open-sourcing, spec-defining and platform designing. There will be lots of pizza and snacks because we're supposed to like pizza and snacks and Richard's pretty health conscious so there'll be some kind of vegetable presence too.</p>\n<p>And if you like the sound of having a voice in the community, we will absolutely make that happen.</p> \n<strong>Whoa whoa wait, what are you going to offer me? </strong> \n<p>Of course. We believe in hiring good people, and paying them well. This is a big role, it comes with a decent salary. We're also offering equity, because we want everyone to be in the same boat. Other perks that might interest you are:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>âï¸ We encourage employees to take at least one whole week off each quarter by giving them Â£250 to spend on some form of trip.</li>\n <li> Everyone gets Â£400 each year to spend on something which helps them learn such as online courses.</li>\n <li> Being healthy is important, so everyone has private medical insurance as well a healthy food in the office at all times.</li>\n <li> We proactively encourage flexible working. We're not at a stage to offer full-time remote, but people should work when and where they are most effective. We trust each other.</li>\n</ul>",

And this is your chance to help make a meaningful impact on the lives of people who struggle with their health by accelerating our ability to penetrate this market with our robust product offerings (see more below). \n  <br>To that end, our goal is to build the first billion-dollar brand thats 100% remote and need your help. \n  <br>To summarize the key points: \n  <br> * Salary: $110,000 - $140,000 \n  <br> * Location: 100% Remote \n  <br> * Benefits: Full Insurance (health, dental &amp; long-term disability) + Robust 401k \n  <br> * Hours: 8:30 a.m. 5:00 (and very flexible) \n  <br> * Culture: High-Performance but Humble (no jerks) \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Who are We Looking For? \n  <br>A full-time, senior, full-stack, brilliant, business-savvy web architect / web developer with heavy big data experience in the direct-to-consumer e-commerce space. Its a full-time, 100% remote position with a flexible work/vacation schedule as lifestyle is hugely important to our company. \n  <br>A curious mind, desire for autonomy while excelling in an open, truly collaborative culture of high performers makes would make you a perfect fit. These arent talking points. This is what we do, now. \n  <br>Were on pace to double this year and repeat that next year. To that end, we need more help tackling some very big engineering projects so we can handle our next leg of growth. Were laser-focused on recruiting someone with a business mindset who loves to solve big business problems by developing beautiful, efficient code and who enjoys having immediate, visible influence on the companys results. \n  <br>The ideal person is extremely results-driven and gets tremendous satisfaction from having their work see the light of day quickly and being motivated by seeing the impact it has. We want someone of who obsesses about and loves to code but also someone who loves to solve big business problems. \n  <br>Projects include everything from handling the massive system and data load that spending $1,000,000+ monthly on paid advertising brings, to building automated workflow tools to streamline internal operations, to developing sophisticated if/then logic in our billing code to handle the creative pricing and offers we use in our customer acquisition funnels. \n  <br>For example, we built our own all-in-one e-commerce system in 2012 as nothing handled the complex billing and funnel logic we needed to support our sophisticated B2C marketing strategies. However, now were moving over to the Shopify platform and strategically integrating our existing platform. That requires a complex analysis on which system does which part the best and building a smart integration. \n  <br>As another example, we build our own custom dashboards to precisely track our advertising efforts. To that end, we integrate with Google and Facebooks APIs to ingest all the data they provide. As a result, we end up with millions of rows of data a month that needs to be efficiently organized so we can use our BI tool to extract key business insights effectively. \n  <br>The ideal person is extremely self-motivated, loves to grind out work consistently and is comfortable being hands-on in all facets of web engineering from the browser-to-the-code-to-the-server. Experience with marketing funnels, e-commerce systems, split testing, sales analytics, conversion rate optimization is essential. \n  <br>We empower our developers with a lot of autonomy and responsibility for some very meaty projects that have very large $ impacts. To that end, this opportunity is suited only for a high-performing full-stack developer with an integrative mindset and proven ability to get things done cleanly and on time. \n  <br>You will work hand-in-hand with our CTO to optimize, support and manage our entire web infrastructure. You and our two other senior devs form our core development team of 4, covering for each other as vacation and other needs arise, while working synergistically on separate projects. \n  <br>Just as we obsess about creating metabolism-optimizing products that get the most results in the least time, were looking for someone equally obsessed about doing the same thing with efficient code. \n  <br>While your coding skills are important, it's how fast you process information, how quickly (and accurately) you can cycle through work and how well you work with the rest of our team that's crucial. To that end, communication is key to this role, as is the ability to self-motivate and quickly turn a business conversation into an actionable set of dev tasks that you can jump on immediately. \n  <br>Who is This Opportunity Perfect for? \n  <br>Anybody who truly is a top coder and creative architect who might relate to any of these: \n  <br>If youre tired of the commute, sick of burning the midnight oil, stress is dominating your life, and the cost of real estate is eating up your retirement, this is your opportunity to take back control, live life under your own terms and design a lifestyle that brings you joy, happiness and satisfaction. \n  <br>Or, if youve always wanted to be a part of the thrill of a rapidly growing company, but didnt want to move to an expensive big city with all the madness, stress and high cost that brings, this is your opportunity to stay where you are (or move to where you always wanted to go) to design your ideal life. \n  <br>Or, if youre drowning in the corporate world, suffocating from constantly shifting priorities that nobody agrees on, incessant scope creep, micromanaging bosses, endless meetings, constant interruptions and no respect for the quiet time you need to actually get work done, this is your opportunity to simplify and go deep to pour your heart and soul into ONE big opportunity and scale it like never before. \n  <br>Regardless of your situation, whether you prefer to work in the quiet of your own home, sipping a delicious cup of coffee at your favorite coffee shop, or outside enjoying the sunshine on a bright, beautiful day AND you are a humble, high-performing individual who would THRIVE in this type of environment, then please read on, as we cant wait to meet you. \n  <br> \n  <br>Benefits \n  <br> \n  <br>What You'll Enjoy from Us: \n  <br> * Competitive Compensation This respects the fact that you are a needle in a haystack, a true high-performer who any company would die for to have on their team. \n  <br> * Flexible Benefits While we offer an excellent benefits package, we can customize it to your specific situation, rather than forcing you to accept something that may not make sense for you. \n  <br> * 100% Remote A fantastic remote lifestyle with flexible hours when needed with ability to carve out time to do what you love. \n  <br> * Curated Team Peace of mind knowing we only recruit high-performing, humble people and that youll be surrounded by a supportive, high-energy team that respects you and your work. \n  <br> \n  <br> If this sounds like a good fit, if youre excited to do something challenging and meaningful that preserves your ability to enjoy life to the fullest, then please apply ASAP as we cant wait to meet you! \n </div> \n</div>",

But we always work hard to help those that are willing to get there!</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>The bad</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Everything goes fast and the ultimate goal is to move the business fast. There can be disconnects in the communication at times. We all need to navigate through this and push whenever it is critical to do so.</li>\n  <li>We are open-minded but things need to be moving forward.</li>\n  <li>We say what we have to. So expect to hear some unpleasant - but true - things sometimes. Don't hesitate to argue back - with respect - if you disagree.</li>\n  <li>Like any startup, It can be a mess some days. You also will likely have to do things that aren't in your scope sometimes. Part of the fun, right? ;)</li>\n </ul>\n <p>The most important is: We are always looking at improving. All the time, step by step. If you feel mediocre and don't see a path to improvement or can't listen to others' voice to, please do not apply.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/scratchpaycom/view/P_AAAAAAEAAJOCxs1V6XLeJO?trackingTag=stackOverflow' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Strong hardware</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Ample holidays</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Stock Options</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>A really cool team</span> </li> \n</ul>",
