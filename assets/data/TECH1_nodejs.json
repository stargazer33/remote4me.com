Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. We believe that diversity drives our vibe. We unite Elasticians across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p>We recently joined forces with a new team, Elastic Code Search and we are now looking to bring on board an experienced Software Engineer to join our globally distributed team.</p><p><strong><strong>What</strong>&nbsp;<strong>is</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Elastic Code Search?</strong></strong></p><p>Elastic Code Search is a IDE-like semantic code search solution built on top of the Elastic Stack. It helps development teams to search, navigate and collaborate on large code bases more efficiently. Known previously as insight.io, the product has been used and loved by tens of thousands of developers and received 5 star review on chrome store. YOU will be a founding member of Elastic Code Search team and a shaper of the Elastic Code Search product.</p><p><strong><strong>About The Role</strong></strong></p><p>The Software Engineer for Program Analysis will lead our effort to build standardized and open sourced language service that provides code intelligence for both static and dynamic languages. This is the core component of Elastic Code Search, powering core features such as jump to definition, find references and semantic aware search. You’ll also help pushing code intelligence to new frontiers such as integration with logging, APM, etc.</p><p><strong><strong>About you</strong></strong></p><ul><li>5+ year of professional software engineering experience</li><li>Previous work or open source experience on projects like IDE, compiler or static analysis software</li><li>Solid knowledge of compiler and static analysis</li><li>A Computer Science degree or comparable experience</li><li>Passionate about developer productivity</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Nice to have</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Experience with TypeScript</li><li>Deep understanding of build system</li><li>Experience with large-scale data store such as Elasticsearch</li><li>Related research experience</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Additional Information</strong></strong></p><p>We're looking to hire team members invested in realizing the goal of making real-time data exploration easy and available to anyone.

We work hard but maintain a casual work environment with a strong culture as a tech startup.

Our organization is adaptive, getting feedback signals from our users and systems. Right now we organize ourselves by projects, which allow us to build complex features and solve big problems, while staying mutable. As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We primarily do so through&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/Medi-Share/Medi-Share.aspx' rel='nofollow'>Medi-Share</a>, but as an association of churches, we’re rapidly expanding our “ministry portfolio” and we think technology will be at the center of accomplishing that goal. That’s where you come in. We need help creating and supporting applications (mobile + browser) for the future products and projects we’ve got in the proverbial “hopper.”</p><p>But before we go any further, you need to know if you’ll like working with us. We think you will.</p><p><strong>A bit about us:&nbsp;</strong>You already know the mission of Christian Care Ministry (CCM). We have about 580 employees in various states, but most of them are either at our headquarters in Melbourne, FL, or our Colorado Springs, CO branch. Medi-Share has been growing in every way imaginable since about 2010. It has become commonplace for our CFO to say things like “We’ve grown 30% year over year …again” at seemingly every quarterly employee town hall meeting. We’re extremely humbled and grateful to the Lord for the growth.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is a community of Christians that requires its employees to share its Christian religious beliefs and practices. CCM complies with all anti-discrimination laws applicable to religious employers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the role:</strong>&nbsp;This position serves on the New Product Engineering Team in a Product Team setting. This small, sub-department of our IT team (which is currently under 10 people) is mostly remote. Their main focus has been making some dreams of the leadership team come true (well, at least the dreams that involve amazing code :).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Life as an Employee with CCM’s New Product Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong>We work really hard to make working here an amazing experience. It’s hard to find great talent like you, but if you pick us, we want to keep you for a long time. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Do you prefer mountains or oceans?</strong></p><p>While the majority of the NPE Team is distributed, it is our overwhelming preference that you live near our Colorado Springs, CO office or our headquarters in Melbourne, FL.&nbsp; However, with modern tools, proximity doesn’t influence productivity and if absolutely necessary, we can discuss an exception. For this job in particular, we do need some collaboration though, so just make sure you have a reliable internet connection, of course.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>The New Product Engineering Team is operating in “start up” mode. This means that we work hard and smart to get projects completed in a reasonable timeline. On occasion, there may be instances when extra time is needed (usually around a product launch or a really big release), but those are pretty infrequent. Basically, we commit you to at least 6 hours of coding per day in our Sprints and as long as you get the work done, we’re okay with when you get it done. Just be available when the team may need your help, or when you may need their help. Sometimes life happens in the middle of the day, and we understand that. We also think “more meetings” means less time for coding so we protect your time. We have one morning stand-up at 10am EST where we find out when there could be overlap that day. Oh, one more cool thing about the only meeting you attend – we “eat our own dog food” and close each stand-up praying for Medi-Share members’ needs listed in our mobile app.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it by giving you those extra 2 hours per workday to collaborate or learn. The stack we generally work on is relatively new so taking time to hone in your skills is pretty imperative. We send members to conferences or webinars as we need to. We love seeing our people growing.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer…</strong></p><p>This is the part where we describe the experience necessary to be considered for the position.</p><p>You’re a skilled developer, but maybe you haven’t gotten a chance to prove it yet professionally. We can give you that chance.&nbsp;</p><p>But before you get _too_ excited, let me explain. We only hire great developers, and this position is no exception. When we ask you to write or debug code during our interviews, you’ll do so confidently. You might not be able to show us 5 applications you’ve shipped, but you can point to something recent you’ve spent significant time coding that you’re really proud of, like your university project, your open source contributions, or your project at your last job. If we ask your professors, classmates, or coworkers about you, they’ll have great things to say.</p><p>In short, we won’t teach you how to be a good programmer, since you already are, but we can certainly help you be a better, professionally-experienced programmer.</p><p>Our ideal candidate either has a college degree in computer science, or if not, 2+ years of recent, solid professional programming experience. Our especially ideal candidate has experience with either Node.js or React.js. Having only done that in your free time is fine. That tells us you are curious enough to learn on your own.</p><p>Our stack contains a very healthy JavaScript client utilizing Heroku, Node.js, React.js, and a few others. CCM is in the process of migrating to Salesforce so we often interact with their APIs. For our mobile apps we’re using React Native, because, well, basically, it’s awesome (and we really think our philosophies of “API First” and “Learn Once, Code Everywhere” are going to be the norm in the near future). Our backend API servers use either Ruby on Rails or Node.js/Express, with PostgreSQL and Redis as our data layer. Despite those being our “sweet spots” before we take on a new product, we pick the stack that works best for that solution.</p><p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are curious how things work, you are self-motivated and self-driven.</li><li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li><li>Thrive with directions like:<ul><li>“Here is the mock up for feature X. How do you think we should approach this?”</li><li>&quot;Check out the Jira story and play a bit with library X on GitHub. This might solve our problem Y. Let's discuss the pros and cons tomorrow.&quot; &nbsp;</li><li>&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it and why do you think that's a good idea?&quot;</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li><li>You got a smirk on your face when you saw you could work on the stack listed above, AT A MINISTRY!</li><li>As you’ve read this job description, you realize this team obviously is comprised of people who you’d enjoy spending a work week with. (ended that sentence with a preposition, we're not paid for our grammatical skills)</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p><ul><li>You already are a Medi-Share member or would want to join membership even if you didn’t work here.</li><li>You’ve built stuff using React Native (even if it was for your mom’s bingo club or something crazier).</li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>Super important stuff that sounds like it was written by lawyers:</p><p>This job description in no way states or implies that these are the only duties to be performed by the employee(s) incumbent in this position. Employee(s) will be required to follow any other job-related instructions and to perform any other job-related duties requested by any person authorized to give instructions or assignments. This document does not create an employment contract, implied or otherwise, other than an &quot;at will&quot; relationship.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is committed to&nbsp;serving&nbsp;the Lord and our membership with excellence. As&nbsp;employees&nbsp;we are&nbsp;committed to adhering&nbsp;to the same standard of Biblical principles of lifestyle and health as required for membership in our Medi-Share program which include:</p><ul><li>Have a verifiable Christian testimony indicating a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, and profess the&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/what_we_believe.aspx' rel='nofollow'><strong>Statement of Faith</strong></a></li><li>Attend a fellowship of believers, regularly and actively support that ministry, and live under the discipline of that body</li><li>Share the conviction that believers are to bear one another’s burdens according to Galatians 6:2</li><li>Believe the Biblical doctrine that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;are to be kept pure</li><li>Must not engage in sex outside of traditional Christian marriage</li><li>Cannot use tobacco or illegal drugs in any form, or abuse legal drugs or alcohol</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;How To Apply</strong></p><ul><li>Apply here. In your cover letter, introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.</li><li>Please include links to apps you’ve built or anything else that makes you look good, and describe your role in building those apps. (If they’re internal, you can skip the link part.)</li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for. Plus, you’ll see at our site we ask for a lot of the same info anyway.</li><li>Please complete the following questions, and include them with your cover letter. This shouldn’t take you very long.<ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? Is there another language that you’re curious to learn next?</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>In a 2-3 sentences, what has your life with Jesus looked like over the last 3 weeks? There’s no wrong answer.</li></ul></li></ul><p>There will be a few other things if we get past the first interview, but we’ll cover that later. We even like doing our hiring on an iterative basis.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/christiancareministry/jobs/1215334' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Onsite gym</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>15 days PTO</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>$621/month flex earnings for health coverage</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

To help share a bit more about life at Zapier, here are a few resources in addition to the job description that can give you an inside look at what life is like at Zapier.

Regardless of how well you feel you fit our description, we encourage you to apply if:<br><br>You're motivated by building effective engineering teams and are happy to roll up your sleeves and dive into code when needed.<br><br>About You<br><br>You are a skilled engineer.&nbsp;You've got a strong background working in our stack (React, ES6, Node.js, etc.) -- even if you aren't a daily coder, you regularly exercise your coding muscles and try to be an asset on any technical context your team may need.<br><br>You are an effective team builder. This isn't your first rodeo. You know how to hire, train, and develop engineers from all backgrounds. You understand the benefits of building a diverse and inclusive engineering team. You may not have hired or managed hundreds of people before, but you have hired, trained, and managed at least a few engineers before.<br><br>You're adaptable. You've been in fast growing companies and know how to build, change, and adapt to the needs of a company as it grows.<br><br>You have excellent communication skills. You regularly work with engineers and other stakeholders from various disciplines, balancing engineering concerns, such as technical debt, with product concerns.

That said, here are some things you'll probably do:<br><br><br>* Help the team build tools for partners and developers that come to our platform to create Apps that live on Zapier. Imagine Postman meets OpenAPI on steroids!<br><br>* Develop effective ways to communicate, monitor, and lead your team through weekly one-on-one’s and team meetings.<br><br>* Keep the leadership team informed on your team’s progress in ways that are easy and enjoyable to receive, like one-on-one's, update posts, and regular team hangouts.<br><br>* Build rapport with each member of the Front End Engineering Team and support them through coaching and mentorship to help level up their skills.<br><br>* Participate in code reviews, learning and spreading technical knowledge throughout Zapier -- moving knowledge to documentation where appropriate.<br><br>* Occasionally dive into the code; fixing bugs, improving developer experience, smoothing edges -- sometimes even spiking out small proofs of concept.<br><br>* Collaborate across various disciplines (Product Managers, Designers, Researchers) to help set technical roadmaps that will achieve business goals through engineering best practices.<br><br>* Actively recruit, onboard, and train new engineers at Zapier. This might involve tweaking the skills portions of interviews, or writing better documentation.<br><br>* As part of our&nbsp;All Hands Support&nbsp;initiative, help customers have the best experience with Zapier as possible.<br><br><br><p>See more jobs at <span>Zapier</span></p></div></div>",

    "content": "*About TRACK*<br /><br />There has been a huge shift in how we interact and engage with the financial services we use day-to-day. Products from Monzo to Clearscore have changed everything from our current accounts, to our savings & investments, to our pensions. We now demand clarity, transparency and simplicity – driven by new tech, delivered with beautiful UX. <br /><br />The area of finances TRACK is particularly interested in is people’s homes. For most, a home is the biggest asset they will ever own, the most expensive purchase they will ever make, and the main outgoing in the monthly budget. But beyond finances, there is perhaps nothing with a greater impact on our families, futures, and plans. <br /><br />TRACK is a mobile and web application seizing on an opportunity to give people complete visibility over their home - acknowledging that it’s both a financial asset and a personal one too. <br /><br />Our mission is to simplify property finances by presenting them beautifully, instantly and in one place, so homeowners know where they stand and can make smart decisions. <br /><br />TRACK’s founders have VC-backed startup experience, an exit, and deep knowledge of the property sector and its challenges. Find out more about our story, company and the product on &quot;our website&quot;:https://www.wearetrack.co.uk<br /><br />*Our Culture and Brand Values*<br /><br /># Celebrate each win, but always push for the next one<br /># Care about the work you do, and the impact you can make<br /># Ask why and be curious; justify your position while keeping an open mind<br /># Appreciate great design and delightful simplicity in all areas of the business<br /># Value and build meaningful relationships<br /><br />*The Role*<br /><br />Having just closed our first round of investment, we’re starting to build our team. This is our first hire, so you’ll be integrally involved in building the business, working with experienced founders to shape the technical/product direction of TRACK. This is a great opportunity to build something from the ground up. You’ll play a key role in decisions about architecture, frameworks and technologies, along with the processes that’ll make our dev team one of the best around.<br /><br />*Stuff you'll do*<br /><br />* Make key decisions about the tech we use – decide what you think is best<br />* Lead the development of our codebase, building on what we’ve got so far*<br />* Setup processes from scratch in everything from dev ops to testing<br />* Build a stellar team around you <br />* Plan and drive sprints, manage a small distributed team<br />* Work with UI/UX designers and product managers in a cross-functional team<br />* Care deeply about how we solve our customers’ problems<br /><br />*Backend: PostgreSQL, Google Cloud, Node.js || Frontend: React Native + iOS UI kit<br /><br />*The following probably describes you*<br /><br />* Experience as a senior or lead developer in an early-stage environment<br />* Pragmatic and results-focused under the pressures of a startup<br />* Love solving big problems in a smart way<br />* Fantastic technical mind, with full-stack development expertise<br />* An appreciation for good design and UX<br />* An excellent communicator – written and verbal<br />* Adept at crossing the chasm between attention to detail and big picture<br />* Optimistic attitude – you can see the best in bad situations<br />* A good technical degree from a leading university<br /><br />*The Offer*<br /><br />* Competitive salary<br />* Stock options, or equity for the right candidate<br />* Health & Wellness allowance<br />* Flexible working hours and unlimited holiday<br />* Choose and spec your hardware<br />* Shoreditch office with all the startup mod cons",

As part of the engineering team, you will join a group of experts from mobile development, AI, product design, and more. Your role will span the most crucial parts of our growing company. Because this is a startup, your responsibilities will change day-to-day, however, your work will fall into these crucial categories: API development, core infrastructure, cloud operations, data mining &amp; reporting, feature development, and stability engineering…PHEW, that's a lot to take in!</p><p>While the list of responsibilities is wide-ranging and can seem daunting, the goal for a back-end engineer at PeerWell is to build systems and processes to improve the experience and have the confidence we are providing a service with high quality and consistently to people struggling with musculoskeletal issues. The challenge for this role is to develop the platform with the needed precision and scalability to support millions of people.</p><p>You will work with all members of the team and you'll report directly to the VP of Engineering. As we are a small team, you will work directly with the CEO and members of other teams including Sales, Marketing, and Design. The team is built of successful entrepreneurs and business leaders, all of whom love to educate and help others improve.</p><p>About You</p><p>You are a 5-star generalist that loves working on hard problems and solving them with code. You are equally comfortable building a React app as you are at writing scripts to mine data. You are naturally curious to learn new ways to build things or how to improve performance. You care a lot about how readable your code is and take great pride in how well tested it is. A broken build is your biggest pet peeve.</p><p>You are also able to connect your work to the larger mission of helping patients in the time of need. You understand that the people using your products are chronic pain sufferers and the code you write is a small step towards helping them deal with that pain. Those small steps add up to people being able to go back to work, spend meaningful time with their families, and live a normal life.</p><p>Outside of code, you are learning about new technologies like the blockchain, recurrent neural nets, augmented reality, and more. You like to share what you've learned with others on your team and be creative about how these technologies can be introduced within the products we build.</p><p>Requirements</p><p>Hard Skills<br>    1. 3-5 years experience writing production code<br>    2. Experience with Node.js, React, Javascript, Python, MongoDB, AWS<br>    3. 3+ live, production projects<br>    <br>Soft Skills<br>    • Strong communication skills<br>    • Reason from first principles<br>    • No ego<br>    • Equal interest in learning and teaching<br>    • Entrepreneurial<br>    • Thinks like an owner<br>    • Active listener<br>    • Impeccable organization skill</p></div>",

    "content": "<h2> Open Source Engineer</h2><div>Developer<br></div><div>Anywhere<br></div><div>Company: npm<br></div><div>Full Time<br></div><h3>Overview</h3><p>npm is the world’s largest software repository, with 11 million users and over 15 billion software package downloads every month. We maintain hundreds of open source modules, among those the npm CLI, one of the most active projects on Github. In order to ensure that the millions of users of our software can find the support they need to be successful we are cultivating a community of javascript developers.</p><p>Our challenges extend beyond simply writing code or engineering software. We need you to help us grow our software, grow our users as engineers, and help turn our users into contributors.</p><p></p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong><p>Do you have a passion for making your fellow developers’ lives better? Do you want to have an impact on the daily lives of millions of engineers? Do you want to be on a team that cares deeply about the success and welfare of the contributors to their projects? If yes, this role could be an excellent fit for you.</p><p></p><strong>In this role you will</strong><ul></ul><li>mentor members of our community in providing contributions to our projects and the javascript community as a whole</li><li>introduce new features that have either been proposed by internal product management or via our public RFC system</li><li>support and advocate for npm’s open source community and communicate with them through&nbsp;and other public venues</li><a href='http://npm.community/' rel='nofollow'>community</a><li>organize our bi-weekly releases</li><li>maintain and further improve the codebase of the CLI to make it even more stable and easy to change</li><p></p><strong>What We Value</strong><p>Our team values stability, communication, action, sustainability, empathy, and reflection. We work collaboratively to find the best solutions to problems. We write and speak constantly about our work, both to improve our own thinking about it and to communicate with one another and our users. Because the team is small, we also value creativity, and continual process improvements. Your work at npm will make every JavaScript developer in the world faster and happier.</p><p></p><strong>Our Code of Conduct</strong><p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct&nbsp;.</p><a href='https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct' rel='nofollow'>here</a><p></p><strong>Why you should join</strong><p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p><p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p><p></p><strong>Where We Can Hire</strong><p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We are hiring humans from around the globe. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. If you have experience working remotely, so do we. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas other than TN-1s, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p><div> <div><div><p> <br><br> <b>To apply for this job please visit the URL below.</b> <br><br> Please reference <b>Jobspresso</b> in your job application, so that remote companies know where their best candidates are coming from  <br><br> <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npmjs/a69b70b9-efbb-45b5-a67e-bfc249849d53' rel='nofollow'>https://jobs.lever.co/npmjs/a69b70b9-efbb-45b5-a67e-bfc249849d53 →</a></p></div></div></div>",

This isn’t learning, it’s remembering, and it’s useless for equipping people with the practical skills and experience they need to face an ever-changing world. We believe in something better…</p><p>Social Constructionism is a learning-centred approach that prioritises exploring, making and iterating real-life&nbsp;STEAM&nbsp;projects in a social, collaborative way. Our award-winning pi-top laptop and pi-topCEED desktop computers are powered by the Raspberry Pi and come with a host of projects and accessories which allow any teacher, regardless of their computer literacy, to design fun and engaging lessons across&nbsp;STEAM&nbsp;subjects and beyond. Learners are empowered to work together, at their own pace, designing and refining their inventions by asking questions and ultimately Learning by Making.</p><p>Since our founding in 2014, we have built a strong global community of teachers and makers who constantly shape our worksheets, lesson plans and content. We provide access to hundreds of hours of educational resources for the Computer Science (CS) and&nbsp;STEAM&nbsp;curriculum that improves digital literacy.</p><p>However, we’ve only just got started, and this is where you come in. With secure funding in place, we’re poised to accelerate our growth and take our approach out to the world.

Imagine this:&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div>Log in to your Slack app when you start the day and high five the team already on ! Our team is all over the world, but we're always overlapping hours working together to innovate and move the company forward.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Review any development updates in Slack from your teammates on new code development, urgent tickets, new bug fixes, or what's new in the system for that day. Communication is always key here in a fast moving company!</div><div><br></div><div>Log into Clubhouse (agile ticketing) and Github, review the sprint for that week and what the next tickets in that sprint on deck are. You can check in with our Director or Engineering to organize any priorities or make sure that your product story is being done right in regards to long-term scalability. You’ll want to commit those branches to Github and then launch them live on our Staging environment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our QA lead can then head over and test the ticket in staging and make sure things are looking good. Move that ticket over, once approved, and we’re on to the next big win! (Product Owners will confirm the story, move to our clean release servers and we’ll prepare to release on production deployment days).</div><div><br></div><div>We're here to help our users as well, so that means sometimes taking a look at customer tickets coming in on priority from the Support team and getting those bug fixes moving quickly. Some days we’ll work on priority bugs and others on new tickets (Most days a combination of both ).</div><div><br></div><div>It'll be important that you keep communication strong with the team, QA, and support on what’s going on and where!</div><div><br></div><div>Then, you can high five your teammates again when you log off and update the team in Slack with your daily update!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once a week, we'll review the sprint, goals, and any major issues plus we’ll meet monthly to look where to improve for better internal systems across the company. And if it’s a Friday, we might pop a few beers (or mimosas) together on Demio and cheers to a great week!</div><div><br></div><div><b>What we’re creating together:</b></div><div><br></div><div>At Demio, we are creating a culture of excitement and growth, driven by results. We believe that day-by-day actions &amp; consistencies create lasting success; it’s the little things that matter.

While the webinar, web-communication space has been around for a while and continues to grow, we believe that we’re creating an entirely new segment in the market and doing it in a simple way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the Position:</strong></p><p>Our team is small, but nimble.

We'll do everything we can to make a stress free, easy to navigate operation inside so your role is just as simple as our platform!</p><p>Not only will you be remote, but you get to work with a team that is hungry, smart, and eager to make an impact. As a major member of that team, your work will never go unnoticed. Your work will ALWAYS make large waves in the company.</p><p>We have a philosophy for our company that revolves around our team,&nbsp;<strong>we strive to work with A-Players</strong>. A-Players, in our opinion, are people who cannot accept anything that is less than great.</p><p>But hey, we also like to have fun ; we understand that building a company is quite the journey, and it can be incredibly hard, so we believe that it’s important to enjoy the moments along the way (mimosa Friday’s, anyone? )</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About You:</strong></p><p>We want someone to join our team who truly desires to make an impact, is growth oriented, is constantly striving to improve, highly responsible for their actions, a great communicator, focused on output and results, and understands that great companies are built one small step at a time.</p><p>From an engineering perspective, here’s a short list of what you’ll be responsible for:&nbsp;</p><p>Developing scalable and reliable backend applications for our live / automated webinar platform</p><ul><li>Working with Engineering team members to organize, delegate, and tackle sprints in an agile and efficient manner</li><li>Weekly working on developing new features, bug fixes, code refactoring, and new product objectives</li><li>Excellent communication/english skills and ability to work well with remote teams (excellent verbal and written english skills)</li><li>Following coding best practices and developing appropriate testing and deployment scripts.</li><li>Monitoring and developing standards for platform load/usage with recommendations for improving performance. (nothing is ever “perfect”)</li><li>Take ownership of problems and develops innovative solutions to solving them</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What languages should you know?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Well, you should have vast experience with a wide range of different programming languages, but at the same time, you should always be willing to learn &amp; grow more. We know not everyone knows every language.</p><p>Our ideal candidate has:</p><ul><li>At least 5 years of PHP experience (Phalcon PHP Framework would be a plus, but not required)</li><li>At least 5 years of MySQL experience</li><li>At least 5 years of JavaScript experience</li><li>At least 1 year of React.js experience</li><li>Experience with Amazon EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk usages is a plus.</li><li>Working knowledge of MongoDB, and traditional SQL architectures.&nbsp;</li><li>Have handled RESTful API connections and 3rd party API integrations via API</li><li>Node.js experience is a plus, but not required</li><li>Experience with Docker is a plus, but not required</li></ul><p>Here’s what our stack currently consists of:</p><ol><li>Our Streaming platform is built in React.js, Node.js, Socket.io, MongoDB, and WebRTC.</li><li>Our User platform is built in PhalconPHP, React.js, MySQL and a RESTful architecture.</li><li>Our iOS Mobile App is built in ReactNative and connects to WebRTC (but may be getting redone here shortly)</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What does the average day look like in Demio? Imagine this:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Log in to your Slack app when you start the day and high five the team already on ! Our team is all over the world, but we're always overlapping hours working together to innovate and move the company forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Review any development updates in Slack from your teammates on new code development, urgent tickets, new bug fixes, or what's new in the system for that day. Communication is always key here in a fast moving company!</p><p>Log into Clubhouse (agile ticketing) and Github, review the sprint for that week and what the next tickets in that sprint on deck are. You can check in with our Director or Engineering to organize any priorities or make sure that your product story is being done right in regards to long-term scalability. You’ll want to commit those branches to Github and then launch them live on our Staging environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Our QA lead can then head over and test the ticket in staging and make sure things are looking good. Move that ticket over, once approved, and we’re on to the next big win! (Product Owners will confirm the story, move to our clean release servers and we’ll prepare to release on production deployment days).</p><p>We're here to help our users as well, so that means sometimes taking a look at customer tickets coming in on priority from the Support team and getting those bug fixes moving quickly. Some days we’ll work on priority bugs and others on new tickets (Most days a combination of both ).</p><p>It'll be important that you keep communication strong with the team, QA, and support on what’s going on and where!</p><p>Then, you can high five your teammates again when you log off and update the team in Slack with your daily update!&nbsp;</p><p>Once a week, we'll review the sprint, goals, and any major issues plus we’ll meet monthly to look where to improve for better internal systems across the company. And if it’s a Friday, we might pop a few beers (or mimosas) together on Demio and cheers to a great week!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What we’re creating together:</strong></p><p>At Demio, we are creating a culture of excitement and growth, driven by results. We believe that day-by-day actions &amp; consistencies create lasting success; it’s the little things that matter. We’re creating the freshest, most innovative ideas for software that helps marketers flourish.</p><p>Having the freedom to propose and execute even your most out-there ideas for the company and getting all the support and coaching you need to be your best. All in a fun and positive way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the pay for this position:</strong></p><p>The salary will be based on experience and your background as a Backend Engineer. We're looking for the RIGHT person, but we want to make sure you are excited about your paycheck too! Estimated starting pay is between 60 - 90k/year with lots of room to grow!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Growth-oriented bonuses we believe in:</strong></p><ul><li>Minimum 2 Weeks Paid Vacation</li><li>Reimbursement for Kindle Ebooks/Audible</li><li>Paid Access to Digital Courses for extended training</li><li>Free Gym Membership&nbsp;</li><li>Reimbursement for 1 local Tech Event a month</li><li>Working with a truly mission driven team motivated by excellence</li><li>huge room for growth</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What to send when you apply:</strong></p><p>In your reply email, send us a few things to let us know more about you.</p><p>1. Send over a quick review of work you’ve done or developed with relation to the stack above. Any open source projects including GitHub Repo’s work as well.&nbsp;</p><p>2. A résumé is cool but not necessary, feel free to include any and all recommendations from past colleagues or employers (LinkedIn works :D )</p><p>3. Tell us about you personally, stuff you’re into – what your goals are, where you are in life and where you want to be in life. This may not be your dream job, but who knows maybe we can work together to help it become so!</p><p>4. What’s your favorite book?</p><p>5. BONUS! Include a video of yourself telling us a little bit about yourself – just post it on Vimeo/YouTube/etc. This will greatly increase your chances of an interview! :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take your time to articulate your thoughts, there’s no prize for submitting quickly. No need to write everything, but this is a great way for us to learn about your ability to communicate and be thoughtful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That’s it! We look forward to meeting you!</p>",

Communication is always key here in a fast moving company!</div><div><br></div><div>Log into Clubhouse (agile ticketing) and Github, review the sprint for that week and what the next tickets in that sprint on deck are. You can check in with our Director or Engineering to organize any priorities or make sure that your product story is being done right in regards to long-term scalability. You’ll want to commit those branches to Github and then launch them live on our Staging environment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our QA lead can then head over and test the ticket in staging and make sure things are looking good.

(Product Owners will confirm the story, move to our clean release servers and we’ll prepare to release on production deployment days).</div><div><br></div><div>We're here to help our users as well, so that means sometimes taking a look at customer tickets coming in on priority from the Support team and getting those bug fixes moving quickly. Some days we’ll work on priority bugs and others on new tickets (Most days a combination of both ).</div><div><br></div><div>It'll be important that you keep communication strong with the team, QA, and support on what’s going on and where!</div><div><br></div><div>Then, you can high five your teammates again when you log off and update the team in Slack with your daily update!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once a week, we'll review the sprint, goals, and any major issues plus we’ll meet monthly to look where to improve for better internal systems across the company.

The mechanism we use to do this is counterintuitive, but once grasped will genuinely change the way you think about blockchain. We are proud to be supported by the smartest people in Asia:</p><p><a href='https://medium.com/@SaitoOfficial/saito-raises-2-million-usd-in-seed-round-5d53e830188a' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/@SaitoOfficial/saito-raises-2-million-usd...</a></p><p>Right now we are looking to hire three people. We need someone great with UI/UX who can help us improve our core blockchain applications (email, payment channels, social networks and more). We need an experienced engineer to help develop features in our core code (currently NodeJS), and we need a network scaling engineer to help us push network capacity between Asia and North America to its theoretical limits among other things. We have some write-ups here:</p><p><a href='http://org.saito.tech/jobs/open-positions/' rel='nofollow'>http://org.saito.tech/jobs/open-positions/</a></p><p>Things you should know about us: we are a smaller team (four people) planning to be in Beijing for about a year. And while we're not committed to China long-term and expect to be flexible with remote work eventually, we do need anyone who joins us to spend a non-trivial amount of time in Asia this coming year. We can also guarantee this is an adventure worth taking. Interested? Please message me directly -- questions on the job or our scaling method all welcome -- my email address is in my HN profile.</p></span>",

We build services, munch data and process real-time information in all things transit - and we’re looking for a backend engineer in the Berlin office to join us in our effort to provide great public transit APIs as one of the pillars for moovel’s rapidly expanding mobility platform.<br></p><p><b>FIRST A QUICK LOOK AT US</b><br>Our vision is a planet without traffic jams. Our mission is to transform cities by providing the most convenient and sustainable mobility solutions. We create outstanding products with technical excellence, an agile mindset, an open feedback and failure culture and fun at work. moovel is part of a large global corporation (Daimler AG), but at the heart of it we still are a startup. We act as a partner for cities, transport networks and mobility service providers with the goal of making cities smarter and creating an operating system for urban mobility that provides access to appropriate mobility options in urban areas and paves the way for the future with autonomous vehicles. Currently, 250 employees work in small creative teams in Germany and the US at four locations - Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart and Portland.</p><p><b>HOW THE ROLE WORKS</b><br>We gather in small engineering teams organized around specific topics. The individual teams enjoy a high degree of autonomy, trust and responsibility. Innovation is key and very much encouraged and embraced in our teams. We value pragmatism, simplicity and collaboration. We live an open feedback and failure culture, because we know that both are necessary to find proper solutions.<br></p><p>With us you’ll use state of the art technology and work self-determined in small, autonomous and agile teams. moovel tries to maintain a culture where engineers are provided with the toolsof their choice and a friendly environment in which they can thrive.<br></p><p><b>SOME OF THE THINGS YOU WILL DO</b><br>Teams at moovel choose the tools they regard as best fit for their problems, at their discretion. Hence the technology stack is rather diverse. We employ a microservice backend architecture based on Docker and AWS. Cloud Services are leveraged wherever they help us to focus on our task. We practice Continuous Delivery and value DevOps culture (you build it, you run it). On the Frontend (IOS, Android and Web) we adopted and embraced Technologies like Swift, Kotlin, Rx or React.<br></p><p>Breaking down concrete tasks for this position is not that easy, but that's what makes it so exciting. Here are some things we want to entrust you right away:<br></p><p></p><ul><li>You write, monitor, scale and architect microservices that comprise our transit backend<br></li><li>You build infrastructure and tooling for importing data into our data stores<br></li><li>You develop services using Node.js &amp; Python<br></li><li>You perform analysis to enable data driven decisions<br></li><li>You write processing pipelines in Python<br></li><li>Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define, design and ship new features<br></li></ul><p><b>ABOUT YOU</b><br>You should have experience in writing, maintaining &amp; debugging web services. You should be concerned about quality and maintainable code. Some exposure to functional programming, async concepts and micro services would be useful. While having working experience in the Node.js or Python web stack is a plus, it’s not a show-stopper in case you’re flexible and well versed in alternatives like Rails or Play. Since we are working in a rapidly evolving environment you should be open to pick up new languages, tools and frameworks. Furthermore, we are working with Amazon Web Services so it would be good if you are familiar with cloud technologies and methodologies like 12 Factor.<br></p><p></p><p>You should be familiar with SQL. Additionally, it would be nice if you have experience with any of Elasticsearch, Lucene, Solr or similar search technologies.<br></p><p>As it is our corporate language, you should have good written and verbal communication skills in English.<br></p><p><b>BENEFITS</b><br></p><p></p><ul><li>Choose your own hardware<br></li><li>Working with newest technologies &amp; microservices<br></li><li>Company pension plan<br></li><li>Free breakfast, coffee &amp; water<br></li><li>Mobility allowance<br></li><li>Be part of an interdisciplinary team of experts<br></li><li>Working on products with a high impact on society<br></li><li>International teams<br></li><li>Child care allowance<br></li><li>Flexible working hours<br></li></ul><p><b>Sounds good?</b><br>We are more than happy to meet you soon!

Imagine this:&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div>Log in to your Slack app when you start the day and high five the team already on ! Our team is all over the world, but we're always overlapping hours working together to innovate and move the company forward.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Review any development updates in Slack from your teammates on new code development, urgent tickets, new bug fixes, or what's new in the system for that day. Communication is always key here in a fast moving company!</div><div><br></div><div>Log into Clubhouse (agile ticketing) and Github, review the sprint for that week and what the next tickets in that sprint on deck are. You can check in with our Director or Engineering to organize any priorities or make sure that your product story is being done right in regards to long-term scalability. You’ll want to commit those branches to Github and then launch them live on our Staging environment.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Our QA lead can then head over and test the ticket in staging and make sure things are looking good. Move that ticket over, once approved, and we’re on to the next big win! (Product Owners will confirm the story, move to our clean release servers and we’ll prepare to release on production deployment days).</div><div><br></div><div>We're here to help our users as well, so that means sometimes taking a look at customer tickets coming in on priority from the Support team and getting those bug fixes moving quickly. Some days we’ll work on priority bugs and others on new tickets (Most days a combination of both ).</div><div><br></div><div>It'll be important that you keep communication strong with the team, QA, and support on what’s going on and where!</div><div><br></div><div>Then, you can high five your teammates again when you log off and update the team in Slack with your daily update!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Once a week, we'll review the sprint, goals, and any major issues plus we’ll meet monthly to look where to improve for better internal systems across the company. And if it’s a Friday, we might pop a few beers (or mimosas) together on Demio and cheers to a great week!</div><div><br></div><div><b>What we’re creating together:</b></div><div><br></div><div>At Demio, we are creating a culture of excitement and growth, driven by results. We believe that day-by-day actions &amp; consistencies create lasting success; it’s the little things that matter.

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.<br>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. Thats a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.<br><br> <br>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, FT, Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Australian Herald to name a few. Hundreds of thousands of families have downloaded the RoosterMoney app since our launch in January 2016. We are looking for a talented and motivated senior UI developer to join our team to help us achieve even more amazing things. We have a generous share option scheme and youll be joining us as we expand across a number of new territories. <br><br><br>THE ROLE:<br>We're looking for a software developer who has held mid-senior positions on front-end engineering teams, who will operate with a high level of autonomy. <br>You will be developing our core RoosterMoney app and working across the platform as a whole within our small but growing product team (currently 8), building an application that is used by families around the world. You have a passion for UX and UI, best practice development and building a product that delights users on a daily basis, taking pride in shipping quality code that is easy to test, maintain and build on. You care deeply about building applications with well thought out architecture.<br><br><br> Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node APIs where required.<br><br><br>We are a small team so its important that the successful candidate isnt just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.<br><br><br>Apply if you want to:<br> * Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.<br> * Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.<br> * Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.<br> * Develop robust deployment and testing processes <br> * Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.<br> <br><br><br>Benefits<br><br>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> <br> * Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.<br> * 25 days holiday<br> * Pension Scheme<br> * Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.<br> * We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office. We run a Remote working structure as a team (we currently have team members in London, Bristol and Stoke in the UK and Barcelona, Spain) so time zone variance (and travel distance) has to be sensible. <br> <br><br><br><br>We can't offer visa sponsorship at this time. <p>See more jobs at <span>Roostermoney</span></p></div></div>",

We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.<br><br>* We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear. We do our work with respect, and we value truth, transparency, and honesty above all else.<br><br><br><br><br>Nice to Have:<br><br><br>* You have real-world experience with Nuxt, React, or Vue.<br><br>* You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.<br><br>* Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation<br><br>* Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI<br><br>* Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals<br><br>* Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA<br><br><br><br><br>To Apply:&nbsp;<br><br>If you are interested, please apply with a resume and introduction.&nbsp;<br><br>Please feel free to skip the formality of a cover letter and write to&nbsp;me as a human being.&nbsp; If you need to use a four letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I’ll take that over what you would think I typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are and what you want in life.
