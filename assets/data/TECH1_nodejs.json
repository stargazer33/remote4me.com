Inside our rooms, we take you on thrilling adventures and transform you into new characters. Our experience is like the movies, except you’re actually with your friends inside the movie.</p><p>We are a team of successful startup veterans with deep experience in VR, gaming, technology and hospitality. We’re funded by leading global tech investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Alibaba.</p><p>Since we launched in 2017, we’re now live in 8 locations and 6 countries around the world (4.5 stars on Yelp, and the #1 Activity in Hong Kong and Singapore on TripAdvisor), and we’re quickly expanding.</p><p><strong>What will you be doing?</strong></p><p>As an early engineer at Sandbox VR, you’ll have a huge impact on our product. This is a full-stack Javascript position, so you’ll be working closely with the rest of our team building our core online software experience and touching all aspects of our code and stack including web infrastructure, APIs, and frontend tech.</p><p>This team has the challenge to tie together the online and offline experience across web, device, virtual reality, and physical retail through a novel digital experience. You will help us build this software and stack from the ground up and help define our engineering culture. You will be a significant code contributor.</p><p><strong>Who are we looking for?</strong></p><ul><li>You consider yourself a fullstack Javascript engineer over anything else. Your passion is keeping up with the ever-changing JS landscape and hacking with the newest JS tools. You consider React and Node your future.</li><li>Experience with our stack: React, GraphQL w/Apollo, TypeScript, NodeJS, Postgres, Redis, Kubernetes, Google Cloud Platform</li><li>We value ownership highly—the ability to take an idea through all the stages from conception to shipping a product. This reflects throughout our company but is especially true in engineering.</li><li>You love building new things with modern tools<strong>.</strong> You can hack together ideas without compromising stability, security, code integrity or the user experience. You know what it takes to ship software and understand a path from MVP to scaling a product and codebase. You understand how to design systems in a distributed manner. We build and release frequently and look for those who share that passion.</li><li>You will also help architect our internal systems and processes including analytics, release engineering, monitoring, data management, and other components of small team software development.</li><li>Sandbox VR is a distributed team – reliable internet access is our only requirement.</li></ul><p><strong>How can you really impress us?</strong></p><ul><li>If you’ve been a founder in the past, that would be a huge plus. Especially if you’ve failed – our CEO and our President both are failed founders and we enjoy being the underdogs trying to create the impossible. Failed founders fit right in with us.</li><li>If you’ve been an early team member of a startup, we’d love to hear about your experience at different stages of growth. Shipping software evolves as the team size evolves. Understanding how to be scrappy and yet build for the future is an art.</li><li>Have you worked in a distributed engineering team before and have examples of what worked and what didn’t to stay closely connected with your peers? Working remotely isn’t for everyone, and we work tirelessly to best fit into each other’s workflows while minimizing disruptions as possible.</li><li>If you’ve worked in a continuous deployment environment in the past and can clearly articulate the benefits and costs of continuous deployment vs integration, we’d love to hear about it!</li><li>If you’ve been an engineering leader, we’d love to hear that as well. Helping recruit and manage talented contributors is important to this role long-term and your growth is tied to the growth of the team.</li></ul><p><strong>How do I apply?</strong></p><p>If you’re interested in this role, please apply here, or find some other way to get in touch if you’d really like to stand out. We’d like to see at least a CV or LinkedIn, and a quick cover letter/email/blurb on why you’re the right fit for us.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Bryan</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/sandboxvr/76e4c4a2-153f-4e7a-a950-af68e698385d' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Expect to travel at least two times a year: once for our all-hands meetup and again for a team retreat (each ~4-5 days).</li><li>We believe in a focused approach to collaboration, where individual team members work on a single top priority at a time, each supporting larger, company-wide objectives.

The Yoto ecosystem revolves around a curated library of stories, music, activities, sound effects, podcasts and radio. Children listen to the content on Yoto Player, a safely connected speaker that is controlled using physical cards with NFC technology. Additionally the Yoto App allows parents to retain a level of control, enabling volume control, remote play and more.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We launched our first hardware product, Yoto Player, on <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yoto/yoto-a-clever-speaker-for-kids/'>Kickstarter</a> in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and receiving a Red Dot Design award in the process.

We offer imperfect (yet delicious) produce, affordable pantry items, and quality meat and dairy. We deliver them conveniently to our customers’ doorsteps and pride ourselves on offering up to a 30% discount compared to grocery store prices. Our customers can get the healthy, seasonal produce they want alongside the grocery staples they rely on, without having to compromise their budget or values. We’re proving that doing the right thing for the planet doesn’t have to cost more, and that shopping for quality ingredients can support the people and resources that it takes to grow our favorite foods.\\n\\nWe're headquartered in San Francisco with operations all over the country. Check our website to see if there is an Imperfect near you!\\n\\nWe're looking for folks who are positive, motivated, and ready to change the world. If that sounds like you, drop us a line!\\n\\nHere at Imperfect, we are all about groceries on a mission. Since 2015, our services have saved over 40M lbs of food, 1.2B gallons of water, and 110M lbs CO2, while donating 3M lbs of food along the way. Our software engineering team builds the eCommerce platform and internal tooling that makes this all possible. The team partners closely with product management to develop features, solutions, and systems that enhance and transform the user experience. Engineers don’t just build widgets -- we participate in the full lifecycle of a feature, from conception to release. We’re a remote-first team, with members located throughout the US.

Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.</p><p><strong>Our company</strong>:</p><p>Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.</p><p><br>More information:<a href='https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/' rel='nofollow'> https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/</a></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/287824?reset=False&amp;ra=1ywGIJdBrCCs&amp;oqs=a%3D1ywGIJdBrCCs%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>                    <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>International environment with distinctive colleagues</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Feedback culture to help everyone grow</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly learning seminars</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Yearly company trip</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Several trips to our HQ in Copenhagen per year</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Budget for conferences</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Have an impact on the industry that powers global trade</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Every company is becoming a software company and developers are at the center of this shift. They need better tools and building blocks so they can stay focused on innovating. One of these building blocks is identity: authentication and authorization. That’s what we do. Our platform handles 2.5B logins per month for thousands of customers around the world. From indie makers to Fortune 500 companies, we can handle any use case. We like to think that we are helping make the internet safer.We have raised $210M to date and are growing quickly. Our team is spread across more than 35 countries and we are proud to continually be recognized as a great place to work. Culture is critical to us, and we are transparent about our&nbsp;<a href='https://auth0.com/blog/the-developer-first-identity-platform-auth0-story-and-future' rel='nofollow'>vision and principles</a>.Join us on this journey to make developers more productive while making the internet safer!<strong>What's the opportunity?</strong>As we scale Auth0 and handle billions of logins per month, we also have to deal with&nbsp;<strong>billions of attacks</strong>. Almost 40% of our traffic are bots trying to get access to our customers accounts and our job is to not let that happen.At the same time we want to provide a great experience to our users and let them know when something suspicious is going on: someone logged in from a device that was not seen before; from a place that would be impossible based on previous activity; from a TOR node; etc.Finding the&nbsp;<strong>right balance between security and user experience</strong>&nbsp;is a hard problem to solve.

Since 2015, our services have saved over 40M lbs of food, 1.2B gallons of water, and 110M lbs CO2, while donating 3M lbs of food along the way. Our software engineering team builds the eCommerce platform and internal tooling that makes this all possible. The team partners closely with product management to develop features, solutions, and systems that enhance and transform the user experience. Engineers don’t just build widgets -- we participate in the full lifecycle of a feature, from conception to release. We’re a remote-first team, with members located throughout the US. This role will report to the Head of Engineering and can be remotely located within US time zones. We have exciting growth ahead of us as we evolve from only produce to a full-service grocery, as well as expand our footprint to serve an even greater portion of the country.
