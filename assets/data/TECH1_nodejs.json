We're building from the ground up the second version of our industry leading mobile/web application in Meteor and React.<br><br><br></div><div>Live and work from anywhere, while learning new things, working on a product thousands of people love to use every day.<br><br><br></div><div>Our company is successful, self-funded, profitable, twenty people strong, and growing. We've developed a fantastic culture that embraces adventure in business, engineering and lifestyle. Please join us!<br><br><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>About Us<br></strong><br><br></div><div>Pathable (<a href='https://pathable.com/' rel='nofollow'>pathable.com</a>) is the leading provider of community software for conferences, tradeshows, events, and associations. Our software serves in-person, virtual and hybrid events of all shapes and sizes -- we're improving the entire experience of attending and throwing complex events and conferences. Though we develop products delivered over the Internet, as a nearly 10 year-old profitable company, we're not quite a startup anymore.<br><br><br></div><div>We're fortunate to have room to innovate and experiment as we develop new products and services. Managed and majority owned by the original founders, we've got the freedom to chart our own course -- our only influence is what's best for our customers.<br><br><br></div><div>From the beginning, our culture has supported and embraced remote workers. We don't have an office and the Pathable family lives or is traveling in over 10 countries. Our members enjoy more time with their children, living in remote and unusual places, or exploring the world; all while growing professionally and building things about which they are proud.<br><br><br></div><div>We're building features in our recently finished new version, it was built from the ground up, using the latest tools available at the time, integrated everything we've learned from nearly 15 years of product development to the same market.<br><br><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>What We're Building<br></strong><br><br></div><div>We have a single product composed of five different Meteor applications including a Mobile Native app.<br><br><br></div><div>We use Meteor, MongoDB, React and related technology to develop our second generation Meteor based web and mobile application. Our team includes core committers to Meteor and we lovingly embrace open source contributions to a variety of projects.<br><br><br></div><div>We deploy code weekly, often daily, to our AWS-based Galaxy clusters.<br><br><br></div><div>We use constraint solvers to model and solve complex scheduling problems.<br><br><br></div><div>We test everything with Cypress.<br><br><br></div><div>While we don't code pair, we aggressively review each others code via pull requests and video presentations.<br><br><br></div><div>We use TargetProcess and Slack, with frequent video calls via Zoom or Google Hangouts.&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div>And much more!<br><br><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>About You<br></strong><br><br></div><div>You love working with JavaScript, React, NodeJS and related technologies.<br><br><br></div><div>You've probably released open source software.<br><br><br></div><div>You love to learn new technologies and embrace change. You are open to whatever technology, processes or techniques will improve your ability to deliver high quality software as quickly as possible.<br><br><br></div><div>You thrive in a remote working environment where you may never meet your co-workers in person; you go wherever you want. You want complete control over your development and working environment. You understand how essential clear, consistent communication is when working remotely -- ambiguity makes you uncomfortable.<br><br><br></div><div>You enjoy vigorously defending what you know to be right as much as you enjoy being wrong when the best answer wins. You're loath to have your co-workers discover bugs you've missed.<br><br><br></div><div>You'll write beautiful, well tested JavaScript both in the browser and on the server. You'll improve quality and reliability by bug hunting and writing Cypress tests.<br><br><br></div><div>You'll work directly with people in the entire company to design core product features, which you'll release and see used by hundreds of thousands of users.<br><br><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>Benefits<br></strong><br><br></div><ul><li>Accrued paid vacation</li><li>Paid holidays</li><li>Full medical+dental benefits for US workers</li><li>Medical insurance stipend for non-US workers</li><li>Yearly self improvement stipend</li><li>Monthly stipend for co-working space</li></ul><div>&nbsp;<br><br><br></div><div><strong>How To Apply<br></strong><br><br></div><div>Please first attempt our <a href='https://github.com/pathable/vnext-code-challenge/blob/master/README.md' rel='nofollow'>coding challenge</a> and then apply <a href='https://jsco.re/5e40u' rel='nofollow'>here</a>, including your a link to your solution.

    "content": "NASA EVA Mission Systems | Software Engineer | Houston, TX | INTERNS, ONSITE, REMOTE (maybe, see below)<p>We are looking to hire interns who can help build several products in support of ISS [0] and lunar EVAs [1]. The primary project is working on a procedure authoring tool which handles multiple actors working in parallel. We are making EVA procedures human and machine readable, and transforming procedure authors' workflow from a cumbersome process of sharing Word documents to something closer to a software development workflow. Part of this project includes getting non-programmers to use Git to maintain their procedures without them having to know much about Git, by building Git into our application and abstracting away many of its confusing details.</p><p>We are looking for interns for summer, fall, and spring, and prefer people who can support multiple semesters in a row.</p><p>Tech: NodeJS, React, Electron</p><p>Regarding REMOTE possibilities: Due to COVID-19 it _may_ be possible to support remote hires. This is not something we've done for interns in the past, but we're pushing for it since everyone is remote now anyway. I cannot guarantee it will happen, but if you're interested in this position but can only support remotely, I recommend applying.</p><p>How to apply: NASA interns apply through a generic process, so your application will be made available to a wide range of employers. Also, like any good bureaucracy, there is more than one process for application. Here are two of them:</p><p>Application process 1: Contact Linda Drobnich at Linda.Drobnich AT sjcd DOT edu.</p><p>Application process 2: Create an account at intern.nasa.gov and search for &quot;EVA Informatics / HHP Model - 17500&quot;. The specifics for this posting are out of date, and will soon be updated to match what I wrote above.</p><p>I recommend applying to both application processes. In either case, let me know you applied so I can look for you (either as a comment here or emailing me at &lt;my-hn-username&gt; at gmail dot com).</p><p>[0] ISS: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station</a></p><p>[1] EVA: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity</a></p>",

Experience with any or all of the following technologies is a plus: Node.js, React, TypeScript. Startup experience valued.</p><p><strong>Our company</strong>:</p><p>Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.</p><p><br>More information:<a href='https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/' rel='nofollow'> https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/</a></p>            </div>        <div>            <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/287824?reset=False&amp;ra=1ywGIJdBrCCs&amp;oqs=a%3D1ywGIJdBrCCs%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>                                <span>Easy apply</span>            </a>                            </div>",

We expect everyone to understand&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;they are working on a particular activity or objective, being clear on how it will benefit the business and our customers.</li><li><strong>Be proactive and dependable:&nbsp;</strong>Everyone can solve problems and remove barriers to growth — both personally and for the company. We are quick to raise issues and ideas, and to recommend next steps. We make it easier for others to feel they can depend on us by being proactive in our communication and action.</li><li><strong>Pay attention to detail:&nbsp;</strong>We believe the quality of everything we do is a competitive advantage. We expect high attention-to-detail, whether it's in how we write an email, review our analytics, or design the site. We delight in getting the details right, even in internal documents. High attention to detail isn’t something you turn on and off — it’s an attitude.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Always look to improve:</strong>&nbsp;We survive and grow by constantly looking for opportunities to improve our solutions, our processes and ourselves. We own our mistakes, using them as an opportunity to learn what changes we should make to processes and tools. We expect our people to proactively look for opportunities to develop and improve our own performance.</li><li><strong>Enjoy the journey:&nbsp;</strong>We consider our health and families to be more important than work. We ensure no-one feels that they are frequently required to work excessive hours. We support each other in overcoming problems and achieving work and life goals. We’re positive and enthusiastic — helping everyone feel energized to take us to the next level. We don’t pin our happiness on the attainment of a particular end goal - we delight in every step along the way.</li></ol><p>We don’t just ‘say’ these are our values.

We will pay you $500 per game.&nbsp;These are simple games, so they shouldn't take you too long to create. Interested? Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 72 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>            </div>        <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>            Apply        </a>                            </div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives.
