We are in need of an enthusiastic&nbsp;self-starter with expertise in&nbsp;Node.js, React, and other technologies.\\n\\n\\nWhat We Do\\n\\n\\nWe work with niche companies in the US, Canada, the UK&nbsp;to restructure and automate their operation so that their businesses can grow 5-10x. We do that by effectively analyzing their business, streamlining their processes, and designing an effective automation solution that we then implement on our robust IT stack.\\n\\n\\nWe make extensive use of technologies that help us accomplish results with less work — making everyone inside of our global organization more effective.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nWe heavily leverage:&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nAmazon AWS's serverless technologies and microservices for our front-end, back-end, and mobile apps (Lambda, Amplify, Cognito, S3, etc.).\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nZoho's CRM and ERP Tools (Desk, Books, etc.).\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nVonage/Nexmo-based telephony and communications solutions (Vonage Business Phone, Nexmo Voice/SMS, OpenTalk, etc.).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are always looking for new technologies and welcome team members adding things to our technology stack so we can deliver more results more effectively.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nWhat You Will Do\\n\\n\\nAs an Engineer, you will be responsible for delivering the solution as per requirements put together by our Creative and Business Analysis Teams. Depending on your level, you will be responsible for either the entire project (with other engineers working in your project team) or for a part of it.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nYour ultimate&nbsp;deliverable will be to effectively build a solution that will be implemented in the client's business and run successfully going forward.\\n\\n\\nIn doing so, you will:\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nDesign and architect complex solutions involving web apps (front+back), custom CRM/ERP's, programmable telephony, and occasionally mobile apps.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nDeliver and implement your solutions.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nCreate effective monitoring of the solutions for effective usage and scalability.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nDo anything else you deem necessary to accomplish your result.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\nYou are:\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nResponsible and driven by results.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nGenuinely interested in technology.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nWilling to learn, grow, and admit mistakes.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nAble to communicate with other people on the project's team effectively.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou&nbsp;have:\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nA solid knowledge of Node.js, React, SQL and NoSQL databases to&nbsp;build our front and back end solutions.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nExperience with APIs to integrate applications with each other.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nEffective written and verbal English to communicate with our international team.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nBasic understanding of DevOps and SDLC to cooperate with other developers in building the product.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWill be a good plus:\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nExperience with Amazon AWS, serverless technologies, and microservices on its platform.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nExperience with CRM and ERP systems such as Zoho and others.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat We Offer\\n\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nResults-Focused Approach to Work\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe do not look at people's activities, the number of lines of code written, etc., as the measure of success. We look strictly at the results&nbsp;in effectively delivered products.&nbsp;\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nFinancial Rewards for Exceptional Results\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuccessfully completed projects serve as the basis for financial bonuses and compensation plans.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nFreely Arranged Schedule\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou decide when you want to work. What we expect from you are results. There is a daily stand-up call — but outside of it, you can manage your schedule as you prefer.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nWork as an Engineer, Not Just a Coder\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur Engineers work to build solutions and not just to write code. You will have freedom in how you want to&nbsp;architect the solutions you are making and we will heavily encourage initiative on your part.\\n\\n\\n* \\n\\nGrowth Within Our Organization\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe are a dynamic and growing organization with a team spread around multiple continents. If you prove yourself as a responsible, driven and motivated individual, there will be opportunities for you to lead projects and manage tech teams.\\n\\n\\nOur candidate selection process is designed to assess people strictly by their merit. We do not make you go through a long round of interviews, instead, we follow a straight-forward sequence:\\n\\n1.&nbsp;Job Application Form.\\n\\n2.&nbsp;Online Skills Assessment.\\n\\n3.&nbsp;Interview.\\n\\n4.&nbsp;Paid Practical Assignment.\\n\\n5. Evaluation and Offer.  </div> </div>",

The primary project is working on a procedure authoring tool which handles multiple actors working in parallel. We are making EVA procedures human and machine readable, and transforming procedure authors' workflow from a cumbersome process of sharing Word documents to something closer to a software development workflow. Part of this project includes getting non-programmers to use Git to maintain their procedures without them having to know much about Git, by building Git into our application and abstracting away many of its confusing details.</p><p>We are looking for interns for summer, fall, and spring, and prefer people who can support multiple semesters in a row.</p><p>Tech: NodeJS, React, Electron</p><p>Regarding REMOTE possibilities: Due to COVID-19 it _may_ be possible to support remote hires. This is not something we've done for interns in the past, but we're pushing for it since everyone is remote now anyway. I cannot guarantee it will happen, but if you're interested in this position but can only support remotely, I recommend applying.</p><p>How to apply: NASA interns apply through a generic process, so your application will be made available to a wide range of employers. Also, like any good bureaucracy, there is more than one process for application. Here are two of them:</p><p>Application process 1: Contact Linda Drobnich at Linda.Drobnich AT sjcd DOT edu.</p><p>Application process 2: Create an account at intern.nasa.gov and search for &quot;EVA Informatics / HHP Model - 17500&quot;. The specifics for this posting are out of date, and will soon be updated to match what I wrote above.</p><p>I recommend applying to both application processes. In either case, let me know you applied so I can look for you (either as a comment here or emailing me at &lt;my-hn-username&gt; at gmail dot com).</p><p>[0] ISS: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station</a></p><p>[1] EVA: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity' rel='nofollow'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extravehicular_activity</a></p>",

Startup experience valued.</p><p><strong>Our company</strong>:</p><p>Did you know that 90% of all goods globally are transported through a container, and the largest container vessels are 400 meters long and can transport 20,000 containers at a time? The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry. We have received $5M in funding to expand the team in order to serve our increasing customer traction.</p><p><br>More information:<a href='https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/' rel='nofollow'> https://www.portchain.com/careers/full-stack-software-engineer/</a></p>            </div>        <div>            <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/287824?reset=False&amp;ra=1ywGIJdBrCCs&amp;oqs=a%3D1ywGIJdBrCCs%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>                                <span>Easy apply</span>            </a>                            </div>",

We expect high attention-to-detail, whether it's in how we write an email, review our analytics, or design the site. We delight in getting the details right, even in internal documents. High attention to detail isn’t something you turn on and off — it’s an attitude.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Always look to improve:</strong>&nbsp;We survive and grow by constantly looking for opportunities to improve our solutions, our processes and ourselves. We own our mistakes, using them as an opportunity to learn what changes we should make to processes and tools. We expect our people to proactively look for opportunities to develop and improve our own performance.</li><li><strong>Enjoy the journey:&nbsp;</strong>We consider our health and families to be more important than work. We ensure no-one feels that they are frequently required to work excessive hours. We support each other in overcoming problems and achieving work and life goals. We’re positive and enthusiastic — helping everyone feel energized to take us to the next level. We don’t pin our happiness on the attainment of a particular end goal - we delight in every step along the way.</li></ol><p>We don’t just ‘say’ these are our values.

We will pay you $500 per game.&nbsp;These are simple games, so they shouldn't take you too long to create. Interested? Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 72 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>            </div>        <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>            Apply        </a>                            </div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p><p>While we’ve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p><p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p><ul><li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li><li>Working on interesting technical problems that haven’t been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li><li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li><li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li><li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li></ul><p>…you should reach out.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Any computer / tech you want</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
