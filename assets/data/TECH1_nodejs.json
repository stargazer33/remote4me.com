Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. Elastic is backed by $104 million in funding from Benchmark Capital, Index Ventures, and NEA; has headquarters in Amsterdam and Mountain View, California; and has employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong>Kibana is the window into the Elastic Stack</strong></p><p>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developer who wants to add to Kibana and X-Pack? We want to meet you!</p><p><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Innovate, lead and contribute to front end and visualization experience of the Kibana and other UI products using JavaScript</li><li>Collaborate with other development teams, quality engineering team, and documentation team to execute on product work</li></ul><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Strong JavaScript programming skills</li><li>7+ years of front end development work</li><li>Experience with one modern MVC style JS Framework</li><li>Experience writing automated tests</li><li>Ability to work in a fast paced start-up environment</li><li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills, a great teammate with strong analytical, problem solving, debugging and troubleshooting skills</li><li>Strong preference for operational experience</li><li>Strong preference for knowledge of building complex data visualization and related tooling</li><li>Strong preference for Open Source experience</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><ul><li>Deeply competitive pay, medical, dental, vision, disability, benefits</li><li>Stock options</li><li>Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices</li><li>An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life</li><li>Passionate people building great products</li><li>Employees with a wide variety of interests</li><li>Your age is only a number.

We learned a lot of interesting things along the way about the right way to ship software, and we're now bringing our incredible software product experience to larger companies like <b>Verizon, Google, Intel, Twitter, Sony, L'Oréal</b>— and we do this all with a fully distributed team.</div><div><br></div><div>We believe that well-made software can change the world, no matter how small or simple a product might be. We also believe that poorly-made software —badly-designed, badly-developed, or badly-supported— is a preventable tragedy.</div><div><br></div><div>Mokriya’s mission is to make great software: for ourselves, for our clients and most importantly for our users.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About You</b></div><div><br></div><div>You love to build.

It’s fun to work at Mokriya because beyond the perks and good times, we’re a happy team of people who love to design and build great products. It’s not just that we have a great organizational structure in which everyone is really empowered to act; it’s also that we hire for fit and bring in folks only if we’re confident in their integrity, capability, and drive.</div><div><br></div><div>No one will watch over your shoulder, and you won't have to spend time watching over anyone else's either.

We believe each member is equally valuable, and we treat them as such. We are looking for a top-notch back end Architect who can make the important tech choices, be hands-on in developing those choices, and grow a small engineering team to assist. Initially, you will be wearing many hats as is typical in the start-up realm.<br /><br />You will be responsible for the Architecture, Roadmap, and Development of the application. Please note we are open to various technology platforms. The person we are looking for has a vast back end mobile application development experience and can guide us on best practices. Slot gaming knowledge is a strong plus, but it’s not necessary if you’re willing to learn. You must also be strongly self-directed, good at managing timelines, and good at working independently and as a team member as this is very collaborative.<br /><br />Our offices are located in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles – Remote work is fine.<br /><br />The Tech Stack<br />You get to influence this! Currently, we're thinking the back end will be in Java. <br />We're also considering Go, Rust, Python, Node.js, or even C# - if you can make a strong case as to why being locked into the Microsoft infrastructure is preferable. Come to us with strong opinions and a willingness to discuss engineering trade-offs.<br /><br /><br />Experience we are looking for:<br /><br />    You must have worked on back end projects deployed for iOS, Android, and/or both.<br /><br />    We want someone who has developed a mobile app and has been on a small team. Show us that you’ve had ownership of some part of a program you’ve worked on.<br /><br />    Start-up experience is really nice to have. Gaming experience is a plus.<br /><br />    It'd be nice if you've led a team in the past, as this position has the opportunity to grow into a managerial role as we grow the company.<br /><br />    You must have sysadmin / operations experience and be able to set up infrastructure for the app, preferably in a cloud context - systems, network, monitoring, security, etc. <br /><br />We plan on making a number of build-or-buy decisions so experience with integrating third-party tools and/or services is a plus.<br /><br />    Also a huge plus: experience scaling a consumer-facing service, particularly with respect to tuning for performance and reliability."

Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. Elastic is backed by $104 million in funding from Benchmark Capital, Index Ventures, and NEA; has headquarters in Amsterdam and Mountain View, California; and has employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.<br><br>Kibana is the window into the Elastic Stack<br><br>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.<br><br>Are you a top Javascript developer who wants to add to Kibana and X-Pack? We want to meet you!<br><br>Engineering Philosophy<br><br>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort.

Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.<br><br>Responsibilities<br><br><br>* Innovate, lead and contribute to front end and visualization experience of the Kibana and other UI products using JavaScript<br><br>* Collaborate with other development teams, quality engineering team, and documentation team to execute on product work<br><br><br><br><br>Skills &amp; Requirements<br><br><br>* Strong JavaScript programming skills<br><br>* 7+ years of front end development work<br><br>* Experience with one modern MVC style JS Framework<br><br>* Experience writing automated tests<br><br>* Ability to work in a fast paced start-up environment<br><br>* Excellent verbal and written communication skills, a great teammate with strong analytical, problem solving, debugging and troubleshooting skills<br><br>* Strong preference for operational experience<br><br>* Strong preference for knowledge of building complex data visualization and related tooling<br><br>* Strong preference for Open Source experience<br><br><br><br><br>Additional Information<br><br><br>* Deeply competitive pay, medical, dental, vision, disability, benefits<br><br>* Stock options<br><br>* Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices<br><br>* An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life<br><br>* Passionate people building great products<br><br>* Employees with a wide variety of interests<br><br>* Your age is only a number.

We focus on long-term cooperation in projects and we collaborate with clients from around the globe. Besides the Czech Republic, they are from Spain, Germany and USA at the moment. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Our clients include advanced start-ups as well as bigger and well-established companies and their internal start-ups. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>What will your working day look like</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>Ben Loop was founded by two freelancers and, perhaps, that’s why we put great emphasis on personal freedom. </span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>You can start when you want in the morning and decide yourself where you’re going to work.

Nobody checks anybody as for when and how they work – only the results are important. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>During the day and at the end of it, we commit the work to Github where another developer always performs Code Review for you after you complete a task.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Who we are looking for</b></span><br></div><div></div><div></div><div><span>We are looking for developers for long-term cooperation from Europe or Brazil who has</span><span> experience with Node.js &amp; React</span><span> and have </span><span>an active</span><span> open source profile.

An ambitious goal, PatientPal automates several difficult tasks that are still mostly human-run today. Through automation we’re improving efficiency, reducing errors and mistakes, and saving clinics and patients time and money. Unfortunately, it is not simple to automate healthcare, so PatientPal is a very goal-oriented company.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to join a passionate team and make a difference in healthcare. We focused on keeping PatientPal affordable for our customers and keeping PatientPal robust, flexible, low cost to operate, and therefore affordable to a wide array of clinics, providers, hospitals, and professionals.</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>We are completely serverless. Relying on modern FaaS, we scale instantly and maintain a low operating cost. Experience with Lambda, DynamoDB, or similar technologies is a plus.</li><li>We are HIPPA compliant. This requires training and requires us to handle data securely. We provide training, but experience or knowledge in encryption, network security, information assurance is a plus.</li><li>We integrate with a lot of services. Rather than recreate, we integrate. We work with lots of APIs, services, and medical industry protocols that will jar the mind of most modern developers. Experience using deprecated APIs, working with difficult integrations that lack documentation, or direct experience with using medical industry standards such as HL7, FHIR, CDA, CCD, X12, DICOM, EDI, and similar protocols is a major plus.</li><li>We are building a modern tool, that is easy to use. The frontend application is in Angular 6. Experience with Angular or similar frontend frameworks is a plus.</li><li>We are accessible to any patients. PatientPal cares about the patient experience. Experience building international, multilingual, and accessible applications is a plus.</li><li>We rely on high quality, self-tested work. We do not have a QA team, but we have a lot of automated testing. An ideal candidate will experience writing unit tests, end-to-end tests, and testing their own work.</li><li>We are a distributed, fully remote team. There are no core hours. Our culture is passion. If you need someone to keep you focused, we are not the team for you. If you get work done without asking, can make suggestions that can improve a product, love taking ownership in your work, and are looking for a team with extremely capable engineers who all feel the same then PatientPal is for you.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>The ideal candidate should:</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Be passionate about their work above all else. It's okay to mess up, but it's important to own it, grow, and be better for the future.</li><li>Be able to work across all aspects of the application, from database indexes, backend code, testing, frontend, deployment, mobile. If it needs to be done, then you should be capable of figuring it out.</li><li>Be capable of learning new things. The technology we use, the APIs we need to work with, most of the team may not have worked with these things. We don't expect anyone to come in with existing knowledge of everything, so we expect every team member to be capable and interested in learning, solving problems, and be capable of creating something wonderful.</li><li>Be capable of self-directed work. Find a problem, fix it. The team has priorities, you should know what they are and work to help get it done. You should never have to ask if it's worth fixing something or what's the next ticket you should grab is. If it's not obvious to you, then you're out of sync with the team.</li><li>Not be afraid to refactor. Sometimes code is shit and you just need to do it. We're working with a lot of crappy, legacy technologies. We all want to make it better, we're not going to wait around for someone else to do it.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>We are looking to build something incredible. To do so, we expect our team members are here because they want to help us do so.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span><b>Our interview process is this:</b></span></div><div><br></div><ol><li>Interview call, see if our passion aligns (about 20 minutes).</li><li>Technical call, see if you possess the skills to drive change (about 30 minutes).</li><li>Paid work day! We'll pay you for a full day of work, you'll get info to access our repo in advance and will be expected to sign an NDA. We'll pay you $200 for the day, flat. If you pass, we'll send you a job offer. During this day, we'll expect you to be online, working through an actual ticket, ideally making PRs. We're an async team, but we'll have people online working with you regardless of your personal timezone. At the end of the day you'll do a call to go over how the day went and what you got done.</li></ol><div><br></div><div><span><b>Perks of PatientPal:</b></span></div><div><span><br></span></div><ol><li>Work that you can feel good about.<br></li><li>No commutes!<br></li><li>Dress code freedom!<br></li><li>Vacation, holidays, and time off.<br></li><li>Flexible hours<br></li><li>Lots more to come!</li></ol>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Send your info and a resume to <a href='mailto:resumes@patientpal.health' rel='nofollow'>resumes@patientpal.health</a>We're looking for direct hires, we're not interested in consulting groups.</p>  </div>"

<div><p><strong>The No-Bullshit-iest Way We Can Describe This Job In The Least Amount Of Words In A Run-On Sentence: </strong></p><p>We build a lot of different kinds of stuff for a lot of different kinds of folks (<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/work/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/work/</a>) at a shop that is big enough to bite off important, meaningful work and small enough to have fun doing it and we’re looking for an engineer who is equally at ease talking to clients, designers, producers, and developers about things like scope, resource allocation, solutions to engineering problems, creative ideas for how to build things, ways to articulate technical complexity to normal business humans...and occasionally...cut some code.</p><p><strong>Here’s What We Think You Probably Need to Be Successful At This Job: </strong></p><ul><li>Have agency experience, leading a development team spread across multiple projects and clients.</li><li>Hands on developer and leader</li><li>Are comfortable reviewing project specifications, collaborating with company leadership to develop project estimates and technical specs</li><li>Experienced in code reviews to adhere to best practices and internal standards, providing feedback and following up on remediation</li><li>You have an ear to the ground for new tech, whether it comes from hacker news or a programming subreddit, and a desire to dive in and try it out.</li><li>Experience in architecting and building bespoke custom WordPress themes using Advanced Custom Fields, Gravity Forms, Yoast with custom integrations to third party systems.</li><li>Experience in client and server-side debugging, performance profiling and optimization techniques with an uncanny intuition for finding the cause and solution</li><li>Experience with integration of analytics, a/b testing, and advertising platforms using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Planning out projects in coordination with Project Manager/Producer and Developer team members, participating in project check-ins providing feedback to the team</li><li>Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals</li><li>Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA</li><li>Comfortable working with small projects (1 dev) and medium projects (2-3 devs)</li><li>Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation</li><li>Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI</li><li>Comfortable in architecting and implementation of APIs in PHP/Laravel, NodeJS/Express and other similar stacks.</li><li>Attention to detail and a seamless user experience. &nbsp;This means making the product look like the design and working with your team to make it smooth and perfect.</li><li>You have real-world experience with React. &nbsp;AngularJS knowledge might be transferable, but React is what we're looking for.</li><li>jQuery is &quot;nice to have&quot; but NOT necessary in your arsenal. &nbsp;You respect the finer points of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear. We do our work with respect, and we value truth, transparency, and honesty above all else.</li></ul><p>To Apply:&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested, please apply with a resume and introduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Please feel free to skip the formality of a cover letter and write to&nbsp;me as a human being.&nbsp; If you need to use a four letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I’ll take that over what you would think I typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are and what you want in life. Just tell me.</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/192578?reset=False&amp;ra=12AfxD422agE&amp;oqs=a%3D12AfxD422agE' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Sanborn</h2>            <div><p>We're a 25-person interactive shop working with all manner of organizations (sports teams, beauty brands, magazines, non-profits, pharmaceutical companies, startups) helping to create and manage the full battery of digital media goodness (web, mobile, content, video and experiential activations to be specific).</p><p>We believe passionate, talented people all working together smoothly yields awesome work that lets us come back and do it again tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Some more about where we stand as a company:&nbsp;<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/about</a></p><p><strong>About Our Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>The team is made of folks who seem to enjoy bouncing in and out of different projects of different sizes with varying engineering challenges associated with them.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Our designers are highly technical and our engineers are very invested in the visual fidelity of their work - so some of the lines that typically divide UI/UX and engineering cultures don't really exist here.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>At any one given time we'll have folks on longer term missions (ie - 6 to 8 month long-term projects where we're in more of a product development posture) and people on shorter term campaign-based work where we're trying to explode a firecracker in the sky, measure how far and bright it travels, and then move onto to the next one.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>We try to keep plates of work varied and diversified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Everyone is a grownup.&nbsp;</li></ul>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work friendly environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full health benefits package.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Los Angeles office locations.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shithead eco-flush system ensuring shitheadless working environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Family owned and operated.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Full stack developers are also very welcome to apply.</p><p>Our stack currently includes Angular, React, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Mongo and redis.</p><p>Some reasons you’d enjoy working with us:</p><p>- Around 80% of our codebase is open-source and we’re big fans of Free Software.</p><p>- Working hours can be flexible to your needs. Our core hours are 2pm--5pm UK time. Applicants in the US and EU are preferred.</p><p>- We’re agile (with a lowercase a). We test thoroughly (unit and acceptance), we have a CI build process, a full staging environment to play with, and we automate as much as possible.</p><p>- Remote is a first class citizen, all founders and employees work remotely. We get everyone together in London every few months for valuable face to face time.</p><p>Please see <a href='https://overleaf.workable.com/jobs/734449' rel='nofollow'>https://overleaf.workable.com/jobs/734449</a> for more information and how to apply.<span>              </span></p><div>        <p>                      <u></u>                        </p></div></span></div>"

The experiences they publish work consistently across all browsers and devices, and all customer engagement is tracked with extensive analytics. All without writing code.</span></p><p><strong>About the Product</strong></p><p><span>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</span></p><p><span>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</span></p><p><span>We’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Chef, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</span></p><p><strong>About the Team</strong></p><p><span>As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.</span></p><p><span>We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it’s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO’s atrocious spelling.</span></p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p><span>Working completely from home, you’ll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing. We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15” Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</span></p><p><span>We believe that every piece of content created within Ceros is an experience. As such, we strive for the user’s experience to be as smooth as possible. To achieve this, we need developers with a passion for web performance. We’re looking for people with experience profiling javascript applications and squeezing every last millisecond out of the code. We want somebody that is knowledgeable in web performance best practices and strives to make code faster.</span></p><p><span>Desired experience:</span></p><ul><li><span>Object-oriented programming</span></li><li><span>Image &amp; video asset optimization (Webp, Adaptive bitrate streaming, etc.)</span></li><li><span>Asset preloading </span></li><li><span>Efficient use of caches</span></li><li><span>Building performant web animations</span></li><li><span>HTTP/2 protocol to streamline loading</span></li><li><span>Impress us with anything else you have experience with!</span></li></ul><p><span>As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves:</span></p><ul><li><span>writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying),</span></li><li><span>having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,</span></li><li><span>carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,</span></li><li><span>agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,</span></li><li><span>collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,</span></li><li><span>and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p><span>If you’re interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us. We’re a company of passionate, honest, and sometimes silly people, so don’t be afraid to express yourself.</span></p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/186544?reset=False&amp;ra=10yMLam10e64&amp;oqs=a%3D10yMLam10e64' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Ceros</h2>            <div><p>With flexible hours, a generous vacation policy and the best darn coworkers you could ask for, we don't need to resort to bribing new hires with candy from our creepy white van.</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Vacation Policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Enjoy Your Work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Top-notch Gear</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work 100% From Home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team meet-ups 3x/year</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

We have over two million registered users from around the world. Our primary product is an online, real time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Who We Are</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf was founded by two mathematicians who were inspired by their own experiences in academia to create a better solution for scientific collaboration and communication. Now we are a team of thirty with about a dozen developers, based mainly in and around the UK and in the US.</div><div><br></div><div>About half of our development team joined us through our acquisition of ShareLaTeX, another major online LaTeX editor, last summer, and we've now integrated the two teams.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Our Tech</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf is based on open source software, and following our integration with ShareLaTeX, around 80% of our product code is itself open source. You can find it on GitHub:&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsharelatex%2Fsharelatex' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex</a></div><div><br></div><div>We currently have two overlapping tech stacks, one from Overleaf and one from ShareLaTeX. We are working on merging them together into &quot;Overleaf v2&quot;, which is now in public beta ( https://www.overleaf.com/help/342 ) and will launch in time for the fall academic term in September 2018.</div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf v1 has a Ruby on Rails backend using PostgreSQL and redis, hosted mainly on Heroku. We also have several node.js services that we've extracted from our rails monolith. On the frontend, recent development has been with React in ES6, bundled with webpack.</div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf v2 and ShareLaTeX run on a node.js backend using MongoDB and redis, hosted mainly on Linode and managed with Chef. Here we use a microservice architecture, with about a dozen services. Mainly our code is written in CoffeeScript, but new code is being written in ES6 where possible. On the frontend, we mainly use Angular v1, with some newer components being written with React.</div><div><br></div><div>We use Docker to manage our development environments, and our devops team is currently working on moving our production infrastructure to Kubernetes. We support continuous delivery and typically deploy at least a few times a day (less on Fridays).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How We Work</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf is remote-first — all founders and staff work remotely. We also have an office by King's Cross station for those in the London area, and we get the whole team together in London several times a year for face-to-face time.</div><div><br></div><div>We encourage flexible working. Our core hours are 2pm–5pm UK time, during which we have a 10–15 minute daily standup call for the whole development team. We have few standing meetings for developers, but we do many smaller video or voice calls for pairing or within project groups.</div><div><br></div><div>We don't yet have standing teams, but we form and dissolve smaller teams on a per-project basis; we try to give everyone the opportunity to serve as a team lead if they want to.</div><div><br></div><div>We always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run many surveys and user interviews.</div><div><br></div><div>We organize our work with Kanban. We use GitHub pull requests for each feature with code review to share knowledge and best practices (and catch bugs). We test thoroughly with automated unit and acceptance tests, supported by continuous integration (CI). We're also fans of linting to minimise bike-shedding (and to catch bugs).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>About This Role</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We plan to add up to three developers to our team, two with a backend focus and one with a frontend focus. Full stack developers are also very welcome to apply.</div><div><br></div><div>This year, you will work mainly on our integration projects — building out Overleaf v2. Here are some examples of projects (large and small) we've recently completed, to give you an idea of what you might work on:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F644-two-quick-updates-to-overleaf-v2-based-on-your-feedback' rel='nofollow'>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/644-two-quick-update...</a></li><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharelatex.com%2Fblog%2F2017%2F11%2F27%2Fintegration-update-link-sharing.html' rel='nofollow'>https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2017/11/27/integra...</a></li><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F523-a-data-driven-approach-to-latex-autocomplete' rel='nofollow'>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/523-a-data-driven-ap...</a></li></ul><div><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F523-a-data-driven-approach-to-latex-autocomplete' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><br></div><div>Post-integration, we are planning projects around improved collaboration features for teams, improvements to our rich text mode, and more.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How We Hire</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The stages in our hiring process are typically:</div><div><br></div><ol><li>We will aim to update you on the status of your application within one week from when we receive it.</li><li>We'll schedule a short video or voice call to discuss your application. This is a non-technical screening call, up to 30 minutes long, in which we get to know each other and assess whether there may be a good fit. In particular, we'll discuss logistics and your ambitions and expectations, and we may ask for clarifications on your application. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions.</li><li>We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically two hours long. The first hour is discussion, and the second hour is technical. For the technical, you'll have the option of either completing a homework assignment, which requires about one hour of your time before the interview, or solving a problem in the interview, if you prefer. The problems are practical in nature (no fizz-buzz or reversing linked lists), and you can use Google, man pages, etc., and ask us questions.</li><li>We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.</li></ol><div>If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Requirements</span><br></b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>We require that you:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>have a minimum of 2–3 years of relevant experience (we aren't taking on more new graduates at the moment).<br></li><li>will work for us full time (or nearly full time).<br></li><li>will usually be available in our core hours, 2pm–5pm UK time.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Experience with the technologies we use is always a bonus, but you don't need to know them all; your ability to learn is much more important to us.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Benefits</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Remote and flexible working.<br></li><li>Salary £40k<span>–</span>£75k per year depending on experience.<br></li><li>You would join a small, dedicated and growing team.<br></li><li>We're substantially (around 80%) open source, so your work will often be on open source code.<br></li><li>We're backed by Bethnal Green Ventures ( https://bethnalgreenventures.com/ ) and Digital Science ( https://www.digital-science.com/ ), through which we're part of a wider community of startups in science, health and ed-tech.<br></li><li>Our London office is shared with several other Digital Science companies, so there's lots of interesting people to meet, and clubs and sports activities outside of work.<br></li><li>You can pick your own equipment. MacBook Pro? Lenovo ThinkPad? Notebook and pen? However you like to work, we'll provide what you need.<br></li><li>We provide a training budget; many of our developers choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.<br></li><li>We run a biweekly internal seminar series (show and tell) with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</div>  </div>  <div>    <h4>Apply for this position</h4>    <p>Please send us a resume and covering letter via <a href='https://overleaf.workable.com/jobs/734449/candidates/new' rel='nofollow'>https://overleaf.workable.com/jobs/734449/candidates/new</a> . </p>  </div>"

Patients on our service receive presorted medication trays filled by a pharmacy that insert into a smart pillbox that can sense when patients forget a dose and sends an automated text, phone, email, or on-box reminder to patients and their caregivers. Our health coaches will follow up and call patients who are continually nonadherent. We also provide software for caregivers so that they have peace of mind that their loved ones are taking their medication properly. In a clinical study run by Penn Medicine and Independence Blue Cross, we increased medication adherence from 70% to 99%. </p><p>We currently sell to health insurance companies and hospital systems so that patients receive it for free. Our patients love us because we take away the complexity of managing medications and our customers love us because we keep patients healthy and out of the hospital--only 33% of patients take their medication as prescribed and 125,000 people die each year because of medication related errors. We are currently working with the largest health insurance companies in the country and are poised to scale to over 25,000 patients in the next 2 years. We’re on a mission to help patients and revolutionize the way that medications are taken in home. </p><p>To apply, please include a short description of your background and what you're looking for.
