We are mostly based in the UK and so the ability to co-ordinate with this timezone is needed.</strong></p><p><strong>About Dotscience</strong></p><p>Dotscience is a startup founded in 2017 and funded by DDN, the world’s largest privately-held storage company. Its mission is to build an end-to-end data science platform that holds AI accountable for its decision making.</p><p>We like to see ourselves as a very friendly and high-trust team. Because we are fully remote we are able to be flexible about parenting responsibilities and other things in life that need your attention. We co-ordinate once a day in a standup where we check in to say how things are going and tell jokes (it is part of our standup routine). The rest of the time we collaborate through GitHub, Slack, Google Hangouts and Google Docs.&nbsp;<strong>We get together in person every 6-8 weeks for a couple of days somewhere in the UK, where we socialise and build our relationships.&nbsp;</strong>We do get some work done too, but it’s mainly about face time. We try to do something fun and we mix up the venues and locations. Sometimes it’s in a WeWork, but sometimes we hire a holiday cottage and have jam sessions! We see our fair share of babies at our meetings, either in person for a visit and a cuddle, or on our video calls.</p><p>The culture in the Engineering team is very collaborative and within the company all discussions are open by default. Everyone is listened to and nobody gets a special pass to push decisions through. You would be a fit for us if you care about how and why things work, engineering quality and user value. We would be a fit for you if you want a supportive, flexible, high-trust work environment where you are encouraged to grow your role at a pace to suit you.</p><p><strong>About the role</strong></p><p>NOTE: We are looking for a number of engineers across the stack, so we’re flexible about exactly which roles we hire into regarding frontend, backend and full stack.</p><p><strong>Tech We Use</strong></p><p><strong>Front-end</strong></p><ul><li>Javascript</li><li>React</li><li>Redux</li><li>CSS</li><li>SCSS</li></ul><p><strong>Back-end</strong></p><ul><li>Go (core)</li><li>Python (knowledge of)</li><li>PostgreSQL</li><li>Javascript</li><li>Node.js</li></ul><p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p><ul><li>Docker / Kubernetes</li><li>AWS / GCE</li><li>Gitlab / Github</li></ul><p>Aims</p><p><strong>Work with the team to:</strong></p><ul><li>Develop a product which is robust and scalable for cloud and on-premise use</li><li>Design and create services and system architecture</li><li>Ensure the product is built to deliver a good user experience</li></ul><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Design and build our data science platform collaboratively with the team</li><li>Using tech from the list above</li><li>Collaborate through pair programming, attending meetings and being an active member in the self-organising team.</li><li>Help improve our code quality through writing unit tests, automation and performing code reviews</li><li>Participate in brainstorming sessions and contribute ideas to our technology, algorithms and products</li><li>Work with the product and design teams to understand end-user requirements, formulate use cases, and then translate that into a pragmatic and effective technical solution</li><li>Work within the scrum framework to deliver product value to a regular cadence.</li><li>Provide support as part of a rota.</li><li>Write user documentation for the work you do.</li></ul><p><strong>REQUIREMENTS</strong></p><p><strong>Experience</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Degree-level education (or comparable experience) in STEM or another relevant area.</strong></li><li>Good understanding and plenty of practical experience in a statically typed programming language.

The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale.

Help us create a true cloud-native website framework with seamless, intuitive transitions between local and cloud environments — and change the future of the web.</p><p><strong>About Us</strong><br>Gatsby is a remote-first, community-focused team working to build a high-performance, fun to use, astonishingly flexible presentation layer for any data source. Our core values include transparency (we work in public most of the time); creating a safe, high-trust team; building incredible developer experiences; maintaining a healthy working environment; and helping deliver web experiences that feel amazing to use on every device and connection type.</p><p><strong>Details of the Role<br>Type of Work: </strong>Full-time employee<br><strong>Location: Remote (US or International). Preference for UTC-8 to UTC+4.</strong></p><p><strong>Your Opportunity</strong><br>As a core member of our growing team, you will work closely with the rest of our engineering and product teams to turn ideas into tangible products. Your strong systems and API design skills, operations experience, and ability to deliver projects with multiple stakeholders will move the Gatsby platform forward.</p><p><strong>Why we’re hiring</strong><br>Gatsby is growing fast, and we want to build products that make our user’s projects easier to manage, scale, and improve. The Cloud Team is small with a million interesting problems to solve.</p><p><strong>The team’s mission is to extend Gatsby into the cloud — create everything that Gatsby will or could need in the cloud. This includes:</strong></p><ul><li>Creating a supercharged, specialized compiler in the cloud. Features like incremental and parallel builds, GraphQL backends and image processing as a service will help establish</li><li>Enhance individual developer productivity by enhancing their workflow. From generating a new version of a Gatsby site every time a developer saves a file, to visual diffing between versions of Gatsby sites.</li><li>Enable team collaboration on Gatsby projects, especially including non-technical team members. Building on the Gatsby Preview product, and upcoming CI functionality create features like commenting on live previews, CI reports &amp; dashboards visualizing performance, accessibility, and link checking on a per-commit basis.</li></ul><p>Each of these goals — each of these features — need extensive backend work and creative, thoughtful user-focused front-end development. This is far above and beyond what our users are expecting — but exactly what they need.</p><p>The goal is to create a seamless, intuitive transition between local and cloud environments, between individual workflows on their own machine and hosted compute jobs in the cloud.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with product and design, and working alongside and helping mentor team members, in order to realize this vision.</p><p><strong>Some day-to-day responsibilities:</strong></p><ul><li>Create product APIs. As the team builds feature by feature, your role will be to design and build the APIs and services. We use GraphQL and Node.js as our primary platform.</li><li>Provision and manage cloud infrastructure. You will provision and manage our infrastructure, implement internal access control, auditing etc. We run on Google Cloud and Google Kubernetes Engine, with Terraform, Postgres, etc.</li><li>Service infrastructure and operations. You will help define the patterns and ways in which Gatsby adopts microservices and a service-oriented architecture company-wide. You will help build out company-wide initiatives like service meshes, request tracing, and improved observability.</li><li>Mentorship &amp; team development. As an experienced member of the team you’ll coach and guide less experienced members of the team, contribute to the code review process, and help set and maintain a culture of quality throughout the development process.</li></ul><p><strong>Experience you should have:</strong></p><ul><li>Expertise in JavaScript (ES2015+) and/or TypeScript. The Gatsby Cloud team is a JavaScript team with multiple Node.js backend applications and a React frontend, so strong familiarity with the language is important.</li><li>Experience building and shipping production code in a team setting. Deep-seated drive for writing high-quality code.</li><li>Experience building APIs for other software engineers. We primarily use GraphQL, but welcome applications with strong general API design skills.</li><li>Working knowledge of a database system. Could probably diagram Postgres’s architecture with a bit of thought (don’t worry, that’s not an interview question!).</li><li>Battle scars running internet-facing, production systems. Operational knowledge of Linux, HTTP, and the ability to troubleshoot problems anywhere across the stack.</li></ul><p><strong>Experience it would be nice if you had, but isn’t required:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ve used GraphQL before. You may have experimented a bit with GraphQL on a personal toy project. We use GraphQL heavily at Gatsby and Gatsby Cloud, so it’s a plus to have some level of familiarity.</li><li>Familiarity with Kubernetes. You may not deeply understand Kubernetes, but you may have used kubectl before to check out logs or restart a pod.</li></ul><p><strong>The best parts of this job:</strong></p><ul><li>You’ll be at the cutting edge of website development — working on one of the fastest-growing site-building frameworks on the market.</li><li>You’re on the cutting edge of platform engineering. You’ll acquire and gain a deep understanding of working with Kubernetes, Istio, and Elastic Cloud.</li><li>An incredible team to learn from and mentor. From domain experts to incredibly talented early-career developers, the Gatsby Cloud Team is a team that you will be challenged by and that you will challenge. It’s a team that will reward your hard work by shipping incredible features more quickly than you thought possible. A team that wants you to thrive here and can’t wait to see what you can do.</li><li>Challenging technical problems. Scaling, container orchestration, running untrusted code at scale. These challenging engineering endeavors and problems are complex, but rewarding and oh so fun.</li></ul><p><strong>The worst parts of this job:</strong></p><ul><li>Shifting context. You may necessarily have to shift context and dive into a different feature before the current one is done. It may even be in an area of the code base you’re unfamiliar with or don’t have a ton of understanding about.</li><li>We move quickly, but don’t sacrifice quality. We ship. Early, often, and quickly. You may not be initially comfortable with the cadence we ship features and improvements to end users.</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits we offer:</strong></p><ul><li>3 months of paid parental leave covering both adoption and foster placement</li><li>Unlimited vacation policy, with a minimum of 15 days paid vacation time</li><li>Amazing health, dental, and vision insurance for you and your family (US only)</li><li>Skip the commute with remote work</li><li>Fly to cool locations 3x/year for company-wide meetups</li><li>Stock options in a fast-growing startup</li><li>Gatsby Sabbatical: 4 weeks paid vacation after 4 years tenure</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.com/careers/software-engineer-cloud-team/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Unlike other object storage products, it has strong consistency guarantees, it uses a Unix-like file system hierarchy for organizing objects, it supports containerized compute jobs on the storage nodes, and it supports multiple object links. Manta is run both as a public and private cloud service and on premises in many data centers. Architecturally, it is a large-scale distributed system composed of multiple microservices implemented in node.js and C with metadata state stored in PostgreSQL clusters. Additionally, we are exploring emerging languages and platforms for new development; e.g., Rust.</p><p>Candidates</p><p>We are looking for more people like us: systems generalists who love to cut code—software engineers who are afraid of neither the biggest of problems nor the grittiest details, who are comfortable in every stage of the software design and implementation process, and who find gratification in seeing their work available as open source. We're seeking engineers who are able to move up and down the stack. At any given time, we may find ourselves debugging a nasty device firmware bug, rewriting a portion of the operating system kernel, instrumenting the networking stack, debugging a virtual machine or interpreter, or developing code for a distributed system to allow containers to be understood or managed, perhaps all in the same day or as part of the same problem. We expect you to have detailed knowledge of a favorite language, tool or system, but that you are also able to quickly pick up new ones as needed. And while implementation experience is essential, enthusiasm and interest can trump experience. We are willing to take a chance on someone who wants to step up.</p>",

Magic is a simple idea with endless potential - one phone number that you can send a text message to 24/7 and get anything you want, whenever you want it. Food, flowers, plane tickets, reservations, electronics, you name it. We fulfill these requests magically for our users by being a common interface to a growing network of national and international service providers. Most of our users use us on a regular basis to make their lives easier and to be more productive, but of course, we fulfill our share of crazy requests: meeting celebrities, skywriting, 1,000 gallons of seawater, helicopters, motorcycles...</p><p>But all of this is just the beginning. Magic is a command line interface to the world; it is an API for everything. You can’t &quot;sudo cancel my Comcast subscription&quot; but you can &quot;magic cancel my Comcast subscription.&quot; It’s a unified plaintext interface that sits as a layer of abstraction over the set of all possible products, services, and actions. It’s the Star Trek computer. It’s your companion and your friend.</p><p>Magic was founded in 2015 by a team of software engineers with one simple premise: create a natural language interface to the complexity of the world, delivered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. We are hardcore developers at heart, we are highly iterative, and we are relentless. We are minimal and focused on writing code that really matters.</p><p>ABOUT THE POSITION:</p><p>Our primary technologies right now are Node.js, Meteor, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, Ansible. Experience with these are very nice but not required. We believe in using the right tool for the job.</p><p>We are currently hiring for experienced senior and mid-level engineering positions. This is a full-stack, generalist role for which you will be given a high degree of autonomy and will be expected to deploy impactful code to production in your first week. We're less concerned with your resume and more concerned with your ability to get real stuff done.</p><p>ABOUT WORKING REMOTE:</p><p>This position is full remote and you can live wherever you want, or travel while you work with us. As our team is distributed across several time zones, compatibility with both UTC-7/8 and UTC+8 is helpful and willingness to participate in team meetings at non-standard times for 5-10 hours per week is ideal.</p><p>Come build the future of human-computer interaction with us.</p><p>Bonus points if you've got...</p><p>- Experience working with Node.js, Meteor, modern web application frameworks- Experience with devops, the AWS suite, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins- Experience within early-stage startups, remote, or human operations companies</p><p>Apply here: <a href='https://getmagic.com/engineering/apply/hnr' rel='nofollow'>https://getmagic.com/engineering/apply/hnr</a></p>",

At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale. This leads to high operational costs, lost revenue, and unnecessarily high greenhouse gas emissions</p><p>Portchain is a 2 year old Danish container shipping startup devoted to help container carriers and terminals reduce operational complexity and optimize planning. We apply cutting-edge AI leading to both a better bottom line and less greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>We are an international team of 15 people serving a global customer base and several of the largest companies in the industry.

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.\\n\\nPeople who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.\\n\\nBalena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.\\n\\n* You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.\\n\\n* You can execute and complete software projects.\\n\\n* You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)\\n\\n* You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.\\n\\n* An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.\\n\\n* You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.\\n\\n* You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkills we’re looking for\\n\\n\\n* You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.\\n\\n* You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.\\n\\n* You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.\\n\\n* Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with\\n\\n* Experience leading a software project\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBonus points for the following\\n\\n\\n* Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement\\n\\n* Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)\\n\\n* A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)\\n\\n* Having worked remotely before\\n\\n* Interest in embedded systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\n\\n* Work with extremely talented, diverse team\\n\\n* Equipment of your choice\\n\\n* Remote-friendly\\n\\n* Flexible working hours\\n\\n* Flexible vacation policy\\n\\n* Annual company gathering in an international location\\n\\n* We send you hardware for side projects!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout working at balena\\n\\nWe come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.\\n\\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.  </div> </div>",

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.</p><p>People who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.</p><p>Balena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.</li><li>You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.</li><li>You can execute and complete software projects.</li><li>You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)</li><li>You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.</li><li>An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.</li><li>You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.</li><li>You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.</li></ul><p><strong>Skills we’re looking for</strong></p><ul><li>You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.</li><li>You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.</li><li>You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.</li><li>Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with</li><li>Experience leading a software project</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for the following</strong></p><ul><li>Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement</li><li>Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)</li><li>A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)</li><li>Having worked remotely before</li><li>Interest in embedded systems</li></ul><p>BENEFITS</p><ul><li>Work with extremely talented, diverse team</li><li>Equipment of your choice</li><li>Remote-friendly</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Flexible vacation policy</li><li>Annual company gathering in an international location</li><li>We send you hardware for side projects!</li></ul><p><strong>About working at balena</strong></p><p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://workable.com/j/299979DA26' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Balena</h4>            <div><p>Balena's mission to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT fleet owners.

We are responsible for low level technologies like cluster filesystems as well as web-based frontends for monitoring and managing clusters, so we need people who are willing to learn and move around between projects and languages. We work entirely with free and open source software in upstream projects, so experience contributing to such development would be valuable, and the software we develop is used in mission critical applications so a focus on testing, test automation and software quality is also important.</p>\n <p><br>Currently, we are working on making migration to the public cloud smoother for users of our technology. This includes work on configuration management, automation, testing and monitoring, and also to work in partnership with SAP, Amazon, Microsoft and many others.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n <p><br><strong>Here is a brief list of technologies and tools we work with:</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>Python, Go, Ruby, Salt, Terraform, &nbsp;Prometheus, Grafana, C, C++, Autotools, Git, Pacemaker, Corosync, Bash, Perl, Ansible, Travis CI, Jenkins, Docker, Swagger, Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, Node.js,md-raid, OCFS2, Netweaver and SAP HANA.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It's a long list! If you know all of them that is amazing. None of us do! But together as a team, we cover all of these things and more. So if you know one or two of these and are interested in learning more, or if you really want to dive deep into one particular piece of technology, our team might be right for you.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n <p><br><strong>What we expect from you:</strong><br><br></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>We expect that you know how to code and love to do it as part of a team developing great solutions for our customers, that means, code reviews, unit testing and other techniques to maintain the high quality of our deliverables will be part of your daily routine.</li>\n  <li>We also expect you to be self-motivated and eager to learn and experiment new things by your own, but also in collaboration with your and other teams, and in the end to get the things done.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>We present our work to gather feedback and learn from the many nice people we have here at SUSE, and we expect you to do the same.</li>\n  <li>We also expect that you have experience with complex solutions that demands architecture discussions and release coordination, inside and outside of our team.</li>\n  <li>As in an international team, you will need to communicate in English and we also expect that you have some experience using Linux operating systems.</li>\n  <li>Last, and most important: We expect you to have fun while providing great solutions for our customers.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><br><strong>What would be nice to have:</strong><br><br></p>\n <p>We work a lot with automation, so experience of CI/CD tools, IaC (like Terraform) and configuration management (Salt, Ansible...) would help us a lot. Also, if you have experience with Agile and Devops methodologies or understand this culture and values, this can make this position right for you.&nbsp;<br>Would be great if you have experience with Cloud Providers like Azure, AWS and GCP and know the challenges to deploy Enterprise solutions there, like SAP, Oracle, or any other mission critical applications. &nbsp;If you know how to do it using a cluster, this is awesome. We work with clusters, so familiarity with high-availability is a big plus.</p>\n <br>Don't worry if you don't have any of these experiences, you can still show us your potential and motivation to learn about them!\n <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n <br>\n <strong>We Offer:</strong>\n <ul>\n  <li>Direct contact with representatives of free and open source software projects worldwide.&nbsp;</li>\n  <li>Regular &quot;Hackweeks&quot; and workshops on the company, department, and team levels.</li>\n  <li>Opportunities to take part in IT and open-source conferences all over the world, both as an attendee or a presenter.</li>\n  <li>Five weeks vacation.

I'm the Founder &amp; CTO of Command E…a lightning-fast, secure way to instantly find anything in the cloud with a simple keyboard shortcut. We're building a desktop app (Electron/React/Redux/SQLite) that syncs cloud data locally to your laptop and provides a Spotlight-like search &amp; command interface on top of your cloud data.</p>\n<p>Command E is basically a CLI for business users, built on top of their cloud data. It's inspired by the &quot;fuzzy finder&quot; search boxes in IDEs (i.e. Command-T plugin in vi, Helm plugin in Emacs, ⌘T in Atom, ⌘P in VSCode, etc.). The app has a lot of polish and a very clean, simple design. We already support many enterprise and consumer cloud services (Salesforce, Google Docs, LinkedIn, Asana, Trello, 15+ more).</p>\n<p>We're a small team of 3 Silicon Valley veterans, well-capitalized by top Silicon Valley VC firms + angel investors. Both co-founders are engineers who worked at a VC firm, Eventbrite, and Digg. Our office is at 2nd and Market in San Francisco.</p>\n<p>We're looking to hire 2 senior/core engineers. You'll be building a top-notch Silicon Valley company with experienced founders going after a massive market: search. Electron experience (or desire) is a big plus, but we're open to other backgrounds too. My co-founder and I met ~5 years ago through a &quot;Who's Hiring&quot; thread so we're excited to see who responds to this one - please email me at ben@getcommande.com if you’re interested.</p>",

Our systems are critical to software engineers all over the world and used in every industry; from the public registry, which serves packages to open source engineers and small organizations, to our new enterprise solution, which provides single tenant registries for medium and large customers.</p>\n <p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>\n <p>You are a capable engineer with a passion for working on products and a strong desire to grow. As a member on one of our cross-functional delivery teams you will work in a creative environment tackling complex problems. Our work has far-reaching impact and you will play an important role in the feature delivery by solving technical challenges driving the implementation.</p>\n <p><strong>Here’s the impact you’ll make and what we’ll accomplish together:</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Support a modern software practice</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Follow processes, align work with guidance and goals, and work with other team members to deliver</li>\n  <li>Improve the frequency and quality of iterations over time through process, tooling, and providing feedback</li>\n  <li>Ensure work follows our evolving standards, guidelines and recommendations</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Support the product strategy</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Build features and experiences that reduce effort for our customers and generate tangible value</li>\n  <li>Assist in improvements to our technology stack in ways that will positively impact our customers and community</li>\n  <li>Maintain and evolve the codebase and systems in support of the portfolio’s roadmap</li>\n </ul>\n <p>If these are elements you are excited about and are interested in joining one of npm’s cross-functional teams dedicated to the mission of improving our products, this is the ideal role for you.</p>\n <p><strong>Qualifications</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience with JavaScript and/or Node.js</li>\n  <li>Knowledge of HTTP and experience with HTTP APIs</li>\n  <li>Knowledge of RDBMSs and SQL</li>\n  <li>Familiarity with one or more modern component based web UI libraries</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Great to Have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience shipping software in one or more cloud providers</li>\n  <li>Success building services in a microservice or SOA architecture</li>\n  <li>Experience with Docker and/or Kubernetes</li>\n  <li>Knowledge of one or more major CDN services</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Our Code of Conduct</strong></p>\n <p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior.</p>\n <p><strong>Why You Should Join</strong></p>\n <p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p>\n <p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p>\n <p><strong>Where We Can Hire</strong></p>\n <p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. <strong>We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico. </strong>We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/a1d7e38b-b259-4789-b880-5690fd002bb9' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

Our systems are critical to software engineers all over the world and used in every industry; from the public registry, which serves packages to open source engineers and small organizations, to our new enterprise solution, which provides single tenant registries for medium and large customers.</p>\n<p>What You’ll Do</p>\n<p>You are an experienced engineer with a passion for working on products and mentoring other engineers in technical areas. As a member on one of our cross-functional delivery teams you will work in a creative environment tackling complex problems. Our work has far-reaching impact and you will play a critical role by driving the feature delivery, solving technical challenges, and mentoring other engineers on your team.</p>\n<p>Here’s the impact you’ll make and what we’ll accomplish together:</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Support a modern software practice</strong>\n<p>* Follow processes, ensure tasks are aligned with goals, and work with team members to deliver</p>\n<p>* Improve the frequency and quality of iterations over time through process, tooling, and providing feedback</p>\n<p>* Ensure work follows our evolving standards, guidelines and recommendations</p>\n<p>* Provide mentoring and guidance for other team members in areas of expertise</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Support the product strategy</strong>\n<p>* Build features and experiences that reduce effort for our customers and generate tangible value</p>\n<p>* Identify opportunities to improve our technology stack in ways that will positively impact our customers and community</p>\n<p>* Maintain and evolve the codebase and systems in support of the portfolio’s roadmap</p>\n<p>If these are elements you are excited about and are interested in joining one of npm’s cross-functional teams dedicated to the mission of improving our products, this is the ideal role for you.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Qualifications</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Demonstrated ability and desire to mentor, teach, and lead others</li>\n<li>Experience delivering production services and/or public web sites with JavaScript and&nbsp;</li>\n<a href='http://node.js/' rel='nofollow'>js</a>\n<li>Familiarity with HTTP and experience building well-designed HTTP APIs</li>\n<li>Familiarity with one or more modern component based web UI libraries</li>\n<li>Success building services in a microservice or SOA architecture</li>\n<li>Knowledge of RDBMSs and SQL</li>\n<li>Experience shipping software in one or more cloud providers</li>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Great to Have</strong>\n<ul></ul>\n<li>Familiarity with distributed systems concepts</li>\n<li>Experience with Docker and/or Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Knowledge of one or more major CDN services</li>\n<p>Our Code of Conduct</p>\n<p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct&nbsp;.</p>\n<a href='https://www.npmjs.com/policies/conduct' rel='nofollow'>here</a>\n<p>Why You Should Join</p>\n<p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p>\n<p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p>\n<p>Where We Can Hire</p>\n<p>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico. We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/643a9752-268f-4ae8-975f-9b33213b6313' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>\n</div>",

Your challenge will be to deliver a highly-available service on top of a dynamic collection of third-party data sources whose priority is anything other than making your job easy. Explore the limits of your own resourcefulness by designing human and automated systems that deliver true reliability in an otherwise unpredictable environment. \n  <br> \n  <br>See if you fit our requirements. \n  <br> \n  <br>For this role, we are looking for someone with the following characteristics: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* 2+ years experience building and managing a team of engineers \n  <br> \n  <br>* 5-10 years experience working in back-end applications \n  <br> \n  <br>* 2+ years experience working with front-end applications \n  <br> \n  <br>* Deep familiarity with ES6/NodeJS including deep understanding of promises, async/await \n  <br> \n  <br>* Bonus for familiarity with Chromium/Puppeteer and/or DOM manipulation/selection \n  <br> \n  <br>* Ability to acutely focus on company objectives and mission at hand. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Proven dedication to creating maintainable, functional, and reliable systems. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Ability to pass a background check; have appropriate work authorization \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>To achieve our mission, we always look for high-caliber people who share our core values: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Grit: Resilient problem solvers who finish what they start and love tackling problems of all sizes. We take critical feedback and push through to get the job done. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Collaboration: Egos can be left at home, our focus is on the best outcome, which means regularly challenging each other and being willing to be wrong. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Extreme Ownership: We sign up for big challenges and take extreme ownership to see it through. We make lemonade out of lemons when we have to and don’t let frustration get in the way of getting it done. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Curiosity: We’re passionate learners and get excited to nerd out over non-work related topics at a perhaps unnecessary level of detail. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Honesty: We’re transparent and honest because that’s the right way to treat other people. Integrity is the basis of trust, and trust is everything when you’re creating the future together. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

We provide businesses with global monitoring to both protect against threats and give firms a greater insight into their real customers.</p>\n <p>NS8 engineers collaborate with our team of designers, strategists and engineers to build the industry leading fraud protection suite.</p>\n <p>As an engineer at NS8, most of your time will be spent writing and reviewing code. But you’ll also have an equal voice in the entire lifecycle: Research, design, planning, project management and technology choices.</p>\n <p>This position is Remote. Candidate must be based in the United States. Limited travel for training may be required to either our Las Vegas or Detroit office.</p>\n <p><strong>Technical Requirements</strong></p>\n <p>NS8 engineers have a strong grasp of at least one programming language and are familiar with several others.&nbsp;We have a strong understanding of object-oriented programming and concepts like static typing, data encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.</p>\n <p>NS8 engineers are passionate about high quality code and processes. We understand the value of automated testing, continuous integration and monitoring. We have high standards. We hold ourselves and others to these standards through code reviews and daily interactions.</p>\n <p>We strongly value learning from our peers through collaboration. We also autonomously dive deep to solve complex problems with innovative, simplified solutions.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>At NS8 our engineers are more than developers. Our responsibilities extend beyond the code we write. We take ownership of our entire infrastructure.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/207145?reset=False&amp;ra=17t8IaZf1AQg&amp;oqs=a%3D17t8IaZf1AQg' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a>\n</div>\n<div> \n</div> \n<h4>About NS8</h4> \n<div>\n <p>NS8&nbsp;developers work as a team and decisions are made collaboratively. We encourage people to speak their minds and challenge the status quo. At the same time, no one is above the team.</p>\n <p>We've&nbsp;adopted an agile-like process. We use the Kanban method for managing work within Clubhouse.io. We collaborate, and often pair, using video chat over Zoom and chat using Slack.&nbsp;We have daily stand-ups and weekly retros.</p>\n <p>NS8 developers use the latest tools and have high-end equipment. A high-powered Mac or PC laptop will be provided, along with docking station and multiple monitors.</p>\n <p>Developers on our backend development team work remotely. We have offices based in Las Vegas and Royal Oak Michigan. Limited travel may be required for up to a week of training and an occasional planning or team building event - typically a couple times a year.</p>\n <p>We take time off when necessary and allow flexibility in our working hours. If you have a doctors appointment at 10 AM on a Tuesday, no problem. If your son/daughter has an activity at school, go be with them. You&nbsp;can always make up the time later if necessary.</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Remote development - work from home!</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Highly competitive salaries</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Choose top of the line Mac or PC laptop as your workstation</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Medical, dental and vision benefits</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Stock options available</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Docking stations and multi-monitor setups</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>15 paid holidays in 2018 in addition to vacation and sick time</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>VC funded with plenty of runway</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Headquarters in Vegas!!</span> </li> \n</ul>",

Our systems are critical to software engineers all over the world and used in every industry. Our cross functional feature teams are responsible for the development and maintenance of various segments within our product portfolio. This includes the public registry, which serves packages to open source engineers and small teams, and npm enterprise, a single tenant registry as a service for medium to large organizations.</p>\n <p><strong>What You’ll Do</strong></p>\n <p>You are a strong technical leader with a passion for mentorship and product delivery. In leading this cross-functional team you will work in a creative environment tackling complex problems. Our work has far-reaching impact and you will play a critical role by driving the strategy and evolution of your team’s product portfolio and the growth of individuals in your team.</p>\n <p><strong>Here’s the impact you’ll make and what we’ll accomplish together:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Support a modern software practice\n   <ul>\n    <li>Ensuring adherence to good process, alignment with goals, and cohesion with team members</li>\n    <li>Improving the frequency and quality of iterations over time through process, tooling, and analysis of our systems holistically</li>\n    <li>Participate in development and evolution of standards, guidelines and recommendations</li>\n   </ul></li>\n  <li>Support a diverse team\n   <ul>\n    <li>Made up of product management, design, engineering, and QA in delivering on key outcomes for our products</li>\n    <li>Developing our talent with 1:1 coaching, professional development, goal setting and performance management</li>\n    <li>Reinforcing our commitment to inclusion through improvements to hiring practices and stewardship of team culture</li>\n   </ul></li>\n  <li>Support the product strategy\n   <ul>\n    <li>Building features and experiences that reduce effort for our customers and generate tangible value</li>\n    <li>Identifying opportunities for optimization, and leveraging data to drive continued enhancements</li>\n   </ul></li>\n </ul>\n <p>If these are elements you are excited about and are interested in helping npm guide and lead a cross-functional team dedicated to the mission of improving our products, this is the ideal role for you.</p>\n <p><strong>What You’ll Need To Be Successful</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Experience building / leading teams responsible for development, maintenance, and operation of large scale, distributed, web applications using Node.js and JavaScript</li>\n  <li>Experience leading a highly technical team in building SaaS products and services</li>\n  <li>Strong understanding of complex enterprise technology with the ability to introduce improved experiences and simpler processes</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Great-To-Have</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Customer-facing product experience, including: customer journey mapping, customer research and interviews, customer support</li>\n  <li>Demonstrated experience improving your team’s ability to deliver features at regular intervals that positively impact target metrics</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Our Code of Conduct</strong></p>\n <p>npm exists to facilitate sharing code, by making it easy for JavaScript module developers to publish and distribute packages. npm is a piece of technology, but more importantly, it is a community. We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment. We do not tolerate abusive behavior. See our unabridged code of conduct here.</p>\n <p><strong>Why You Should Join</strong></p>\n <p>In joining the npm team, you’ll become an important part of a small but dedicated engineering team. We strive to provide a sensible working environment that doesn’t ask for or encourage habitual overtime and we offer flexibility in schedule. We have a progressive parental leave policy and vacation time is not just encouraged, but celebrated and enforced. We also understand that healthy schedules lead to better outcomes. To help ensure this balance we have contracted support night coverage so we don’t interrupt anyone’s sleep.</p>\n <p>We believe that high-performing teams include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other’s assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we actively seek a diverse pool of applicants, including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, and people from low-income families.</p>\n <p><strong>Where We Can Hire</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Our headquarters are in Oakland, California. We can best support you if you can overlap with US time zones. We currently have team members across the US time zones and in the UK, Canada, and Mexico.</strong>&nbsp;We cannot currently sponsor new work visas, but we can transfer existing H-1Bs.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/npm/dc2e355d-84c9-46f2-b4fb-de3b47bbe4f3' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

We challenge each other a lot @Scratchpay.</li>\n  </ul>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Our culture</strong></p>\n <p>We care about the human aspect of work and we expect others to. Excellence is also an important keyword @ Scratchpay. While everyone makes mistakes, we learn from them. We are conscious about efficiency and effectiveness in the positive way.

Mediocrity isn't our cup of tea. But we always work hard to help those that are willing to get there!</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>The bad</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Everything goes fast and the ultimate goal is to move the business fast. There can be disconnects in the communication at times. We all need to navigate through this and push whenever it is critical to do so.</li>\n  <li>We are open-minded but things need to be moving forward.</li>\n  <li>We say what we have to. So expect to hear some unpleasant - but true - things sometimes. Don't hesitate to argue back - with respect - if you disagree.</li>\n  <li>Like any startup, It can be a mess some days. You also will likely have to do things that aren't in your scope sometimes. Part of the fun, right? ;)</li>\n </ul>\n <p>The most important is: We are always looking at improving. All the time, step by step. If you feel mediocre and don't see a path to improvement or can't listen to others' voice to, please do not apply.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/scratchpaycom/view/P_AAAAAAEAAJOCKSbYbl0GW1?trackingTag=stackOverflow' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Strong hardware</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Ample holidays</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Stock Options</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>A really cool team</span> </li> \n</ul>",

Generally, consumer frontends are written in React/ES6, and backends in Typescript (Express for REST APIs and native websockets for RTC). We use Redis as a message broker and Postgres as a persistent datastore. Our infrastructure is (mostly) on AWS. \n  <br> \n  <br>The most visually-prominent consumer product is the Koji IDE, a web-based editor that connects to a remote development server and enables full-stack development from any device with a browser. The remote development server uses Docker to create a per-project environment that runs both the editor server (file writes, PTY operations, OT-based real-time collaboration, Git operations, etc.) and the processes/servers required for the user to develop their project (backend servers, frontend dev servers, test runners, etc). \n  <br> \n  <br>At a high level, the web editor’s frontend uses VSCode’s Monaco as a text editor and a custom parser that renders Koji-compliant JSON config files into intuitive visual controls. Because Koji projects are simply modern, standards-compliant Javascript projects (or projects that ultimately target JS), this hybrid approach gives our users the benefits of easy, visual configuration using no-code patterns for manipulating project-level config (strings, colors, styles, mechanics, settings, etc.) without subjecting them to the usual restrictions of no-code/low-code platforms (complex, unintuitive controls; ballooning trees/graphs once projects go beyond simple basics; no ability to drop down and edit native code; etc.). \n  <br> \n  <br>Because Koji projects are staged in the cloud during development, the web editor’s live preview can be opened on any internet-connected device (without the need for ngrok, mobile device proxies, etc.). The editor provides some additional tools for easily testing backend routes and manipulating PTYs. \n  <br> \n  <br>Koji projects are backend by Git repositories. By default, new projects use a Git remote hosted by Koji’s Git server, but projects can also use repositories hosted by third-parties as their remotes. The Koji deploy pipeline uses Git hooks to trigger new builds (build steps are defined by a JSON file within the project) and shows build progress, logs, and notifications inside the web editor. Projects can deploy static bundles or dynamic services that are compiled, containerized, and deployed using Google’s Cloud Run. \n  <br> \n  <br>Once a project is deployed, it can be accessed by an auto-generated subdomain. From within the editor, users can also register a custom subdomain on one of our root domains (e.g., myproject.withkoji.com), or register a custom domain name and configure DNS to point that domain to our CDN. We take care of HTTPS provisioning, deployment, and renewal automatically with Let’s Encrypt, and all projects are accelerated with our CDN partner, Fastly. \n  <br> \n  <br>The CDN that serves deployed projects can also inject plugins at runtime based on path/pattern matching, which lets users easily enable features like Open Graph tags (something that is typically difficult to do on client-side SPAs without SSR or services like Prerender) or integrate things like Google Analytics. The web editor also renders server access logs for deployed projects, giving users an easy way to understand traffic and growth without the need for any third-party analytics/tracking tools. \n </div> \n</div>",
