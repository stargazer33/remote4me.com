We primarily do so through&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/Medi-Share/Medi-Share.aspx' rel='nofollow'>Medi-Share</a>, but as an association of churches, we’re rapidly expanding our “ministry portfolio” and we think technology will be at the center of accomplishing that goal. That’s where you come in. We need help creating and supporting applications (mobile + browser) for the future products and projects we’ve got in the proverbial “hopper.”</p><p>But before we go any further, you need to know if you’ll like working with us. We think you will.</p><p><strong>A bit about us:&nbsp;</strong>You already know the mission of Christian Care Ministry (CCM). We have about 580 employees in various states, but most of them are either at our headquarters in Melbourne, FL, or our Colorado Springs, CO branch. Medi-Share has been growing in every way imaginable since about 2010. It has become commonplace for our CFO to say things like “We’ve grown 30% year over year …again” at seemingly every quarterly employee town hall meeting. We’re extremely humbled and grateful to the Lord for the growth.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is a community of Christians that requires its employees to share its Christian religious beliefs and practices. CCM complies with all anti-discrimination laws applicable to religious employers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the role:</strong>&nbsp;This position serves on the New Product Engineering Team in a Product Team setting. This small, sub-department of our IT team (which is currently under 10 people) is mostly remote. Their main focus has been making some dreams of the leadership team come true (well, at least the dreams that involve amazing code :).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Life as an Employee with CCM’s New Product Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong>We work really hard to make working here an amazing experience. It’s hard to find great talent like you, but if you pick us, we want to keep you for a long time. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Do you prefer mountains or oceans?</strong></p><p>While the majority of the NPE Team is distributed, it is our overwhelming preference that you live near our Colorado Springs, CO office or our headquarters in Melbourne, FL.&nbsp; However, with modern tools, proximity doesn’t influence productivity and if absolutely necessary, we can discuss an exception. For this job in particular, we do need some collaboration though, so just make sure you have a reliable internet connection, of course.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>The New Product Engineering Team is operating in “start up” mode. This means that we work hard and smart to get projects completed in a reasonable timeline. On occasion, there may be instances when extra time is needed (usually around a product launch or a really big release), but those are pretty infrequent. Basically, we commit you to at least 6 hours of coding per day in our Sprints and as long as you get the work done, we’re okay with when you get it done. Just be available when the team may need your help, or when you may need their help. Sometimes life happens in the middle of the day, and we understand that. We also think “more meetings” means less time for coding so we protect your time. We have one morning stand-up at 10am EST where we find out when there could be overlap that day. Oh, one more cool thing about the only meeting you attend – we “eat our own dog food” and close each stand-up praying for Medi-Share members’ needs listed in our mobile app.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it by giving you those extra 2 hours per workday to collaborate or learn. The stack we generally work on is relatively new so taking time to hone in your skills is pretty imperative. We send members to conferences or webinars as we need to. We love seeing our people growing.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer…</strong></p><p>This is the part where we describe the experience necessary to be considered for the position.</p><p>You’re a skilled developer, but maybe you haven’t gotten a chance to prove it yet professionally. We can give you that chance.&nbsp;</p><p>But before you get _too_ excited, let me explain. We only hire great developers, and this position is no exception. When we ask you to write or debug code during our interviews, you’ll do so confidently. You might not be able to show us 5 applications you’ve shipped, but you can point to something recent you’ve spent significant time coding that you’re really proud of, like your university project, your open source contributions, or your project at your last job. If we ask your professors, classmates, or coworkers about you, they’ll have great things to say.</p><p>In short, we won’t teach you how to be a good programmer, since you already are, but we can certainly help you be a better, professionally-experienced programmer.</p><p>Our ideal candidate either has a college degree in computer science, or if not, 2+ years of recent, solid professional programming experience. Our especially ideal candidate has experience with either Node.js or React.js. Having only done that in your free time is fine. That tells us you are curious enough to learn on your own.</p><p>Our stack contains a very healthy JavaScript client utilizing Heroku, Node.js, React.js, and a few others. CCM is in the process of migrating to Salesforce so we often interact with their APIs. For our mobile apps we’re using React Native, because, well, basically, it’s awesome (and we really think our philosophies of “API First” and “Learn Once, Code Everywhere” are going to be the norm in the near future). Our backend API servers use either Ruby on Rails or Node.js/Express, with PostgreSQL and Redis as our data layer. Despite those being our “sweet spots” before we take on a new product, we pick the stack that works best for that solution.</p><p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are curious how things work, you are self-motivated and self-driven.</li><li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li><li>Thrive with directions like:<ul><li>“Here is the mock up for feature X. How do you think we should approach this?”</li><li>&quot;Check out the Jira story and play a bit with library X on GitHub. This might solve our problem Y. Let's discuss the pros and cons tomorrow.&quot; &nbsp;</li><li>&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it and why do you think that's a good idea?&quot;</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li><li>You got a smirk on your face when you saw you could work on the stack listed above, AT A MINISTRY!</li><li>As you’ve read this job description, you realize this team obviously is comprised of people who you’d enjoy spending a work week with. (ended that sentence with a preposition, we're not paid for our grammatical skills)</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p><ul><li>You already are a Medi-Share member or would want to join membership even if you didn’t work here.</li><li>You’ve built stuff using React Native (even if it was for your mom’s bingo club or something crazier).</li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>Super important stuff that sounds like it was written by lawyers:</p><p>This job description in no way states or implies that these are the only duties to be performed by the employee(s) incumbent in this position. Employee(s) will be required to follow any other job-related instructions and to perform any other job-related duties requested by any person authorized to give instructions or assignments. This document does not create an employment contract, implied or otherwise, other than an &quot;at will&quot; relationship.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is committed to&nbsp;serving&nbsp;the Lord and our membership with excellence. As&nbsp;employees&nbsp;we are&nbsp;committed to adhering&nbsp;to the same standard of Biblical principles of lifestyle and health as required for membership in our Medi-Share program which include:</p><ul><li>Have a verifiable Christian testimony indicating a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, and profess the&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/what_we_believe.aspx' rel='nofollow'><strong>Statement of Faith</strong></a></li><li>Attend a fellowship of believers, regularly and actively support that ministry, and live under the discipline of that body</li><li>Share the conviction that believers are to bear one another’s burdens according to Galatians 6:2</li><li>Believe the Biblical doctrine that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;are to be kept pure</li><li>Must not engage in sex outside of traditional Christian marriage</li><li>Cannot use tobacco or illegal drugs in any form, or abuse legal drugs or alcohol</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;How To Apply</strong></p><ul><li>Apply here. In your cover letter, introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.</li><li>Please include links to apps you’ve built or anything else that makes you look good, and describe your role in building those apps. (If they’re internal, you can skip the link part.)</li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for. Plus, you’ll see at our site we ask for a lot of the same info anyway.</li><li>Please complete the following questions, and include them with your cover letter. This shouldn’t take you very long.<ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? Is there another language that you’re curious to learn next?</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>In a 2-3 sentences, what has your life with Jesus looked like over the last 3 weeks? There’s no wrong answer.</li></ul></li></ul><p>There will be a few other things if we get past the first interview, but we’ll cover that later. We even like doing our hiring on an iterative basis.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/christiancareministry/jobs/1215334' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Onsite gym</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>15 days PTO</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>$621/month flex earnings for health coverage</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

We're a Code for America Accelerator company and have an incredible team of seasoned executives and engineers. We work hard but maintain a casual work environment with a strong culture as a tech startup. As a new member of the GovSpend family, you'll work closely with our senior team members to implement critical pieces of our modern, forward-thinking architecture – learning many new technologies as you touch every part of the application’s source code.</p><p><strong>What you’ll do:</strong></p><p>You'll build new features and products in our web app, from the UI components in the browser to the node services and database structure behind them in modern, functional javascript. The area you focus in is largely up to you - some of our developers end up more focused on GUI, others on services, but everyone is good at both. Every line of code goes through a pull request review, so everyone has the opportunity to collaborate on everything that’s going on in the company.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What you'll need:</strong></p><ul><li>Bachelor’s degree in MIS, Computer Science or similar strongly preferred. Proven work experience will be considered in lieu of degree.</li><li>Strong understanding of&nbsp;<strong>functional programming in Javascript</strong>. Currying and composition should be second nature to you. Extensive Lodash or Ramda experience may be sufficient, but you’ll get bonus points for Category Theory.</li><li>Be proficient with&nbsp;<strong>React</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>MobX</strong>&nbsp;(Redux with selectors can work too).</li><li>Have Production experience with&nbsp;<strong>NodeJS</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus:</strong></p><ul><li>Contribute to our open source repos (<strong>github.com/smartprocure</strong>).

We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Get the chance to work with big brands</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Live and work in one of our roaming hacker houses around the world</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from anywhere as part of a community of digital nomads</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Join our vibrant community</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We provide up to $2,500 in funding for your growth &amp; wellbeing</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Gym reimbursement</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Our organization is adaptive, getting feedback signals from our users and systems. Right now we organize ourselves by projects, which allow us to build complex features and solve big problems, while staying mutable. As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

user experience. &nbsp;This means making the product look like the design and working with your team to make it smooth and perfect.</li><li>You have real-world experience with React. &nbsp;AngularJS knowledge might be transferable, but React is what we're looking for.</li><li>jQuery is &quot;nice to have&quot; but NOT necessary in your arsenal. &nbsp;You respect the finer points of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear. We do our work with respect, and we value truth, transparency, and honesty above all else.</li></ul><p>To Apply:&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested, please apply with a resume and introduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Please feel free to skip the formality of a cover letter and write to&nbsp;me as a human being.&nbsp; If you need to use a four letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I’ll take that over what you would think I typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are and what you want in life. Just tell me.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/192578?reset=False&amp;ra=12AfxD422agE&amp;oqs=a%3D12AfxD422agE' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Sanborn</h3>            <div><p>We're a 25-person interactive shop working with all manner of organizations (sports teams, beauty brands, magazines, non-profits, pharmaceutical companies, startups) helping to create and manage the full battery of digital media goodness (web, mobile, content, video and experiential activations to be specific).</p><p>We believe passionate, talented people all working together smoothly yields awesome work that lets us come back and do it again tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Some more about where we stand as a company:&nbsp;<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/about</a></p><p><strong>About Our Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>The team is made of folks who seem to enjoy bouncing in and out of different projects of different sizes with varying engineering challenges associated with them.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Our designers are highly technical and our engineers are very invested in the visual fidelity of their work - so some of the lines that typically divide UI/UX and engineering cultures don't really exist here.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>At any one given time we'll have folks on longer term missions (ie - 6 to 8 month long-term projects where we're in more of a product development posture) and people on shorter term campaign-based work where we're trying to explode a firecracker in the sky, measure how far and bright it travels, and then move onto to the next one.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>We try to keep plates of work varied and diversified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Everyone is a grownup.&nbsp;</li></ul>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work friendly environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full health benefits package.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Los Angeles office locations.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shithead eco-flush system ensuring shitheadless working environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Family owned and operated.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.<br>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. Thats a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.<br><br> <br>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, FT, Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Australian Herald to name a few.

You care deeply about building applications with well thought out architecture.<br><br><br> Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node APIs where required.<br><br><br>We are a small team so its important that the successful candidate isnt just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.<br><br><br>Apply if you want to:<br> * Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.<br> * Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.<br> * Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.<br> * Develop robust deployment and testing processes <br> * Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.<br> <br><br><br>Benefits<br><br>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> <br> * Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.<br> * 25 days holiday<br> * Pension Scheme<br> * Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.<br> * We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office. We run a Remote working structure as a team (we currently have team members in London, Bristol and Stoke in the UK and Barcelona, Spain) so time zone variance (and travel distance) has to be sensible. <br> <br><br><br><br>We can't offer visa sponsorship at this time. <p>See more jobs at <span>Roostermoney</span></p></div></div>"

We primarily do so through&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/Medi-Share/Medi-Share.aspx' rel='nofollow'>Medi-Share</a>, but as an association of churches, we’re rapidly expanding our “ministry portfolio” and we think technology will be at the center of accomplishing that goal. That’s where you come in. We need help creating and supporting applications (mobile + browser) for the future products and projects we’ve got in the proverbial “hopper.”</p><p>But before we go any further, you need to know if you’ll like working with us. We think you will.</p><p><strong>A bit about us:&nbsp;</strong>You already know the mission of Christian Care Ministry (CCM). We have about 580 employees in various states, but most of them are either at our headquarters in Melbourne, FL, or our Colorado Springs, CO branch. Medi-Share has been growing in every way imaginable since about 2010. It has become commonplace for our CFO to say things like “We’ve grown 30% year over year …again” at seemingly every quarterly employee town hall meeting. We’re extremely humbled and grateful to the Lord for the growth.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is a community of Christians that requires its employees to share its Christian religious beliefs and practices. CCM complies with all anti-discrimination laws applicable to religious employers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the role:</strong>&nbsp;This position serves on the New Product Engineering Team in a Product Team setting. This small, sub-department of our IT team (which is currently under 10 people) is mostly remote. Their main focus has been making some dreams of the leadership team come true (well, at least the dreams that involve amazing code :).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Life as an Employee with CCM’s New Product Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong>We work really hard to make working here an amazing experience. It’s hard to find great talent like you, but if you pick us, we want to keep you for a long time. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Do you prefer mountains or oceans?</strong></p><p>While the majority of the NPE Team is distributed, it is our overwhelming preference that you live near our Colorado Springs, CO office or our headquarters in Melbourne, FL.&nbsp; However, with modern tools, proximity doesn’t influence productivity and if absolutely necessary, we can discuss an exception. For this job in particular, we do need some collaboration though, so just make sure you have a reliable internet connection, of course.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>The New Product Engineering Team is operating in “start up” mode. This means that we work hard and smart to get projects completed in a reasonable timeline. On occasion, there may be instances when extra time is needed (usually around a product launch or a really big release), but those are pretty infrequent. Basically, we commit you to at least 6 hours of coding per day in our Sprints and as long as you get the work done, we’re okay with when you get it done. Just be available when the team may need your help, or when you may need their help. Sometimes life happens in the middle of the day, and we understand that. We also think “more meetings” means less time for coding so we protect your time. We have one morning stand-up at 10am EST where we find out when there could be overlap that day. Oh, one more cool thing about the only meeting you attend – we “eat our own dog food” and close each stand-up praying for Medi-Share members’ needs listed in our mobile app.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it by giving you those extra 2 hours per workday to collaborate or learn. The stack we generally work on is relatively new so taking time to hone in your skills is pretty imperative. We send members to conferences or webinars as we need to. We love seeing our people growing.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer…</strong></p><p>This is the part where we describe the experience necessary to be considered for the position.</p><p>You’re a skilled developer, but maybe you haven’t gotten a chance to prove it yet professionally. We can give you that chance.&nbsp;</p><p>But before you get _too_ excited, let me explain. We only hire great developers, and this position is no exception. When we ask you to write or debug code during our interviews, you’ll do so confidently. You might not be able to show us 5 applications you’ve shipped, but you can point to something recent you’ve spent significant time coding that you’re really proud of, like your university project, your open source contributions, or your project at your last job. If we ask your professors, classmates, or coworkers about you, they’ll have great things to say.</p><p>In short, we won’t teach you how to be a good programmer, since you already are, but we can certainly help you be a better, professionally-experienced programmer.</p><p>Our ideal candidate either has a college degree in computer science, or if not, 2+ years of recent, solid professional programming experience. Our especially ideal candidate has experience with either Node.js or React.js. Having only done that in your free time is fine. That tells us you are curious enough to learn on your own.</p><p>Our stack contains a very healthy JavaScript client utilizing Heroku, Node.js, React.js, and a few others. CCM is in the process of migrating to Salesforce so we often interact with their APIs. For our mobile apps we’re using React Native, because, well, basically, it’s awesome (and we really think our philosophies of “API First” and “Learn Once, Code Everywhere” are going to be the norm in the near future). Our backend API servers use either Ruby on Rails or Node.js/Express, with PostgreSQL and Redis as our data layer. Despite those being our “sweet spots” before we take on a new product, we pick the stack that works best for that solution.</p><p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are curious how things work, you are self-motivated and self-driven.</li><li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li><li>Thrive with directions like:<ul><li>“Here is the mock up for feature X. How do you think we should approach this?”</li><li>&quot;Check out the Jira story and play a bit with library X on GitHub. This might solve our problem Y. Let's discuss the pros and cons tomorrow.&quot; &nbsp;</li><li>&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it and why do you think that's a good idea?&quot;</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li><li>You got a smirk on your face when you saw you could work on the stack listed above, AT A MINISTRY!</li><li>As you’ve read this job description, you realize this team obviously is comprised of people who you’d enjoy spending a work week with. (ended that sentence with a preposition, we're not paid for our grammatical skills)</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p><ul><li>You already are a Medi-Share member or would want to join membership even if you didn’t work here.</li><li>You’ve built stuff using React Native (even if it was for your mom’s bingo club or something crazier).</li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>Super important stuff that sounds like it was written by lawyers:</p><p>This job description in no way states or implies that these are the only duties to be performed by the employee(s) incumbent in this position. Employee(s) will be required to follow any other job-related instructions and to perform any other job-related duties requested by any person authorized to give instructions or assignments. This document does not create an employment contract, implied or otherwise, other than an &quot;at will&quot; relationship.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is committed to&nbsp;serving&nbsp;the Lord and our membership with excellence. As&nbsp;employees&nbsp;we are&nbsp;committed to adhering&nbsp;to the same standard of Biblical principles of lifestyle and health as required for membership in our Medi-Share program which include:</p><ul><li>Have a verifiable Christian testimony indicating a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, and profess the&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/what_we_believe.aspx' rel='nofollow'><strong>Statement of Faith</strong></a></li><li>Attend a fellowship of believers, regularly and actively support that ministry, and live under the discipline of that body</li><li>Share the conviction that believers are to bear one another’s burdens according to Galatians 6:2</li><li>Believe the Biblical doctrine that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;are to be kept pure</li><li>Must not engage in sex outside of traditional Christian marriage</li><li>Cannot use tobacco or illegal drugs in any form, or abuse legal drugs or alcohol</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;How To Apply</strong></p><ul><li>Apply here. In your cover letter, introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.</li><li>Please include links to apps you’ve built or anything else that makes you look good, and describe your role in building those apps. (If they’re internal, you can skip the link part.)</li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for. Plus, you’ll see at our site we ask for a lot of the same info anyway.</li><li>Please complete the following questions, and include them with your cover letter. This shouldn’t take you very long.<ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? Is there another language that you’re curious to learn next?</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>In a 2-3 sentences, what has your life with Jesus looked like over the last 3 weeks? There’s no wrong answer.</li></ul></li></ul><p>There will be a few other things if we get past the first interview, but we’ll cover that later. We even like doing our hiring on an iterative basis.</p>            </div><div>How to apply:<br><a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/christiancareministry/jobs/1215334' rel='nofollow'>boards.greenhouse.io/christiancareministry/jobs/1215334</a></div>"

For the first time, ever TrndStar users will be able to compete and collaborate with each other. This will give the artist a chance to go head to head with other users and have their respective followers vote, comment, rate, and share. As well as giving them an opportunity to collaborate with an artist that they wouldn't normally be able to work with.</p><p>3. With these unique features, TrndStar will allow users the ability to leverage other users to grow their following and fanbase. This will allow them to gain followers 10 times faster than any other social platform.</p><p>4. Trndstar isn't exclusive to just artists and people wanting to share their talents.

We’re questioning the way things have been done in this industry for over a hundred years with an open mind to how customers want insurance to work—everything from how insurance is quoted &amp; sold, to the back-end operations that frustrate everyone and waste money. Insurance is one of a few remaining greenfield industries, with many interesting engineering problems that need a fresh perspective.</p><p>This isn’t something we’ve undertaken on a whim—we’ve been at this for a year, and planning for several years. We know we can do this because we’re the right mix of contrarian ideas backed by subject-matter expertise. The founding team brings executive-level experience from Liberty Mutual Insurance and Goldman Sachs, with mastery in actuarial science, computer engineering, math, and finance (MIT, Duke, and the University of Michigan). You can read more about the founders <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/ty-harris-73a40816/' rel='nofollow'>here</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-wielbut/' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. &nbsp;The rest of the team--the real strength of the company--are key early hires who are experts in their respective fields of statistics, actuarial science, and engineering. In aggregate, across the company, we’ve essentially built all of this before.&nbsp;</p><p>We were one of the 10 companies selected to Boston Techstars 2018 class. You can watch our <a href='https://vimeo.com/267654520' rel='nofollow'>Demo Day video here</a> to learn more about what we’re building.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a long runway and path to additional funding; we recently closed an oversubscribed round with a mix of amazing VCs and an exclusive group of angels made up of industry experts and executives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What kind of people do we gravitate to?</em></p><p>As a company, we place great value on curiosity, integrity, and ownership, both as character traits in members of the team, but also in the way we approach business and technical challenges. We want people who thrive in environments where they get to wear multiple hats. We’re looking for someone who wants to spend most of their time coding—a polyglot that is comfortable using multiple languages depending on the task at hand (but need not be a wizard/expert in any one language), and an autodidact who is excited to dive into a deep and quantitative subject matter. Insurance or finance knowledge is not required.</p><p><strong>We’re at a critical point in our company.</strong> Following a successful prototype, we’re now building the first production-version of everything. You will play a pivotal role in helping define everything from our engineering culture to the insurance product upon which customers will rely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What are the responsibilities?</em></p><p>We’re hiring for a senior engineer role. Your primary responsibility will be to develop the backend systems that power the pricing and sale of our insurance products. This includes but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>Integrating with a dozen data vendors to provide real-time information on hundreds of data points; everything from property characteristics, such as roof construction material, to weather-related data that help us predict flood risk or potential hailstorm damage.</li><li>Turning statistical models into production-quality code that can make pricing decisions, assessing a customer’s risk.&nbsp;</li><li>Build a smart qualifier that decides if an applicant is eligible to be insured, while also making sure to avoid purchasing expensive data for a lost cause.</li><li>Make important architectural and operational decisions like microservices vs. monoliths, deployment techniques, technologies, policies, etc.</li><li>Build an API to allow third-party resellers to purchase insurance from us programmatically.&nbsp;</li><li>And tons of future projects: machine learning for fraud detection, satellite/aerial imagery processing, IOT integration, etc.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What skills or qualifications would help you stand out?</em></p><ul><li>Computer science, engineering, or math-focused, college degree or equivalent experience</li><li>You’re proficient in Go/Golang, or some other compiled programming language such as Java or C/C++</li><li>You’ve written code that’s been deployed to production and used by 1,000+ strangers&nbsp;</li><li>You are a problem-solver who can balance between short-term and long-term solutions&nbsp;</li><li>You need to have excellent communication skills</li><li>You are technically proficient enough to solve hard problems independently, but you understand that collaborative solutions are usually better. &nbsp;You’re willing to ask for and offer help to your teammates to achieve the best solution</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What’s in our stack?</em></p><p>We’re careful to select technologies that are the right fit for solving the specific problem, not just the new hotness. We also place great importance in things we know really well. It’s often the nuances in a language or technology the make or break you in the long run.</p><p>Backend/Core</p><ul><li>Go</li><li>Postgresql</li></ul><p>Frontend:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>VueJS</li><li>Webpack</li><li>NodeJs/Express</li></ul><p>Research/Data Science</p><ul><li>R</li><li>ArcGIS</li><li>Python</li></ul><p>Infrastructure</p><ul><li>Google Cloud</li><li>Kubernetes</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Everything else:</em></p><p>This is full-time position.</p><p>Compensation is a mix of competitive salary and equity. We offer full benefits (medical, dental, vision) and contribute to your 401K.</p><p>We’re Boston-based, but we have some remote employees i.e. we’re open to any US-based applicants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> Equity + full medical benefits + 401K contribution</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> Send us your resume, GitHub link, or a description of recent projects, and why you'd be a good fit.</p>"

    "content": "*About Fluidly*<br />Fluidly is a seed stage fintech startup that launched to the public in October 2017. We’re building a new category - intelligent business finance.<br /><br />We want to solve the biggest problem facing small businesses - poor cashflow. We use technology to provide real-time cashflow forecasting and automated credit control that helps small businesses and their accountants to be more confident about future cash position and to help them make better financial decisions. Fluidly plugs into accounting software packages such as Xero, QuickBooks and Sage and combines financial data with machine learning techniques to produce a cashflow forecast that requires absolutely no modelling.<br /><br />We’ve recently been selected for the FinTech50 2018 “Hot 10” list and we are really excited that we’re one of 12 finalists for the Nesta Open Up challenge, designed for companies who are transforming small business banking.<br /><br />Within the accounting industry we’ve been nominated for the AccountingWeb Forecasting, Planning & Analysis Software of the Year and Innovation of the Year. We’ve also recently been featured in the Sunday Times, the Telegraph and Wired and have been described as “one of the true disruptors of the fintech industry”.<br /><br />Fluidly is backed by some of the UK’s leading technology investors and we have a diverse, top-tier team across the board, drawn from leading firms and universities. Our Founder/CEO is a serial entrepreneur, recently awarded an OBE for services to Business: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolineplumb/<br /><br />*About the role*<br />You will be reporting to the CTO and will be a senior member of the engineering team. Initially, your job is to help us focus on scaling out the product as we bring on more users. You must be comfortable working across the stack, implementing UI features and scaling our infrastructure and databases as the amount of data we handle increases. You will also be involved in monitoring and management of our services. It’s a small team and we all need to help each other out - this helps us all communicate better.<br /><br />You’ll have significant experience building production software and thoroughly understand the quirks of web development, ideally with React.js and Node.js. You will also have been deep into the data tier and will be comfortable tuning SQL and Mongo queries, identifying bottlenecks in distributed systems and fixing them, and automating platform-related maintenance tasks. On the front end, you should be able to build out a feature so that it just works (don’t worry, we have a designer who will make sure that it is pretty and user-friendly!).<br /><br />Technology wise, the solution is a full stack javascript (React + Node) monolithic application. We aim to add other tech such as golang, clojure and microservices to the stack as we scale, but for now productivity is our main priority so we are keeping things simple.<br /><br />*Interview process*<br /><br />*Skype call* <br />A short conversation of 15-30 minutes to find out a little bit more about you and tell you all about the company and what we are trying to achieve.<br /><br />*Take home technical exercise* <br />Everyone hates technical exercises so we want this to be as painless as possible. We have a standard exercise that will take 1-2 hours depending on experience - you can do this at home on your own equipment without a stranger standing over you.<br /><br />*On site interview* <br />You will bring in your technical exercise and we’ll talk through your solution and your experience more generally. After that we will do a pair programming exercise that’ll take about an hour.<br /><br />*Meet the Team* <br />Depending on our / your schedules this might be a on different day to the technical interview. Come and meet the rest of the team and ask us anything.<br /><br />*Compensation*<br /><br />* The most competitive salary we can afford. We are an early stage startup and have to make our seed funding last. This means we can’t afford to compete directly on salary. As we grow, we will close this gap quickly. Dependent on experience (DOE).<br />* Meaningful equity. We want people to have a serious stake in the business so that all of our interests are aligned. It’s your baby too. DOE.<br />* 25 days holiday - and we will make you take it. Sure, there will be some long days, but burnout is not big or clever.<br />* Limitless challenge and scope for development.<br />* As much of our time as you need. You professional growth is important to us, and we want to help you to be awesome. It’s not just technical, Caroline will be helping build your commercial and business skills too, if that’s something you are interested in.<br />* Sensible problem that will add real value to real people. This isn’t an HBO parody company.<br />* Flexible working where possible. We like being in the office because it should be fun. All the same if you need to leave early on ${DAY} to make the school run, that’s no problem.<br />* All the crisps (and fruit) you can eat.<br /><br /><br />You can learn a little more about us here:<br /><br />https://www.accountingweb.co.uk/tech/tech-pulse/fluidlys-top-10-partnership-shows-professions-ai-appetite<br /><br />https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/why-entrepreneur-turned-down-richard-branson-mckinsey-start-own-business/entrepreneurs/article/1463042<br /><br />https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/why-entrepreneur-turned-down-richard-branson-mckinsey-start-own-business/entrepreneurs/article/1463042"
