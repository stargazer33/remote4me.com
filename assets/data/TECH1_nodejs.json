The Yoto ecosystem revolves around a curated library of stories, music, activities, sound effects, podcasts and radio. Children listen to the content on Yoto Player, a safely connected speaker that is controlled using physical cards with NFC technology. Additionally the Yoto App allows parents to retain a level of control, enabling volume control, remote play and more.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We launched our first hardware product, Yoto Player, on <a href='https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/yoto/yoto-a-clever-speaker-for-kids/'>Kickstarter</a> in November 2017, reaching its funding target after only 5 days, and receiving a Red Dot Design award in the process.

The container shipping industry is the back-bone and enabler of global trade, but it is struggling. At its core the industry is fundamentally inefficient: 50% of all container vessels globally are delayed coming into port, and key planning processes are done manually on a global scale.

Every company is becoming a software company and developers are at the center of this shift. They need better tools and building blocks so they can stay focused on innovating. One of these building blocks is identity: authentication and authorization. That’s what we do. Our platform handles 2.5B logins per month for thousands of customers around the world. From indie makers to Fortune 500 companies, we can handle any use case. We like to think that we are helping make the internet safer.We have raised $210M to date and are growing quickly. Our team is spread across more than 35 countries and we are proud to continually be recognized as a great place to work. Culture is critical to us, and we are transparent about our&nbsp;<a href='https://auth0.com/blog/the-developer-first-identity-platform-auth0-story-and-future' rel='nofollow'>vision and principles</a>.Join us on this journey to make developers more productive while making the internet safer!<strong>What's the opportunity?</strong>As we scale Auth0 and handle billions of logins per month, we also have to deal with&nbsp;<strong>billions of attacks</strong>. Almost 40% of our traffic are bots trying to get access to our customers accounts and our job is to not let that happen.At the same time we want to provide a great experience to our users and let them know when something suspicious is going on: someone logged in from a device that was not seen before; from a place that would be impossible based on previous activity; from a TOR node; etc.Finding the&nbsp;<strong>right balance between security and user experience</strong>&nbsp;is a hard problem to solve.

Since 2015, our services have saved over 40M lbs of food, 1.2B gallons of water, and 110M lbs CO2, while donating 3M lbs of food along the way. Our software engineering team builds the eCommerce platform and internal tooling that makes this all possible. The team partners closely with product management to develop features, solutions, and systems that enhance and transform the user experience. Engineers don’t just build widgets -- we participate in the full lifecycle of a feature, from conception to release. We’re a remote-first team, with members located throughout the US. This role will report to the Head of Engineering and can be remotely located within US time zones. We have exciting growth ahead of us as we evolve from only produce to a full-service grocery, as well as expand our footprint to serve an even greater portion of the country.

    "content": "<p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>About the company</strong></p><br /><p>LandInsight is a new platform that is fundamentally changing how the property industry buys land for development. It&rsquo;s a big data platform that speeds up the process of finding, assessing and buying land. It comes at an important time, one of the biggest challenges for the UK housing crisis is tackling the shortage of development land. Our tech has changed the game and as a result we&rsquo;ve become the UK&rsquo;s fastest growing PropTech company (and we&rsquo;ve got the awards to prove it!).</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>Our culture</strong></p><br /><p>We live and breath our values of &lsquo;open&rsquo;, &lsquo;empower&rsquo; and &lsquo;home&rsquo;, they are in the footprints of all we do and who we are.</p><br /><p>We truly believe that businesses flourish when people are empowered to work collaboratively and harmoniously. That&rsquo;s why we prioritise team building, high engagement and knowledge sharing in every thread of company. Sitting in our open plan offices means not only knowing the founders, but also learning about the conception and scale of a startup.</p><br /><p>We don&rsquo;t just make empty gestures about our culture - we were voted as the 3rd best UK SaaS Company to work at, and have also received awards for &lsquo;Best at Employee Development&rsquo;.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check out our tech blog <a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Ftech-blog.landinsight.io%2F' rel='nofollow noreferrer noopener'>here</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>Your mission </strong></p><br /><p>At the heart of our product is open data, which we pull in from a wide range of sources. Our customers expect the data to be up to date, accurate, and intelligently integrated into our platform.</p><br /><p>The datasets typically contain 1-30 million items. In some cases this is nice and clean at the point we receive it, but in other cases we have to use a combination of machine-learning and hand-crafted algorithms to extract metadata from plain text or pdfs. Also, since most of our data is geospatial, we focus a lot on geocoding data accurately and joining across geospatial datasets.</p><br /><p>In this role, you will first need to assess the infrastructure we currently have, as built by our full-stack engineers. You will then plan how to migrate towards a more robust system, this includes building tools and processes that will empower our remote contractors to keep a check on, and maintain, parts of the system (e.g. scrapers). Importantly, the new system will need to be flexible as we add new datasets and squeeze more meaning from existing datasets.</p><br /><p>A second aspect of the role will be working with geospatial data generated by our users. This part of the business is more in its infancy, but we have grand ambitions for it and would want you to aid in the decision making, even if not working on the implementation yourself.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong data-redactor-tag=&quot;strong&quot;>Key Responsibilities</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Developing (improving existing and/or creating new) interfaces and/or pipelines to facilitate data collection.</li><br /><li>Identifying, debugging and fixing issues. This includes liaising with other technical/non-technical staff.</li><br /><li>Working closely with remote colleagues (technical and non-technical) who also work on data projects</li><br /><li>Improving our algorithms that derive data from the incoming datasets.</li><br /><li>Educating our full-stack engineers to be better data engineers.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>You are highly competent in one or more programming languages (5+ years experience)</li><br /><li>You are able to reason about the behaviour of systems before starting to build them</li><br /><li>You have built a variety of data processing/management systems</li><br /><li>You have experience with various data visualisation and business intelligence systems</li><br /><li>You are a clear communicator in both written and verbal forms</li><br /><li>AWS is desirable</li><br /><li>NodeJS (or simply JavaScript) is desirable</li><br /><li>MongoDB is desirable</li><br /><li>Postgres is desirable</li><br /><li>Elasticsearch is desirable</li><br /><li>Geographical Information Systems is desirable</li><br /><li>ScrapingHub is desirable</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Flexible working hours</li><br /><li>Professional and personal training budget</li><br /><li>Competitive salary and equity options</li><br /><li>25 days paid holiday (additional to bank holidays)</li><br /><li>Unlimited unpaid holidays</li><br /><li>Dog friendly office</li><br /><li>Loads of social events, including a quarterly away day, an annual ski trip and monthly socials</li><br /><li>Gym and wellness contributions, and a cycle to work scheme</li><br /><li>Dedication to hiring for cultural fit, so you know you&rsquo;re going to be sitting next to someone who you want to grab a beer/glass of prosecco with (usually at the free WeWork bar we have available after 2pm every day!</li><br /></ul>",

We’re passionate about helping companies transform their static digital content into engaging experiences. From custom interactive microcontent, to immersive event microsites, you can build it with Ceros. Publish and update live content instantly, and embed it into your site instantly. Join us in ending the endless creation of static content and be part of the movement towards meaningful content experiences.</p><p>We are well-funded and venture-backed by prominent investors including Grotech Ventures, Greycroft, and Starvest Partners.</p><p><strong>About the Product</strong></p><p>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</p><p>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</p><p>We’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Docker, Jenkins, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</p><p><strong>About the Team</strong></p><p>As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with.

We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it’s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO’s atrocious spelling.</p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p>Working completely from home, you’ll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing.

We will pay you $500 per game.&nbsp;These are simple games, so they shouldn't take you too long to create. Interested? Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 72 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p><p>While we’ve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p><p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p><ul><li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li><li>Working on interesting technical problems that haven’t been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li><li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li><li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li><li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li></ul><p>…you should reach out.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Any computer / tech you want</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We brought Docker to embedded GNU/Linux devices in 2013 and have been building our IoT toolkit ever since. We also maintain a variety of successful open source projects including&nbsp;<a href='https://etcher.io/' rel='nofollow'>Etcher</a>, <a href='https://www.balena.io/open' rel='nofollow'>openBalena</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/engine' rel='nofollow'>balenaEngine</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/os/' rel='nofollow'>balenaOS</a>, and made contributions to high-exposure projects such as&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/' rel='nofollow'>Docker</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://electronjs.org/' rel='nofollow'>Electron</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://appimage.org/' rel='nofollow'>AppImage</a>.</p><p>Our technology is open, standards-based, and proven in production across a wide range of scenarios from drones, 3D printers, point-of-sale devices, tidal turbines, skyscrapers and more. Our investors include DFJ, Aspect Ventures, GE, and Ericsson.</p><p>Balena&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href='https://resin.io/team/' rel='nofollow'>highly distributed, remote-friendly company</a>&nbsp;with a pretty much flat hierarchy. Our organization is adaptive, getting feedback signals from our users and systems. Right now we organize ourselves by projects, which allow us to build complex features and solve big problems, while staying mutable. As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

While balena focuses on IoT, the majority of our senior engineers don't require embedded programming expertise.</p><p>People who are successful as senior engineers are well-rounded generalists. Senior engineers are capable of designing, architecting and own the execution of one or more projects. You are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because you have the context of what’s important.</p><p>Balena has a complex, interdependent system of systems, and we think senior engineers should want to build with the entire company in mind, using and enhancing the libraries that are shared across projects. We actively value investment in our own technology.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we’d rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p><p><strong>Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>You have extremely good problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces.</li><li>You have the software engineering skills to solve problems.</li><li>You can execute and complete software projects.</li><li>You understand and apply good software engineering practices (version control, linters, tests, good commit messages)</li><li>You are comfortable presenting and discussing ideas with fellow balenista's.</li><li>An excellent written communicator, fluent in English.</li><li>You are able to work remotely, with a remote team around the world.</li><li>You understand how your work fits into the product as whole, and you’ll raise a flag if it’s not making sense.</li></ul><p><strong>Skills we’re looking for</strong></p><ul><li>You understand the high level goals, and thus know how to prioritize your and potentially your team’s work.</li><li>You think about how to make yourself and others more effective, you’d be bothered by an inefficient process.</li><li>You separate ego from critique of your work and decisions, and can articulate criticism of others’ work and decisions well.</li><li>Interest in Node.js, Linux - these are the tools you will be working with</li><li>Experience leading a software project</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points for the following</strong></p><ul><li>Leadership experience, like leading a team, mentoring, helping people reach agreement</li><li>Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)</li><li>A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)</li><li>Having worked remotely before</li><li>Interest in embedded systems</li></ul><p>BENEFITS</p><ul><li>Work with extremely talented, diverse team</li><li>Equipment of your choice</li><li>Remote-friendly</li><li>Flexible working hours</li><li>Flexible vacation policy</li><li>Annual company gathering in an international location</li><li>We send you hardware for side projects!</li></ul><p><strong>About working at balena</strong></p><p>We come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://workable.com/j/299979DA26' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Balena</h4>            <div><p>Balena's mission to unlock the potential of physical computing by removing friction for IoT fleet owners.

Jellyfish gathers all information company wide and makes it a platform to implement processes that enhance the team's productivity and understanding. Think of it as a cross between Slack and Excel!\\n\\nThe improved problem space visibility and communication flow that the platform provides to the team is then leveraged to help build and improve both internal and customer facing products. Multiple teams across the company are already relying on the Jellyfish platform for their daily tasks.\\n\\nJellyfish adopts a revolutionary and cutting edge architecture:\\n\\n\\n* The external interface is based on JSON Schema and JSON Patch\\n\\n* Actions on the system are asynchronous by default\\n\\n* The UI is auto-generated based on the data\\n\\n* It can seamlessly integrate with external services such as GitHub and Discourse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Jellyfish team consists of a small group of tight-knit engineers who take pride on moving hyper fast without sacrificing quality by investing on automation, testing, and great engineering practices.\\n\\nWe don't require engineers to be already familiar with the technologies we use.

You'd be bothered by an inefficient process\\n\\n* Desire to make yourself and others more effective. You'd be bothered by an inefficient process\\n\\n* Good understanding of software engineering practices and how to apply them\\n\\n* Excellent written communication skills, and fluency in English\\n\\n* Self-discipline to take on a project and push it to completion without too much management. You also know when to ask for help\\n\\n* Highly organized, able to handle many threads at once, and keep things moving\\n\\n* Strong problem-solving abilities. You know how to split a complex problem into incremental pieces\\n\\n* Strong understanding of HTTP\\n\\n* Experience working on distributed systems\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNice to have:\\n\\n\\n* A sample of your work (URL or attached sample)\\n\\n* Contributions to OSS projects (please include a URL)\\n\\n* Having worked remotely before\\n\\n* Experience with balena as a user\\n\\n* Experience with embedded GNU/Linux, anything ranging from personal projects with a Raspberry Pi to commercial or industrial scenarios with custom devices\\n\\n* Experience with PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, and Node.js\\n\\n* Experience with JSON Schema\\n\\n* Experience with NoSQL or graph databases\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMake sure to let us know if any of these items apply to you!\\n\\nABOUT WORKING AT BALENA\\n\\nWe come from 15+ countries, and we embrace a remote culture with flexible hours. To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.\\n\\nBENEFITS\\n\\n\\n* Work with an extremely talented, diverse team\\n\\n* Equipment of your choice\\n\\n* Remote-friendly\\n\\n* Flexible working hours\\n\\n* Generous vacation policy\\n\\n* Annual company gathering in an international location - this year, Barcelona in October\\n\\n* We send you hardware for side projects!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTO APPLY\\n\\nWe're delighted to hear about you!

We brought Docker to embedded GNU/Linux devices in 2013 and have been building our IoT toolkit ever since. We also maintain a variety of successful open source projects including&nbsp;<a href='https://etcher.io/' rel='nofollow'>Etcher</a>, <a href='https://www.balena.io/open' rel='nofollow'>openBalena</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/engine' rel='nofollow'>balenaEngine</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/os/' rel='nofollow'>balenaOS</a>, and made contributions to high-exposure projects such as&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/' rel='nofollow'>Docker</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://electronjs.org/' rel='nofollow'>Electron</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://appimage.org/' rel='nofollow'>AppImage</a>.</p><p>Our technology is open, standards-based, and proven in production across a wide range of scenarios from drones, 3D printers, point-of-sale devices, tidal turbines, skyscrapers and more.

Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
