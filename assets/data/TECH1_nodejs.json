Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.<br>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. Thats a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.<br><br> <br>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, FT, Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Australian Herald to name a few. Hundreds of thousands of families have downloaded the RoosterMoney app since our launch in January 2016. We are looking for a talented and motivated senior UI developer to join our team to help us achieve even more amazing things. We have a generous share option scheme and youll be joining us as we expand across a number of new territories. <br><br><br>THE ROLE:<br>We're looking for a software developer who has held mid-senior positions on front-end engineering teams, who will operate with a high level of autonomy. <br>You will be developing our core RoosterMoney app and working across the platform as a whole within our small but growing product team (currently 8), building an application that is used by families around the world. You have a passion for UX and UI, best practice development and building a product that delights users on a daily basis, taking pride in shipping quality code that is easy to test, maintain and build on. You care deeply about building applications with well thought out architecture.<br><br><br> Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node APIs where required.<br><br><br>We are a small team so its important that the successful candidate isnt just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.<br><br><br>Apply if you want to:<br> * Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.<br> * Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.<br> * Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.<br> * Develop robust deployment and testing processes <br> * Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.<br> <br><br><br>Benefits<br><br>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> <br> * Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.<br> * 25 days holiday<br> * Pension Scheme<br> * Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.<br> * We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office. We run a Remote working structure as a team (we currently have team members in London, Bristol and Stoke in the UK and Barcelona, Spain) so time zone variance (and travel distance) has to be sensible. <br> <br><br><br><br>We can't offer visa sponsorship at this time. <p>See more jobs at <span>Roostermoney</span></p></div></div>"

We primarily do so through&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/Medi-Share/Medi-Share.aspx' rel='nofollow'>Medi-Share</a>, but as an association of churches, we’re rapidly expanding our “ministry portfolio” and we think technology will be at the center of accomplishing that goal. That’s where you come in. We need help creating and supporting applications (mobile + browser) for the future products and projects we’ve got in the proverbial “hopper.”</p><p>But before we go any further, you need to know if you’ll like working with us. We think you will.</p><p><strong>A bit about us:&nbsp;</strong>You already know the mission of Christian Care Ministry (CCM). We have about 580 employees in various states, but most of them are either at our headquarters in Melbourne, FL, or our Colorado Springs, CO branch. Medi-Share has been growing in every way imaginable since about 2010. It has become commonplace for our CFO to say things like “We’ve grown 30% year over year …again” at seemingly every quarterly employee town hall meeting. We’re extremely humbled and grateful to the Lord for the growth.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is a community of Christians that requires its employees to share its Christian religious beliefs and practices. CCM complies with all anti-discrimination laws applicable to religious employers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the role:</strong>&nbsp;This position serves on the New Product Engineering Team in a Product Team setting. This small, sub-department of our IT team (which is currently under 10 people) is mostly remote. Their main focus has been making some dreams of the leadership team come true (well, at least the dreams that involve amazing code :).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Life as an Employee with CCM’s New Product Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong>We work really hard to make working here an amazing experience. It’s hard to find great talent like you, but if you pick us, we want to keep you for a long time. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Do you prefer mountains or oceans?</strong></p><p>While the majority of the NPE Team is distributed, it is our overwhelming preference that you live near our Colorado Springs, CO office or our headquarters in Melbourne, FL.&nbsp; However, with modern tools, proximity doesn’t influence productivity and if absolutely necessary, we can discuss an exception. For this job in particular, we do need some collaboration though, so just make sure you have a reliable internet connection, of course.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>The New Product Engineering Team is operating in “start up” mode. This means that we work hard and smart to get projects completed in a reasonable timeline. On occasion, there may be instances when extra time is needed (usually around a product launch or a really big release), but those are pretty infrequent. Basically, we commit you to at least 6 hours of coding per day in our Sprints and as long as you get the work done, we’re okay with when you get it done. Just be available when the team may need your help, or when you may need their help. Sometimes life happens in the middle of the day, and we understand that. We also think “more meetings” means less time for coding so we protect your time. We have one morning stand-up at 10am EST where we find out when there could be overlap that day. Oh, one more cool thing about the only meeting you attend – we “eat our own dog food” and close each stand-up praying for Medi-Share members’ needs listed in our mobile app.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it by giving you those extra 2 hours per workday to collaborate or learn. The stack we generally work on is relatively new so taking time to hone in your skills is pretty imperative. We send members to conferences or webinars as we need to. We love seeing our people growing.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer…</strong></p><p>This is the part where we describe the experience necessary to be considered for the position.</p><p>You’re a skilled developer, but maybe you haven’t gotten a chance to prove it yet professionally. We can give you that chance.&nbsp;</p><p>But before you get _too_ excited, let me explain. We only hire great developers, and this position is no exception. When we ask you to write or debug code during our interviews, you’ll do so confidently. You might not be able to show us 5 applications you’ve shipped, but you can point to something recent you’ve spent significant time coding that you’re really proud of, like your university project, your open source contributions, or your project at your last job. If we ask your professors, classmates, or coworkers about you, they’ll have great things to say.</p><p>In short, we won’t teach you how to be a good programmer, since you already are, but we can certainly help you be a better, professionally-experienced programmer.</p><p>Our ideal candidate either has a college degree in computer science, or if not, 2+ years of recent, solid professional programming experience. Our especially ideal candidate has experience with either Node.js or React.js. Having only done that in your free time is fine. That tells us you are curious enough to learn on your own.</p><p>Our stack contains a very healthy JavaScript client utilizing Heroku, Node.js, React.js, and a few others. CCM is in the process of migrating to Salesforce so we often interact with their APIs. For our mobile apps we’re using React Native, because, well, basically, it’s awesome (and we really think our philosophies of “API First” and “Learn Once, Code Everywhere” are going to be the norm in the near future). Our backend API servers use either Ruby on Rails or Node.js/Express, with PostgreSQL and Redis as our data layer. Despite those being our “sweet spots” before we take on a new product, we pick the stack that works best for that solution.</p><p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are curious how things work, you are self-motivated and self-driven.</li><li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li><li>Thrive with directions like:<ul><li>“Here is the mock up for feature X. How do you think we should approach this?”</li><li>&quot;Check out the Jira story and play a bit with library X on GitHub. This might solve our problem Y.

Whether we’re helping developers get answers to their questions or find new jobs, we build products that affect millions of developers’ lives every day. Our goal is to create a community and a company where everyone feels welcome to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers. We’re not there yet, which is why we’re hoping you’ll join us!</p><p>In this 11-week apprenticeship program, you’ll work directly alongside a developer mentor on a real product team. Rather than doing independent “intern” projects that may not ever ship, as an apprentice you’ll work with your mentor to learn, review, debug, and ship features to real users. You’ll also work collaboratively with other members of the team, including other developers, designers, and product managers.</p><p>Some recent projects we’ve been working on that you might contribute to:</p><ul></ul><li>Our newest products,&nbsp;&nbsp;and for&nbsp;, which give organizations a private, secure home for their team’s questions and answers.</li><a href='https://stackoverflow.com/teams' rel='nofollow'>Stack Overflow for Teams</a><a href='https://stackoverflow.com/enterprise' rel='nofollow'>Enterprise</a><li>New experiments on Stack Overflow&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;to help companies reach and engage developers with job and advertising opportunities.</li><a href='https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/talent' rel='nofollow'>Talent</a><a href='https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/engagement' rel='nofollow'>Engagement</a><li>Modifying the Ask a Question page and comments in order to make Stack Overflow easier to use and more welcoming to newcomers.</li><p>You’ll work primarily in our main tech stack of C#, ASP.NET, and Microsoft SQL Server. We don’t expect you to know those technologies coming in, so we’ll pair you with mentors who will help you learn and develop.</p><p>We’re a remote-first team, so you’ll have the option to work from home or out of our New York office. Wherever you work, you’ll be part of a remote work culture that emphasizes online communication (Trello, Slack, GitHub, Hangouts) and asynchronous collaboration wherever possible.</p><p></p><strong>Timing</strong><p>We are accepting applications on a rolling basis until the positions are filled for a target start date of&nbsp;.

For example, what you might have learned from having just completed a coding bootcamp or an undergraduate degree. You should have exposure to all parts of the stack: server-side web development, front-end JS/HTML/CSS, and some exposure to SQL.&nbsp;, but knowing some other web development framework will help you get up to speed more quickly (e.g. Node.js, Ruby-on-Rails).</li><strong>Intro-level web development skills</strong><em>You don’t have to be an expert in our stack</em><li>&nbsp;that you built which you can walk us through, whether it was something you built yourself in your spare time, as part of course work, or in a previous job or internship.</li><strong>An example project</strong><li>&nbsp;(especially if working remote), and comfort with communicating via chat and video calls. You’ll also need to have a quiet space free from interruptions where you’ll work.</li><strong>Great time-management skills</strong><p></p><strong>What you’ll get in return:</strong><ul></ul><li>Real-world dev experience on a top-notch team. If we’re hiring junior roles when you finish, you’ll be considered, but if not you’ll get great some experience to put on your resume.</li><li>Competitive compensation: $1770 / week in the US (ask us for the salary if you’re outside the US).</li><li>Flexible hours, as long as you make sure you can overlap with your mentor’s work schedule.</li><li>In the US, full employee benefits like health insurance and 401k matching.</li><li>Employees will never be poked with a sharp stick.</li><p>&nbsp;We’ll send you a laptop and equipment to help you be productive from wherever you work for the duration of the program.</p><strong>If you want to work remotely….</strong><p>You’ll enjoy additional benefits like free lunch every day prepared by our own in-house chefs, transportation reimbursement, and all the espresso you can drink.</p><strong>If you want to work in our office…&nbsp;</strong><p></p><strong>About Stack Overflow</strong><p>&nbsp;is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their knowledge, and build their careers.

We primarily do so through&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/Medi-Share/Medi-Share.aspx' rel='nofollow'>Medi-Share</a>, but as an association of churches, we’re rapidly expanding our “ministry portfolio” and we think technology will be at the center of accomplishing that goal. That’s where you come in. We need help creating and supporting applications (mobile + browser) for the future products and projects we’ve got in the proverbial “hopper.”</p><p>But before we go any further, you need to know if you’ll like working with us. We think you will.</p><p><strong>A bit about us:&nbsp;</strong>You already know the mission of Christian Care Ministry (CCM). We have about 580 employees in various states, but most of them are either at our headquarters in Melbourne, FL, or our Colorado Springs, CO branch. Medi-Share has been growing in every way imaginable since about 2010. It has become commonplace for our CFO to say things like “We’ve grown 30% year over year …again” at seemingly every quarterly employee town hall meeting. We’re extremely humbled and grateful to the Lord for the growth.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is a community of Christians that requires its employees to share its Christian religious beliefs and practices. CCM complies with all anti-discrimination laws applicable to religious employers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>About the role:</strong>&nbsp;This position serves on the New Product Engineering Team in a Product Team setting. This small, sub-department of our IT team (which is currently under 10 people) is mostly remote. Their main focus has been making some dreams of the leadership team come true (well, at least the dreams that involve amazing code :).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Life as an Employee with CCM’s New Product Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong>We work really hard to make working here an amazing experience. It’s hard to find great talent like you, but if you pick us, we want to keep you for a long time. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Do you prefer mountains or oceans?</strong></p><p>While the majority of the NPE Team is distributed, it is our overwhelming preference that you live near our Colorado Springs, CO office or our headquarters in Melbourne, FL.&nbsp; However, with modern tools, proximity doesn’t influence productivity and if absolutely necessary, we can discuss an exception. For this job in particular, we do need some collaboration though, so just make sure you have a reliable internet connection, of course.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>The New Product Engineering Team is operating in “start up” mode. This means that we work hard and smart to get projects completed in a reasonable timeline. On occasion, there may be instances when extra time is needed (usually around a product launch or a really big release), but those are pretty infrequent. Basically, we commit you to at least 6 hours of coding per day in our Sprints and as long as you get the work done, we’re okay with when you get it done. Just be available when the team may need your help, or when you may need their help. Sometimes life happens in the middle of the day, and we understand that. We also think “more meetings” means less time for coding so we protect your time. We have one morning stand-up at 10am EST where we find out when there could be overlap that day. Oh, one more cool thing about the only meeting you attend – we “eat our own dog food” and close each stand-up praying for Medi-Share members’ needs listed in our mobile app.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it by giving you those extra 2 hours per workday to collaborate or learn. The stack we generally work on is relatively new so taking time to hone in your skills is pretty imperative. We send members to conferences or webinars as we need to. We love seeing our people growing.</p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Full Stack Developer…</strong></p><p>This is the part where we describe the experience necessary to be considered for the position.</p><p>You’re a skilled developer, but maybe you haven’t gotten a chance to prove it yet professionally. We can give you that chance.&nbsp;</p><p>But before you get _too_ excited, let me explain. We only hire great developers, and this position is no exception. When we ask you to write or debug code during our interviews, you’ll do so confidently. You might not be able to show us 5 applications you’ve shipped, but you can point to something recent you’ve spent significant time coding that you’re really proud of, like your university project, your open source contributions, or your project at your last job. If we ask your professors, classmates, or coworkers about you, they’ll have great things to say.</p><p>In short, we won’t teach you how to be a good programmer, since you already are, but we can certainly help you be a better, professionally-experienced programmer.</p><p>Our ideal candidate either has a college degree in computer science, or if not, 2+ years of recent, solid professional programming experience. Our especially ideal candidate has experience with either Node.js or React.js. Having only done that in your free time is fine. That tells us you are curious enough to learn on your own.</p><p>Our stack contains a very healthy JavaScript client utilizing Heroku, Node.js, React.js, and a few others. CCM is in the process of migrating to Salesforce so we often interact with their APIs. For our mobile apps we’re using React Native, because, well, basically, it’s awesome (and we really think our philosophies of “API First” and “Learn Once, Code Everywhere” are going to be the norm in the near future). Our backend API servers use either Ruby on Rails or Node.js/Express, with PostgreSQL and Redis as our data layer. Despite those being our “sweet spots” before we take on a new product, we pick the stack that works best for that solution.</p><p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are curious how things work, you are self-motivated and self-driven.</li><li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers to understand and use.</li><li>Thrive with directions like:<ul><li>“Here is the mock up for feature X. How do you think we should approach this?”</li><li>&quot;Check out the Jira story and play a bit with library X on GitHub. This might solve our problem Y. Let's discuss the pros and cons tomorrow.&quot; &nbsp;</li><li>&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it and why do you think that's a good idea?&quot;</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li><li>You got a smirk on your face when you saw you could work on the stack listed above, AT A MINISTRY!</li><li>As you’ve read this job description, you realize this team obviously is comprised of people who you’d enjoy spending a work week with. (ended that sentence with a preposition, we're not paid for our grammatical skills)</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus Points</strong></p><ul><li>You already are a Medi-Share member or would want to join membership even if you didn’t work here.</li><li>You’ve built stuff using React Native (even if it was for your mom’s bingo club or something crazier).</li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p>Super important stuff that sounds like it was written by lawyers:</p><p>This job description in no way states or implies that these are the only duties to be performed by the employee(s) incumbent in this position. Employee(s) will be required to follow any other job-related instructions and to perform any other job-related duties requested by any person authorized to give instructions or assignments. This document does not create an employment contract, implied or otherwise, other than an &quot;at will&quot; relationship.</p><p>Christian Care Ministry is committed to&nbsp;serving&nbsp;the Lord and our membership with excellence. As&nbsp;employees&nbsp;we are&nbsp;committed to adhering&nbsp;to the same standard of Biblical principles of lifestyle and health as required for membership in our Medi-Share program which include:</p><ul><li>Have a verifiable Christian testimony indicating a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, and profess the&nbsp;<a href='https://mychristiancare.org/what_we_believe.aspx' rel='nofollow'><strong>Statement of Faith</strong></a></li><li>Attend a fellowship of believers, regularly and actively support that ministry, and live under the discipline of that body</li><li>Share the conviction that believers are to bear one another’s burdens according to Galatians 6:2</li><li>Believe the Biblical doctrine that their bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;are to be kept pure</li><li>Must not engage in sex outside of traditional Christian marriage</li><li>Cannot use tobacco or illegal drugs in any form, or abuse legal drugs or alcohol</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;How To Apply</strong></p><ul><li>Apply here. In your cover letter, introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and why you would be a great fit.</li><li>Please include links to apps you’ve built or anything else that makes you look good, and describe your role in building those apps. (If they’re internal, you can skip the link part.)</li><li>If you have a prepared resume, attach it in PDF form. If you don’t have a resume because you aren’t even sure you’re looking to change jobs, that’s fine! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for. Plus, you’ll see at our site we ask for a lot of the same info anyway.</li><li>Please complete the following questions, and include them with your cover letter. This shouldn’t take you very long.<ul><li>What are your two strongest programming languages? Is there another language that you’re curious to learn next?</li><li>If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?</li><li>In a 2-3 sentences, what has your life with Jesus looked like over the last 3 weeks? There’s no wrong answer.</li></ul></li></ul><p>There will be a few other things if we get past the first interview, but we’ll cover that later. We even like doing our hiring on an iterative basis.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://boards.greenhouse.io/christiancareministry/jobs/1215334' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>                    <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Onsite gym</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>15 days PTO</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>$621/month flex earnings for health coverage</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

This will give the artist a chance to go head to head with other users and have their respective followers vote, comment, rate, and share. As well as giving them an opportunity to collaborate with an artist that they wouldn't normally be able to work with.</p><p>3. With these unique features, TrndStar will allow users the ability to leverage other users to grow their following and fanbase. This will allow them to gain followers 10 times faster than any other social platform.</p><p>4. Trndstar isn't exclusive to just artists and people wanting to share their talents.

    "content": "<p>Full-time</p><p><strong>(Boston, MA - USA Only)</strong> </p><p>Openly is building a next-generation insurance company from the ground up. We’re questioning the way things have been done in this industry for over a hundred years with an open mind to how customers want insurance to work—everything from how insurance is quoted &amp; sold, to the back-end operations that frustrate everyone and waste money. Insurance is one of a few remaining greenfield industries, with many interesting engineering problems that need a fresh perspective.</p><p>This isn’t something we’ve undertaken on a whim—we’ve been at this for a year, and planning for several years. We know we can do this because we’re the right mix of contrarian ideas backed by subject-matter expertise. The founding team brings executive-level experience from Liberty Mutual Insurance and Goldman Sachs, with mastery in actuarial science, computer engineering, math, and finance (MIT, Duke, and the University of Michigan). You can read more about the founders <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/ty-harris-73a40816/' rel='nofollow'>here</a> and <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-wielbut/' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. &nbsp;The rest of the team--the real strength of the company--are key early hires who are experts in their respective fields of statistics, actuarial science, and engineering. In aggregate, across the company, we’ve essentially built all of this before.&nbsp;</p><p>We were one of the 10 companies selected to Boston Techstars 2018 class. You can watch our <a href='https://vimeo.com/267654520' rel='nofollow'>Demo Day video here</a> to learn more about what we’re building.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a long runway and path to additional funding; we recently closed an oversubscribed round with a mix of amazing VCs and an exclusive group of angels made up of industry experts and executives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What kind of people do we gravitate to?</em></p><p>As a company, we place great value on curiosity, integrity, and ownership, both as character traits in members of the team, but also in the way we approach business and technical challenges. We want people who thrive in environments where they get to wear multiple hats. We’re looking for someone who wants to spend most of their time coding—a polyglot that is comfortable using multiple languages depending on the task at hand (but need not be a wizard/expert in any one language), and an autodidact who is excited to dive into a deep and quantitative subject matter. Insurance or finance knowledge is not required.</p><p><strong>We’re at a critical point in our company.</strong> Following a successful prototype, we’re now building the first production-version of everything. You will play a pivotal role in helping define everything from our engineering culture to the insurance product upon which customers will rely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What are the responsibilities?</em></p><p>We’re hiring for a senior engineer role. Your primary responsibility will be to develop the backend systems that power the pricing and sale of our insurance products. This includes but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>Integrating with a dozen data vendors to provide real-time information on hundreds of data points; everything from property characteristics, such as roof construction material, to weather-related data that help us predict flood risk or potential hailstorm damage.</li><li>Turning statistical models into production-quality code that can make pricing decisions, assessing a customer’s risk.&nbsp;</li><li>Build a smart qualifier that decides if an applicant is eligible to be insured, while also making sure to avoid purchasing expensive data for a lost cause.</li><li>Make important architectural and operational decisions like microservices vs. monoliths, deployment techniques, technologies, policies, etc.</li><li>Build an API to allow third-party resellers to purchase insurance from us programmatically.&nbsp;</li><li>And tons of future projects: machine learning for fraud detection, satellite/aerial imagery processing, IOT integration, etc.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What skills or qualifications would help you stand out?</em></p><ul><li>Computer science, engineering, or math-focused, college degree or equivalent experience</li><li>You’re proficient in Go/Golang, or some other compiled programming language such as Java or C/C++</li><li>You’ve written code that’s been deployed to production and used by 1,000+ strangers&nbsp;</li><li>You are a problem-solver who can balance between short-term and long-term solutions&nbsp;</li><li>You need to have excellent communication skills</li><li>You are technically proficient enough to solve hard problems independently, but you understand that collaborative solutions are usually better. &nbsp;You’re willing to ask for and offer help to your teammates to achieve the best solution</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>What’s in our stack?</em></p><p>We’re careful to select technologies that are the right fit for solving the specific problem, not just the new hotness. We also place great importance in things we know really well. It’s often the nuances in a language or technology the make or break you in the long run.</p><p>Backend/Core</p><ul><li>Go</li><li>Postgresql</li></ul><p>Frontend:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>VueJS</li><li>Webpack</li><li>NodeJs/Express</li></ul><p>Research/Data Science</p><ul><li>R</li><li>ArcGIS</li><li>Python</li></ul><p>Infrastructure</p><ul><li>Google Cloud</li><li>Kubernetes</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Everything else:</em></p><p>This is full-time position.</p><p>Compensation is a mix of competitive salary and equity. We offer full benefits (medical, dental, vision) and contribute to your 401K.</p><p>We’re Boston-based, but we have some remote employees i.e. we’re open to any US-based applicants.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p><strong>Job Perks:</strong> Equity + full medical benefits + 401K contribution</p><p><strong>Apply:</strong> Send us your resume, GitHub link, or a description of recent projects, and why you'd be a good fit.</p>"

Fluidly plugs into accounting software packages such as Xero, QuickBooks and Sage and combines financial data with machine learning techniques to produce a cashflow forecast that requires absolutely no modelling.<br /><br />We’ve recently been selected for the FinTech50 2018 “Hot 10” list and we are really excited that we’re one of 12 finalists for the Nesta Open Up challenge, designed for companies who are transforming small business banking.<br /><br />Within the accounting industry we’ve been nominated for the AccountingWeb Forecasting, Planning & Analysis Software of the Year and Innovation of the Year. We’ve also recently been featured in the Sunday Times, the Telegraph and Wired and have been described as “one of the true disruptors of the fintech industry”.<br /><br />Fluidly is backed by some of the UK’s leading technology investors and we have a diverse, top-tier team across the board, drawn from leading firms and universities. Our Founder/CEO is a serial entrepreneur, recently awarded an OBE for services to Business: https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolineplumb/<br /><br />*About the role*<br />You will be reporting to the CTO and will be a senior member of the engineering team. Initially, your job is to help us focus on scaling out the product as we bring on more users. You must be comfortable working across the stack, implementing UI features and scaling our infrastructure and databases as the amount of data we handle increases. You will also be involved in monitoring and management of our services. It’s a small team and we all need to help each other out - this helps us all communicate better.<br /><br />You’ll have significant experience building production software and thoroughly understand the quirks of web development, ideally with React.js and Node.js. You will also have been deep into the data tier and will be comfortable tuning SQL and Mongo queries, identifying bottlenecks in distributed systems and fixing them, and automating platform-related maintenance tasks. On the front end, you should be able to build out a feature so that it just works (don’t worry, we have a designer who will make sure that it is pretty and user-friendly!).<br /><br />Technology wise, the solution is a full stack javascript (React + Node) monolithic application. We aim to add other tech such as golang, clojure and microservices to the stack as we scale, but for now productivity is our main priority so we are keeping things simple.<br /><br />*Interview process*<br /><br />*Skype call* <br />A short conversation of 15-30 minutes to find out a little bit more about you and tell you all about the company and what we are trying to achieve.<br /><br />*Take home technical exercise* <br />Everyone hates technical exercises so we want this to be as painless as possible. We have a standard exercise that will take 1-2 hours depending on experience - you can do this at home on your own equipment without a stranger standing over you.<br /><br />*On site interview* <br />You will bring in your technical exercise and we’ll talk through your solution and your experience more generally. After that we will do a pair programming exercise that’ll take about an hour.<br /><br />*Meet the Team* <br />Depending on our / your schedules this might be a on different day to the technical interview. Come and meet the rest of the team and ask us anything.<br /><br />*Compensation*<br /><br />* The most competitive salary we can afford. We are an early stage startup and have to make our seed funding last. This means we can’t afford to compete directly on salary. As we grow, we will close this gap quickly. Dependent on experience (DOE).<br />* Meaningful equity. We want people to have a serious stake in the business so that all of our interests are aligned. It’s your baby too. DOE.<br />* 25 days holiday - and we will make you take it. Sure, there will be some long days, but burnout is not big or clever.<br />* Limitless challenge and scope for development.<br />* As much of our time as you need. You professional growth is important to us, and we want to help you to be awesome. It’s not just technical, Caroline will be helping build your commercial and business skills too, if that’s something you are interested in.<br />* Sensible problem that will add real value to real people. This isn’t an HBO parody company.<br />* Flexible working where possible. We like being in the office because it should be fun. All the same if you need to leave early on ${DAY} to make the school run, that’s no problem.<br />* All the crisps (and fruit) you can eat.<br /><br /><br />You can learn a little more about us here:<br /><br />https://www.accountingweb.co.uk/tech/tech-pulse/fluidlys-top-10-partnership-shows-professions-ai-appetite<br /><br />https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/why-entrepreneur-turned-down-richard-branson-mckinsey-start-own-business/entrepreneurs/article/1463042<br /><br />https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/why-entrepreneur-turned-down-richard-branson-mckinsey-start-own-business/entrepreneurs/article/1463042"

We brought Docker to embedded GNU/Linux devices in 2013 and have been building our IoT toolkit ever since. We also maintain a variety of successful open source projects including&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fetcher.io%2F' rel='nofollow'>Etcher</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.balena.io%2F' rel='nofollow'>Balena</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fresinos.io%2F' rel='nofollow'>resinOS</a>, and made contributions to high-exposure projects such as&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.docker.com%2F' rel='nofollow'>Docker</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Felectronjs.org%2F' rel='nofollow'>Electron</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fappimage.org%2F' rel='nofollow'>AppImage</a>.</p><p>Our technology is open, standards-based, and proven in production across a wide range of scenarios from drones, 3D printers, point-of-sale devices, tidal turbines, skyscrapers and more.

Our organization is adaptive, getting feedback signals from our users and systems. Right now we organize ourselves by projects, which allow us to build complex features and solve big problems, while staying mutable. As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible vacation policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from home and remote working</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Snacks, coffee, beverages at the office</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

As the company behind the popular open source projects — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, and Beats — we help people around the world do great things with their data.

The ingest modules are comprised of Beats modules and Logstash modules - the former being lightweight data shippers that collect data from edge servers and the latter being a centralized data collectors that collect data and ingest it via ingest pipelines to Elasticsearch. Both ingest mechanisms are used to power application monitoring, infrastructure monitoring, and network monitoring.</p><p>We’re looking for engineers that are passionate about data, about infrastructure, and more importantly about combining the two and turning them to valuable and actionable insights via UI.

Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible throughout our organization.

Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. Elastic is backed by $104 million in funding from Benchmark Capital, Index Ventures, and NEA; has headquarters in Amsterdam and Mountain View, California; and has employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.</p><p><strong>Kibana is the window into the Elastic Stack</strong></p><p>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.</p><p>Are you a top Javascript developer who wants to add to Kibana and X-Pack? We want to meet you!</p><p><strong>Engineering Philosophy</strong></p><p>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Innovate, lead and contribute to front end and visualization experience of the Kibana and other UI products using JavaScript</li><li>Collaborate with other development teams, quality engineering team, and documentation team to execute on product work</li></ul><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Strong JavaScript programming skills</li><li>7+ years of front end development work</li><li>Experience with one modern MVC style JS Framework</li><li>Experience writing automated tests</li><li>Ability to work in a fast paced start-up environment</li><li>Excellent verbal and written communication skills, a great teammate with strong analytical, problem solving, debugging and troubleshooting skills</li><li>Strong preference for operational experience</li><li>Strong preference for knowledge of building complex data visualization and related tooling</li><li>Strong preference for Open Source experience</li></ul><p><strong>Additional Information</strong></p><ul><li>Deeply competitive pay, medical, dental, vision, disability, benefits</li><li>Stock options</li><li>Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices</li><li>An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life</li><li>Passionate people building great products</li><li>Employees with a wide variety of interests</li><li>Your age is only a number.

Come to us with strong opinions and a willingness to discuss engineering trade-offs.<br /><br /><br />Experience we are looking for:<br /><br />    You must have worked on back end projects deployed for iOS, Android, and/or both.<br /><br />    We want someone who has developed a mobile app and has been on a small team. Show us that you’ve had ownership of some part of a program you’ve worked on.<br /><br />    Start-up experience is really nice to have. Gaming experience is a plus.<br /><br />    It'd be nice if you've led a team in the past, as this position has the opportunity to grow into a managerial role as we grow the company.<br /><br />    You must have sysadmin / operations experience and be able to set up infrastructure for the app, preferably in a cloud context - systems, network, monitoring, security, etc. <br /><br />We plan on making a number of build-or-buy decisions so experience with integrating third-party tools and/or services is a plus.<br /><br />    Also a huge plus: experience scaling a consumer-facing service, particularly with respect to tuning for performance and reliability."

Elastic is the leading software provider for making structured and unstructured data usable in real time for search, logging, security and analytics use cases. Since its initial release in 2012, Elastic's products have achieved more than 100 million cumulative downloads. Today thousands of organizations like Cisco, eBay, Dell, Goldman Sachs, Groupon, HP, Microsoft, Netflix, NY Times, Uber, Verizon, Yelp, and Wikipedia use the Elastic Stack, X-Pack, and Elastic Cloud to power critical systems that drive new revenue opportunities and massive cost savings. Elastic is backed by $104 million in funding from Benchmark Capital, Index Ventures, and NEA; has headquarters in Amsterdam and Mountain View, California; and has employees across 30+ countries into one coherent team, while the broader community spans across over 100 countries.<br><br>Kibana is the window into the Elastic Stack<br><br>Kibana lets users visualize their Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack, so they can do anything from learning why they’re getting paged at 2:00 a.m. to understanding the impact rain might have on their quarterly numbers. Kibana gives users the freedom to select the way they give shape to their data. And they don’t always have to know what they’re looking for. With its interactive visualizations, users start with one question and see where it leads them. Kibana core ships with the classics: histograms, line graphs, pie charts, sunbursts, and more. They demonstrate the full aggregation capabilities of Elasticsearch.<br><br>Are you a top Javascript developer who wants to add to Kibana and X-Pack? We want to meet you!<br><br>Engineering Philosophy<br><br>Engineering a highly complex distributed system that is easy to operate via elegantly designed APIs is a non-trivial effort. It requires solid software development skills, and more importantly, a sharp mind and the ability to think like a user. We also care deeply about giving you full ownership of what you’re working on. Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.<br><br>Responsibilities<br><br><br>* Innovate, lead and contribute to front end and visualization experience of the Kibana and other UI products using JavaScript<br><br>* Collaborate with other development teams, quality engineering team, and documentation team to execute on product work<br><br><br><br><br>Skills &amp; Requirements<br><br><br>* Strong JavaScript programming skills<br><br>* 7+ years of front end development work<br><br>* Experience with one modern MVC style JS Framework<br><br>* Experience writing automated tests<br><br>* Ability to work in a fast paced start-up environment<br><br>* Excellent verbal and written communication skills, a great teammate with strong analytical, problem solving, debugging and troubleshooting skills<br><br>* Strong preference for operational experience<br><br>* Strong preference for knowledge of building complex data visualization and related tooling<br><br>* Strong preference for Open Source experience<br><br><br><br><br>Additional Information<br><br><br>* Deeply competitive pay, medical, dental, vision, disability, benefits<br><br>* Stock options<br><br>* Catered lunches, snacks, and beverages in most offices<br><br>* An environment in which you can balance great work with a great life<br><br>* Passionate people building great products<br><br>* Employees with a wide variety of interests<br><br>* Your age is only a number.

An ambitious goal, PatientPal automates several difficult tasks that are still mostly human-run today. Through automation we’re improving efficiency, reducing errors and mistakes, and saving clinics and patients time and money. Unfortunately, it is not simple to automate healthcare, so PatientPal is a very goal-oriented company.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We are a small, early stage team looking for great developers who want to join a passionate team and make a difference in healthcare. We focused on keeping PatientPal affordable for our customers and keeping PatientPal robust, flexible, low cost to operate, and therefore affordable to a wide array of clinics, providers, hospitals, and professionals.</span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>We are completely serverless. Relying on modern FaaS, we scale instantly and maintain a low operating cost. Experience with Lambda, DynamoDB, or similar technologies is a plus.</li><li>We are HIPPA compliant. This requires training and requires us to handle data securely. We provide training, but experience or knowledge in encryption, network security, information assurance is a plus.</li><li>We integrate with a lot of services. Rather than recreate, we integrate. We work with lots of APIs, services, and medical industry protocols that will jar the mind of most modern developers. Experience using deprecated APIs, working with difficult integrations that lack documentation, or direct experience with using medical industry standards such as HL7, FHIR, CDA, CCD, X12, DICOM, EDI, and similar protocols is a major plus.</li><li>We are building a modern tool, that is easy to use. The frontend application is in Angular 6. Experience with Angular or similar frontend frameworks is a plus.</li><li>We are accessible to any patients. PatientPal cares about the patient experience. Experience building international, multilingual, and accessible applications is a plus.</li><li>We rely on high quality, self-tested work. We do not have a QA team, but we have a lot of automated testing. An ideal candidate will experience writing unit tests, end-to-end tests, and testing their own work.</li><li>We are a distributed, fully remote team. There are no core hours. Our culture is passion. If you need someone to keep you focused, we are not the team for you. If you get work done without asking, can make suggestions that can improve a product, love taking ownership in your work, and are looking for a team with extremely capable engineers who all feel the same then PatientPal is for you.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span><b>The ideal candidate should:</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Be passionate about their work above all else. It's okay to mess up, but it's important to own it, grow, and be better for the future.</li><li>Be able to work across all aspects of the application, from database indexes, backend code, testing, frontend, deployment, mobile. If it needs to be done, then you should be capable of figuring it out.</li><li>Be capable of learning new things. The technology we use, the APIs we need to work with, most of the team may not have worked with these things. We don't expect anyone to come in with existing knowledge of everything, so we expect every team member to be capable and interested in learning, solving problems, and be capable of creating something wonderful.</li><li>Be capable of self-directed work. Find a problem, fix it. The team has priorities, you should know what they are and work to help get it done. You should never have to ask if it's worth fixing something or what's the next ticket you should grab is. If it's not obvious to you, then you're out of sync with the team.</li><li>Not be afraid to refactor. Sometimes code is shit and you just need to do it. We're working with a lot of crappy, legacy technologies.

<div><p><strong>The No-Bullshit-iest Way We Can Describe This Job In The Least Amount Of Words In A Run-On Sentence: </strong></p><p>We build a lot of different kinds of stuff for a lot of different kinds of folks (<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/work/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/work/</a>) at a shop that is big enough to bite off important, meaningful work and small enough to have fun doing it and we’re looking for an engineer who is equally at ease talking to clients, designers, producers, and developers about things like scope, resource allocation, solutions to engineering problems, creative ideas for how to build things, ways to articulate technical complexity to normal business humans...and occasionally...cut some code.</p><p><strong>Here’s What We Think You Probably Need to Be Successful At This Job: </strong></p><ul><li>Have agency experience, leading a development team spread across multiple projects and clients.</li><li>Hands on developer and leader</li><li>Are comfortable reviewing project specifications, collaborating with company leadership to develop project estimates and technical specs</li><li>Experienced in code reviews to adhere to best practices and internal standards, providing feedback and following up on remediation</li><li>You have an ear to the ground for new tech, whether it comes from hacker news or a programming subreddit, and a desire to dive in and try it out.</li><li>Experience in architecting and building bespoke custom WordPress themes using Advanced Custom Fields, Gravity Forms, Yoast with custom integrations to third party systems.</li><li>Experience in client and server-side debugging, performance profiling and optimization techniques with an uncanny intuition for finding the cause and solution</li><li>Experience with integration of analytics, a/b testing, and advertising platforms using Google Tag Manager</li><li>Planning out projects in coordination with Project Manager/Producer and Developer team members, participating in project check-ins providing feedback to the team</li><li>Jumping in to assist developers who are in need of aid in implementation and/or troubleshooting of backend or frontend development goals</li><li>Aiding and/or leading bug triage in coordination with Project Manager throughout project and during QA</li><li>Comfortable working with small projects (1 dev) and medium projects (2-3 devs)</li><li>Experienced in concepting high-level architectures and codifying them in visual and written documentation</li><li>Experienced with CI / CD build automation tools such as DeployBot, Jenkins, and Travis CI</li><li>Comfortable in architecting and implementation of APIs in PHP/Laravel, NodeJS/Express and other similar stacks.</li><li>Attention to detail and a seamless user experience. &nbsp;This means making the product look like the design and working with your team to make it smooth and perfect.</li><li>You have real-world experience with React. &nbsp;AngularJS knowledge might be transferable, but React is what we're looking for.</li><li>jQuery is &quot;nice to have&quot; but NOT necessary in your arsenal. &nbsp;You respect the finer points of the browser rendering pipeline and know when to 3D transform (and when NOT to). &nbsp;Oh, and calls to GetComputedStyle make you shudder, especially when jQuery is obfuscating them.</li><li>You do so much Wordpress that you have strongly-held opinions about its future, its architecture, and the &quot;right ways&quot; to build with WP. &nbsp;We keep our stack lean and don't go plugin-heavy.</li><li>You have strong opinions on, and respect for, the design process.</li><li>We mostly do a lot of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript -- we keep it lean and get the job done.</li><li>You know your way around configuring a local development environment with help from the Interwebz, of course.</li><li>You know what DevOps is but aren't necessarily a zealot for any one process, technology, or denomination.</li><li>You have a willingness to express yourself through animated gifs and obscure movie quotes from the youtubes.</li><li>You work well at the 11th hour, but even better at the first and second so we can be out by happy hour.</li><li>You're down with remote work. We've got offices in NY / LA but we encourage working from home, from coffee shops, from wherever you feel most comfortable. We've got tools in place to keep communication going online and we love that we can all be in different parts of the country and work together.</li><li>We constantly improve only because we don't bullshit each other or our clients. We don't hide; we don't say what we think others want to hear. We do our work with respect, and we value truth, transparency, and honesty above all else.</li></ul><p>To Apply:&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested, please apply with a resume and introduction.&nbsp;</p><p>Please feel free to skip the formality of a cover letter and write to&nbsp;me as a human being.&nbsp; If you need to use a four letter word to effectively express a previous engagement or an appropriately inappropriate metaphor to describe your ideal work environment, I’ll take that over what you would think I typically “need to hear” in a job application. Be yourself. The truth is the easiest thing to remember and I don’t have time to weed through cover-letter-speak to find out who you really are and what you want in life. Just tell me.</p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/192578?reset=False&amp;ra=12AfxD422agE&amp;oqs=a%3D12AfxD422agE' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                                <div>                                                    <a rel='nofollow'>Ask a question</a>                                                                                                        </div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Sanborn</h2>            <div><p>We're a 25-person interactive shop working with all manner of organizations (sports teams, beauty brands, magazines, non-profits, pharmaceutical companies, startups) helping to create and manage the full battery of digital media goodness (web, mobile, content, video and experiential activations to be specific).</p><p>We believe passionate, talented people all working together smoothly yields awesome work that lets us come back and do it again tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>Some more about where we stand as a company:&nbsp;<a href='https://sanbornagency.com/about/' rel='nofollow'>https://sanbornagency.com/about</a></p><p><strong>About Our Engineering Team:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>The team is made of folks who seem to enjoy bouncing in and out of different projects of different sizes with varying engineering challenges associated with them.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Our designers are highly technical and our engineers are very invested in the visual fidelity of their work - so some of the lines that typically divide UI/UX and engineering cultures don't really exist here.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>At any one given time we'll have folks on longer term missions (ie - 6 to 8 month long-term projects where we're in more of a product development posture) and people on shorter term campaign-based work where we're trying to explode a firecracker in the sky, measure how far and bright it travels, and then move onto to the next one.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>We try to keep plates of work varied and diversified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></li><li>Everyone is a grownup.&nbsp;</li></ul>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote work friendly environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Full health benefits package.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Los Angeles office locations.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Shithead eco-flush system ensuring shitheadless working environment.</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Family owned and operated.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

The experiences they publish work consistently across all browsers and devices, and all customer engagement is tracked with extensive analytics. All without writing code.</span></p><p><strong>About the Product</strong></p><p><span>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</span></p><p><span>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</span></p><p><span>We’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Chef, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</span></p><p><strong>About the Team</strong></p><p><span>As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.</span></p><p><span>We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself.

We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy.

As such, we strive for the user’s experience to be as smooth as possible. To achieve this, we need developers with a passion for web performance. We’re looking for people with experience profiling javascript applications and squeezing every last millisecond out of the code. We want somebody that is knowledgeable in web performance best practices and strives to make code faster.</span></p><p><span>Desired experience:</span></p><ul><li><span>Object-oriented programming</span></li><li><span>Image &amp; video asset optimization (Webp, Adaptive bitrate streaming, etc.)</span></li><li><span>Asset preloading </span></li><li><span>Efficient use of caches</span></li><li><span>Building performant web animations</span></li><li><span>HTTP/2 protocol to streamline loading</span></li><li><span>Impress us with anything else you have experience with!</span></li></ul><p><span>As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves:</span></p><ul><li><span>writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying),</span></li><li><span>having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,</span></li><li><span>carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,</span></li><li><span>agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,</span></li><li><span>collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,</span></li><li><span>and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p><span>If you’re interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us.

We have over two million registered users from around the world. Our primary product is an online, real time collaborative editor for papers, theses, technical reports and other documents written in the LaTeX markup language.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Who We Are</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf was founded by two mathematicians who were inspired by their own experiences in academia to create a better solution for scientific collaboration and communication. Now we are a team of thirty with about a dozen developers, based mainly in and around the UK and in the US.</div><div><br></div><div>About half of our development team joined us through our acquisition of ShareLaTeX, another major online LaTeX editor, last summer, and we've now integrated the two teams.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Our Tech</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf is based on open source software, and following our integration with ShareLaTeX, around 80% of our product code is itself open source. You can find it on GitHub:&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fsharelatex%2Fsharelatex' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/sharelatex/sharelatex</a></div><div><br></div><div>We currently have two overlapping tech stacks, one from Overleaf and one from ShareLaTeX. We are working on merging them together into &quot;Overleaf v2&quot;, which is now in public beta ( https://www.overleaf.com/help/342 ) and will launch in time for the fall academic term in September 2018.</div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf v1 has a Ruby on Rails backend using PostgreSQL and redis, hosted mainly on Heroku. We also have several node.js services that we've extracted from our rails monolith. On the frontend, recent development has been with React in ES6, bundled with webpack.</div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf v2 and ShareLaTeX run on a node.js backend using MongoDB and redis, hosted mainly on Linode and managed with Chef. Here we use a microservice architecture, with about a dozen services. Mainly our code is written in CoffeeScript, but new code is being written in ES6 where possible. On the frontend, we mainly use Angular v1, with some newer components being written with React.</div><div><br></div><div>We use Docker to manage our development environments, and our devops team is currently working on moving our production infrastructure to Kubernetes. We support continuous delivery and typically deploy at least a few times a day (less on Fridays).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How We Work</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Overleaf is remote-first — all founders and staff work remotely. We also have an office by King's Cross station for those in the London area, and we get the whole team together in London several times a year for face-to-face time.</div><div><br></div><div>We encourage flexible working. Our core hours are 2pm–5pm UK time, during which we have a 10–15 minute daily standup call for the whole development team. We have few standing meetings for developers, but we do many smaller video or voice calls for pairing or within project groups.</div><div><br></div><div>We don't yet have standing teams, but we form and dissolve smaller teams on a per-project basis; we try to give everyone the opportunity to serve as a team lead if they want to.</div><div><br></div><div>We always collect user feedback to inform our work. We have UX professionals on our team, and we run many surveys and user interviews.</div><div><br></div><div>We organize our work with Kanban. We use GitHub pull requests for each feature with code review to share knowledge and best practices (and catch bugs). We test thoroughly with automated unit and acceptance tests, supported by continuous integration (CI). We're also fans of linting to minimise bike-shedding (and to catch bugs).</div><div><br></div><div><strong>About This Role</strong></div><div><br></div><div>We plan to add up to three developers to our team, two with a backend focus and one with a frontend focus. Full stack developers are also very welcome to apply.</div><div><br></div><div>This year, you will work mainly on our integration projects — building out Overleaf v2. Here are some examples of projects (large and small) we've recently completed, to give you an idea of what you might work on:</div><div><br></div><ul><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F644-two-quick-updates-to-overleaf-v2-based-on-your-feedback' rel='nofollow'>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/644-two-quick-update...</a></li><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharelatex.com%2Fblog%2F2017%2F11%2F27%2Fintegration-update-link-sharing.html' rel='nofollow'>https://www.sharelatex.com/blog/2017/11/27/integra...</a></li><li><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F523-a-data-driven-approach-to-latex-autocomplete' rel='nofollow'>https://www.overleaf.com/blog/523-a-data-driven-ap...</a></li></ul><div><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overleaf.com%2Fblog%2F523-a-data-driven-approach-to-latex-autocomplete' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><br></div><div>Post-integration, we are planning projects around improved collaboration features for teams, improvements to our rich text mode, and more.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>How We Hire</strong></div><div><br></div><div>The stages in our hiring process are typically:</div><div><br></div><ol><li>We will aim to update you on the status of your application within one week from when we receive it.</li><li>We'll schedule a short video or voice call to discuss your application. This is a non-technical screening call, up to 30 minutes long, in which we get to know each other and assess whether there may be a good fit. In particular, we'll discuss logistics and your ambitions and expectations, and we may ask for clarifications on your application. This is also an opportunity for you to ask questions.</li><li>We'll schedule a more in-depth interview, which is typically two hours long. The first hour is discussion, and the second hour is technical. For the technical, you'll have the option of either completing a homework assignment, which requires about one hour of your time before the interview, or solving a problem in the interview, if you prefer. The problems are practical in nature (no fizz-buzz or reversing linked lists), and you can use Google, man pages, etc., and ask us questions.</li><li>We'll make an offer. We usually interview in batches, so there may be a short delay while we interview other candidates, but we will try to keep you informed throughout the process.</li></ol><div>If you have a deadline, please let us know in your application, and we will try to be accommodating.</div><div><br></div><div><b><span>Requirements</span><br></b></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>We require that you:</div><div><br></div><ul><li>have a minimum of 2–3 years of relevant experience (we aren't taking on more new graduates at the moment).<br></li><li>will work for us full time (or nearly full time).<br></li><li>will usually be available in our core hours, 2pm–5pm UK time.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>Experience with the technologies we use is always a bonus, but you don't need to know them all; your ability to learn is much more important to us.</div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span><b>Benefits</b></span></div><div><br></div><ul><li>Remote and flexible working.<br></li><li>Salary £40k<span>–</span>£75k per year depending on experience.<br></li><li>You would join a small, dedicated and growing team.<br></li><li>We're substantially (around 80%) open source, so your work will often be on open source code.<br></li><li>We're backed by Bethnal Green Ventures ( https://bethnalgreenventures.com/ ) and Digital Science ( https://www.digital-science.com/ ), through which we're part of a wider community of startups in science, health and ed-tech.<br></li><li>Our London office is shared with several other Digital Science companies, so there's lots of interesting people to meet, and clubs and sports activities outside of work.<br></li><li>You can pick your own equipment. MacBook Pro? Lenovo ThinkPad? Notebook and pen? However you like to work, we'll provide what you need.<br></li><li>We provide a training budget; many of our developers choose to attend relevant industry conferences or buy training materials.<br></li><li>We run a biweekly internal seminar series (show and tell) with short talks from staff about their work or personal projects, new technologies and techniques.</li></ul><div><br></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
