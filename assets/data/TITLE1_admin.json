Pixability's solution empowers advertisers to activate video at every stage in the consumer journey in order to deliver impactful business results.</p><p><strong>Our Award-Winning Culture</strong></p><p>Our team is at the heart of our culture. We value innovation, collaboration and curiosity, combined with a passion for getting things done. We strive to hire and develop the best and foster a culture of open communication and transparency. We are driven and hard-working, but also have fun along the way with weekly catered lunches and happy hours, team outings, and unlimited time-off.</p><p>We were named the global winner for Video Innovation in the 2017 Google Premier Partners Awards, and proud to be included in Boston Business Journal's Fast 50 awards (2018) and BostInno's list of Boston's Coolest Companies (2017), as well as named #497 on the Inc. 500 (2017).</p><p><strong>The Role</strong></p><p>Reporting to the DevOps Team Lead, you will be on point for continuous integration and delivery throughout all stages of the software development life cycle at Pixability.</p><p>You will optimize and streamline our build and deployment system, with the goal of creating safe, repeatable deployment tools and procedures that can be executed by QA. Working closely with Development and QA, you will identify requirements and ensure the right components, data, and supporting tools are available for engineers, from the point of feature branch development all the way through to production release.</p><p>This role requires a high level of organization, resourcefulness, creativity and collaboration. You will work to promote and build a &quot;DevOps Culture&quot; across the engineering team - a culture that emphasizes empowering teams and individual developers to be productive based on reusable patterns, tools and standards you will help design and build.</p><p><strong>Who You Are</strong></p><p>You love building and integrating systems, automating processes and continuously improving technical solutions. You take strong initiative and complete ownership of problems and solutions. You don't ask your leader <em>What</em> to do, you ask <em>Why</em> and offer solutions.</p><p>You thrive in a fast-paced environment but you care deeply about the quality of your work. You are obsessed with making sure that products of your work are doing well in production and serve the needs of others on the team. You proactively seek feedback from the users and stakeholders. You derive much of your energy from working with others. You bring positive attitude to work every day. You are passionate but you leave the ego outside. As the saying goes, you &quot;argue like you're right but listen like you're wrong.&quot;</p><p><strong>What You Bring to the Party</strong></p><ul><li>Minimum 4 years experience in a DevOps or Continuous Integration oriented role</li><li>Experience working with Jenkins (preferred) or another big mainstream CI platform such as Team City, Bamboo</li><li>Familiar with Docker and concepts behind containerization</li><li>Experience with Ansible a strong plus, experience with other configuration management frameworks such as Puppet or similar would be valuable as well</li><li>Basic Python Usage</li><li>Experience working with Amazon RDS, comfortable interacting with and querying data in MySQL or other DB Engine (ie PostGreSQL)</li><li>Proficient working with Git and its associated branching and development strategies.</li><li>Experience working in an AWS hosted environment</li></ul><p><strong>The Team</strong></p><p>Love for technology and data runs in our veins. We try to adhere to the best practices of Agile (see our Tech Blog posts on our Agile Morphing). Like clockwork, we conduct daily stand-ups, sprint review / demo meetings, and retrospectives. All our teams operate in either SCRUM or Kanban. We hate thrashing. We want to build things the right way. At the same time we are acutely aware of when need for experimentation or concept-proofing is required and implications of working in that mode at times. We collaborate very closely with both the Product Management team and the actual users of our software (both internal and external).</p><p>We believe in empowering engineers to come up with solutions (not just implement them). At the end of every sprint, ALL engineers demonstrate what they have built to the rest of the team, the Product Management team and other department stakeholders. Every quarter we show off the key features and systems we've built to the whole company. Our goal is to continue to innovate quickly while maintaining the highest levels of quality.</p><p><em>Pixability does not accept/pay fees for unsolicited resumes from third party agencies/vendors</em></p><p><strong>As part of our dedication to the diversity of our workforce, Pixability is committed to Equal Employment Opportunity without regard for race, ethnicity, gender, protected veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity or religion.</strong></p><ul><li>provided by Dice DevOps, Continuous Integration, Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, AWS </li></ul></div></div><div></div></div></div>"

We are currently building foundational tools for emerging business models in the cryptocurrency or Bitcoin 2.0 space. These tools will be packaged into separate ventures that are individually funded and skinned for different business niches.</p><p>ConsenSys is presently comprised of a number of core personnel — some of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development, acquisitions, investments, or the formation of joint ventures.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Remote</span>,

of whom are based in New York City, but several are in other cities around the world — who are focussed on the identification, acquisition, and development of talent and projects, in addition to the development of our own internal projects and some focus on consulting work.</p><p>ConsenSys spawns, coordinates, incubates and accelerates single purpose vehicles (SPVs) through internal development,

Our mission is to use these solutions to power the emerging economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet.</p><p>Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, security and infrastructure, and more. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us. </p><p>The role:</p><p>Are you looking for the next frontier and challenge where you can apply your expertise in penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, and threat modeling?  Smart contracts are programs on a blockchain: they never go down, cannot be changed, and run as programmed.  These smart contracts directly control money, so you can see that their security is critical.</p><p>ConsenSys is a development pioneer of the Ethereum ecosystem and many of our tools such as Truffle, INFURA, MetaMask, BlockApps, are among the most widely adopted globally.  With ConsenSys Enterprise, we have been delivering blockchain software solutions to major global institutions for the past two years.</p><p>ConsenSys is expanding its efforts on smart contract security to meet the needs of enterprise clients as well as home-grown platforms ranging from prediction markets to decentralized crowdfunding, including uPort, Gnosis, Stabl, WeiFund, and Virtue Poker.  Our aim is to build the most technically-gifted and engineering-focused blockchain security team.</p><p>We are looking to hire someone with a passion for Solidity, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and security.  Candidates should relish in technical subtleties and minutiae, and have a passion for combining them with a flair for creativity and insight to hack smart contracts.</p><p>A significant part of the work can be done remotely wherever you are; little travel is anticipated (most of the technical team works remotely around the world). There's also opportunity to stay ahead of demand and lead and build out this team in case that's also of interest. This will be an engineering-first development organization, with the autonomy to manage itself in a manner conducive to software development excellence. It will be rigorous, demanding and not for everyone. We are looking for exceptionally intellectual, bright and technically driven individuals. We will be addressing challenges that have not been encountered before while borrowing from patterns in previous software architectures.</p><p>Qualifications</p><p>Minimum qualifications:</p><p>1 year demonstrated expertise with Solidity, the EVM, and blockchain</p><p>3 years of relevant work experience.</p><p>BS degree in a relevant field or equivalent practical experience.</p><p>Coding/scripting experience in one or more general purpose languages.</p><p>Preferred qualification:</p><p>Demonstrated expertise and contributions towards smart contract security, EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals), or research.</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience analyzing the security of systems (penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, etc.).</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience, including experience in responding to security problems in target-rich environments, looking at security alerts, front-line analysis and response.</p><p>Programming experience in Python, C/C++, Java, or Go.</p><p>Advanced degree (MS, PhD) in relevant field is a plus.</p><p>Who We are, some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:</p><p>The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society. We believe that there is an opportunity to bring the remaining 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy and to radically transform our society for the enrichment of humankind.</p><p>A dynamic startup environment with runway. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization. At ConsenSys, the runway allows you to focus on what you do best without worrying about the runway.</p><p>Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new technologies, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</p><p>Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much work to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users. </p><p>ConsenSys was just named a Top 100 FinTech company by KPMG's 2016 Fintech Innovators report.</p></div></div><div><div>Compensation</div><div>$90K–$120K<br>0.01%–0.01%</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to ConsenSys</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/lightning/jobs/217817-lightning-protocol-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/lightning/jobs/217817-lightning-protocol-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Lightning Protocol Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/lightning/jobs/217817-lightning-protocol-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Lightning Labs</a></div><div>San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/getdock/jobs/321752-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/getdock/jobs/321752-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Blockchain Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/getdock/jobs/321752-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Dock</a></div><div>San Francisco, Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/0xproject/jobs/274577-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/0xproject/jobs/274577-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Blockchain Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/0xproject/jobs/274577-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>0x</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/tendermint/jobs/321761-senior-software-engineer-sdk?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/tendermint/jobs/321761-senior-software-engineer-sdk?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Senior Software Engineer, SDK</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/tendermint/jobs/321761-senior-software-engineer-sdk?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Tendermint</a></div><div>San Francisco, Berlin, Toronto</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/takipi/jobs/313445-solution-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/takipi/jobs/313445-solution-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Solution Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/takipi/jobs/313445-solution-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>OverOps</a></div><div>San Francisco, Atlanta, Washington DC</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/originprotocol/jobs/308390-blockchain-solidity-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/originprotocol/jobs/308390-blockchain-solidity-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Blockchain/Solidity Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/originprotocol/jobs/308390-blockchain-solidity-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Origin Protocol</a></div><div>San Francisco, Boulder</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/cryptokitties/jobs/319673-blockchain-scaling-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/cryptokitties/jobs/319673-blockchain-scaling-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Blockchain Scaling Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/cryptokitties/jobs/319673-blockchain-scaling-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>CryptoKitties</a></div><div>Vancouver</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/enigma-platform/jobs/304453-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/enigma-platform/jobs/304453-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Blockchain Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/enigma-platform/jobs/304453-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Enigma</a></div><div>Petach Tikva</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/nykaa-com/jobs/276079-security-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/nykaa-com/jobs/276079-security-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Security engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/nykaa-com/jobs/276079-security-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Nykaa.com</a></div><div>Gurgaon, Mumbai</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>What We're Building</h3></div><div><div><p>ConsenSys is a blockchain venture production studio building decentralized applications, mostly on Ethereum.

At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society.<br>-A dynamic startup environment. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization.<br>-Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new languages, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.<br>-Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is about 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much work to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users.

Our company fundamentally believes great minds achieve greatness when they are set free and are surrounded and challenged by their peers, which is clearly visible in our organization. At Elastic, we effectively don’t have a hierarchy to speak of. We feel that anyone needs to be in the position to comment on truly anything, regardless of his or her role within the company.</p><p>#LI-MC1</p><p>Targeted Locations: Boston, New York, Atlanta&nbsp;</p><p>Elastic is an Equal Employment employer committed to the principles of equal employment opportunity and affirmative action for all applicants and employees.

That said, client visits (mostly London, but sometimes further afield) will occasionally be necessary, and some client engagements will influence the hours you'll need to be available - but most are pretty flexible around this too.</p><p>As well as monthly co-working days (one in London, one in Manchester), we bring the whole team together every couple of months for planning sessions, hack days, and socialising. We try to ensure that our social time is balanced and inclusive: we'll sometimes play board games in the office instead of just defaulting to&nbsp;a visit to the pub (though we do that from time to time too!)</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>25 days holiday per year</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>High spec Macbook or Thinkpad</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Budget for conference attendance (incl. international travel)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Culture of inclusivity</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Group life protection &amp; critical illness cover scheme</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Mixture of on-site and remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Friendly colleagues, with a wealth of experience to share</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours to suit you</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Training and development opportunities</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

The most important thing about you is that you are curious and care deeply about building great products that affect people’s lives. You are excited about joining a startup with all the ups and downs that entails. You are transparent, reliable and considerate. You are excited about shipping quickly. You are excited about trying out the newest technologies. You are ready to work hard to further our mission.</p><p>Beyond this, our requirements are:</p><ul><li>A passion for making developers’ lives easier and happier</li><li>Thorough knowledge of CI/CD Tooling</li><li>Programming experience in Node.js</li><li>Comfortable with infrastructure as code and deployment to public clouds</li><li>Extensive experience in designing Unix/Linux system architecture</li><li>Deep expertise in deploying cloud solutions (AWS etc)</li><li>Solid experience with containerisation technologies (Docker, Kubernetes)</li><li>Experience with Terraform and other Hashicorp products.</li><li>Experience with production databases management and deployments</li><li>You live within GMT-5 and GMT+5.5 (from South America/Central US time to India, Pakistan and some of Russia) for us to be awake at the same time.</li></ul><p><strong>About us </strong></p><p>Aula is a communication platform for education. Think ‘Slack for education’: consumer tech on the front-end yet complex infrastructure on the back-end. We’ve built Aula because we believe digital learning infrastructure should encourage community and participation-based learning.</p><p>For students, this means less one-way communication from the teacher, more collaboration with fellow students (using integrations with tools like GitHub and <a href='https://codepen.io/' rel='nofollow'>codepen</a>) and easier access to student services like the welfare team - even if you’re commuting or are away from campus on a placement. We’ve recently raised a $4.2m seed round and some people think we’re <a href='https://www.techworld.com/picture-gallery/startups/edtech-startups-watch-3643555/' rel='nofollow'>worth watching out for</a>.</p><p><strong>Our team  </strong></p><p>We’re a bunch of people from all over the world (Denmark, Philippines, France, Albania, Georgia, Pakistan, Sweden, India, UK and US) that care deeply about making educational experiences more engaging. Our developers have previously lead teams that have built things like the Georgian version of Youtube (<a href='https://www.myvideo.ge/' rel='nofollow'>myvideo.ge</a> with 2.5 million monthly unique viewers) and a novel way to share and view 3D medical images (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2013.00085/full' rel='nofollow'>TissueStack</a>), so beyond focusing on creating a supportive and collaborative environment where features get shipped quickly, we also have quite a bit of experience.</p><p>You’ll be working closely with Oliver, our CTO, so we thought we’d <a href='https://cl.ly/2i0V3z453H2K' rel='nofollow'>put a face on him</a>.</p><p>We are backed by a world-class team of investors such as Project A, Nordic Makers (an angel group including Co-founders of Unity and Zendesk) and executives from LinkedIn and IBM.</p><p><strong>Our tech stack </strong></p><p>We only use the bleeding edge tools to build educational infrastructure of the 21st century. We’ve explained it in more detail in <a href='https://blog.aula.education/bringing-educational-infrastructure-into-the-21st-century-the-stack-be66b1a743c0' rel='nofollow'>this blog post</a>, but here’s a quick overview of what we’re building with:</p><ul><li>React (and React Native)</li><li>Microservices backends with Node.js and AWS</li><li>Docker</li><li>ES6/7 Javascript</li><li>Redux</li><li>Mongo, Redis and others dbs</li></ul><p>For DevOps in particular, you’ll be working with tools like</p><ul><li>Terraform (‘infrastructure as code’)</li><li>Multiple database types</li><li>General Javascript including Node.js</li><li>Docker</li><li>AWS</li><li>Our internal CLI</li></ul><p><strong>Working at Aula </strong></p><p>We think the most important variable in choosing a job is getting the chance to work on complex and important problems with friendly and curious people in a collaborative environment.</p><p>But beyond that, joining Aula also means</p><ul><li>A rare opportunity to build a DevOps setup from the ground up</li><li>Being part of a fast-paced and mission-driven startup made up of a creative, friendly and international team.</li><li>Plenty of responsibility, autonomy and encouragement to shape your own tasks and contribute original ideas.</li><li>A supportive environment with an intense focus on learning and improvement</li></ul><p>You’ll be doing pair programming, have one-on-ones where we speak about how to develop you both as a programmer and a leader, and occasionally jump on a video call and share a ‘remote meal’ while a team member speaks about a topic they care about. Once a month we also have ‘Mad Computer Science Idea’-day, where the entire team gets together to create something that has never been created before or using some tech that’s usually not used for that purpose.</p><p><strong>The role </strong></p><p>We’re looking for a seasoned developer that can take the lead on creating a fully automated DevOps setup to make our developer team really happy. &nbsp;</p><p>Here’s a snapshot of what you’ll be working on:</p><ul><li>Infrastructure deployment/management:</li><ul><li>Management of our current infrastructure.</li><li>Monitoring of our resources: dozens of network interfaces, hundreds of servers, dozens of databases, etc.</li><li>Deployment of new infrastructure resources (new institutional environments)</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Tooling</li><ul><li>Integrate all the automation around infrastructure/deployments into the Aula-CLI</li><li>Create new tools to ease other developers’ lives/deployments</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Deployment/test pipeline</li><ul><li>Create/maintain the right pipeline in order to ensure maximal automation around running our tests and deployments</li><li>Full CI/CD pipeline</li></ul></ul><p>We already use a number of solutions for automating repetitive and/or critical tasks. All our infrastructure is managed via Terraform, and we’ve built a custom CLI that automates deployments, automates parts of the development and allow for easy troubleshooting and local development.</p><p>A big part of the role is to continue building on top of those existing tools and to bring new ones that would fit our environment and needs.</p><p>2 main rules:</p><ul><li>Infrastructure as (reusable) code</li><li>Automate all the things!</li></ul><p><strong>Interview process </strong></p><p>Interview processes don’t need to be scary and stressful for us to be able to pick out those of you that would fit in the best at Aula. The first three stages all take place asynchronously in a dedicated Slack channel filled with other curious and smart candidates - it’s turned out to be <a href='https://cl.ly/1P1P2i0k1320' rel='nofollow'>quite a community</a>. You’ll chat with Oliver about your experience and your thoughts particular topics. You’ll then receive a (~5 hour) test to complete over the course of 48 hours - on the weekend if you’d like. Then you get to meet the team on video conference. If both parties feel comfortable, we’ll then give you an offer to join us. The whole process takes place over the course of around 10 days, in your own time.</p><p>We put a lot of effort into finding and developing the right team members and we prefer to spend our time on candidates that take the time to understand if they fit into the role. Please start your application with the words ‘I breathe semicolons’ to show that you took your time to read all of this </p><p>Look forward to hearing from you,</p><p>The Aula team </p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://aulaeducation.recruitee.com/o/devopsautomation-engineer' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Aula</h3>            <div><p>Aula is a communication platform for education.

At Combine we strive to leverage the range and depth of our teams when offering solutions to our customers.</p><p>As a member of our team you will contribute with your skills, personality and experiences and further enrich our capacity for offering solutions.</p><p><strong>Will I always have the same role in the team?</strong></p><p>In Combine we do not believe in sticking people in boxes and leaving them there forever. We also don't believe in silos. We believe that you are a person with dreams, hopes and career ambitions. Cross collaboration is always encouraged. Exposure to new experiences brings change and growth to your profile. As you grow more, you are encouraged to take new roles or dip your toes into new techniques and step further away from your comfort zone.</p><p><strong>Do you work on projects, or is it consultancy only?</strong></p><p>Sometimes you will work with customers at their premises, sometimes in-house, sometimes a mix.</p><p><strong>How specialized is the work at your company?</strong></p><p>For some projects you will need to have a laser-focus on hitting a target, while on other projects and especially when doing on-site work you will need to use the full range of your peripherals in order to find what is holding a customer back.</p><p><strong>How does a typical work week progress for your Team?</strong></p><p>No two weeks are the same for our engineering Team! The common denominator is that there will always be a purpose and a real need behind the tasks you have been given, as well as a focus on providing meaningful and reasonable proposals back to the customers.</p><p><strong>I like science fiction / volunteering / beer brewing / computer games / climbing / board games / 3d printing / hobby electronics / running triathlons / MMA / knitting / mountain biking / e-sports&nbsp; <br></strong></p><p>Cool!

Automattic is a place like no other: our fast-growing band of 750+ works as a distributed team across more than 60 countries, to democratize publishing and make the web a better place so that anyone with a story can tell it, regardless of income, gender, politics, language, or where they live in the world.</p><p>We are seeking talented wrangler of contracts, shares of stock, and the myriad details that we need to mind to keep the Automattic legal machine humming along.</p><p>As our first contracts and stock administrator, you will be part of a small legal team responsible for supporting all of Automattic’s growth. This is the ideal role for a candidate looking to expand beyond what is on offer in a traditional legal ops or paralegal position at a more moribund company. You’ll help invent processes and build systems from the ground up, not just run a dusty old machine built by someone else in the 1990s.</p><p>Some of your responsibilities will include: impeccably managing our cap table in Shareworks, helping to wrangle our flow of inbound agreements of all types as we build out our contract database, and contributing to quarterly investor reporting and annual audits. Everything at Automattic is done on a global scale and in an international context, and you will frequently be managing projects in non-US jurisdictions.</p><p><strong>We’d love to hear from you if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Have experience as an in-house stock admin or paralegal in a lean, fast-growing, fast-paced software, internet, or creative startup, large private company or at an investment fund.</li><li>Have exceptional interpersonal skills, including outstanding verbal and written skills in English.</li><li>Possess an agile and curious mind. You’re not afraid to ask questions or admit when you are wrong.</li><li>Have a healthy sense of humor, and an abiding spirit of idealism about your chosen profession.</li><li>Have a passion for elegant, simple, automated solutions that keep operations running smoothly, and an ability to see opportunities for process improvement and the initiative to move forward with action.</li><li>Thrive in a tech-centered, developer-focused environment, and are adept at collaborating with engineers and understanding technical and product details.</li><li>Love a dynamic, fast-growing environment.</li><li>Prefer operating very independently, and are highly motivated to learn new things and improve your skills, and enjoy juggling an array of tasks.</li><li>Are collaborative, and enjoy working with teams such as Engineering, Marketing, and Finance.</li><li>Excel at understanding complex topics and explaining them to others in clear, concise, terms.</li></ul><p>Bonus points if you have experience working on a distributed team, WordPress, software development, coding, or open source.</p><p>We’re serious about growing diversity in the tech industry. We want to build Automattic as an environment where people love their work and show respect and empathy to those with whom we interact. Diversity typically includes, but is not limited to, differences in race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, political and religious affiliation, socioeconomic background, cultural background, geographic location, disabilities and abilities, relationship status, veteran status, and age. To work on diversity means that we welcome these differences, and strive to increase the visibility of traditionally underrepresented groups.

If yes, please send a short email to<strong>&nbsp;jobs @ this domain&nbsp;</strong>telling us about yourself and&nbsp;<strong>attach a résumé</strong>. Let us know what you can contribute to the team.&nbsp;<strong>Include the title</strong>&nbsp;of the position you’re applying for and your name in the subject.</p><p>Proofread!

Over the last two years, our Health Services Office has worked directly with Justice Jones, CEO, on a training and professional development platform for our school employees. The company offered high quality, service and rates. Across the board, we have been pleased with their work, attention to detail, and management of our platform. Development and implementation of our school's first web-based Administration of Medication Training Course is a prime example of 24/7 Teach's concern for quality and attention to detail. 24/7 Teach helped design the platform including personalization and ease of access. The response rate and increased knowledge was incredible compared to previous trainings.In my opinion, it has been the knowledge and the creativity of 24/7 Teach that resulted in such impressive results. I strongly recommend the services of 24/7 Teach and look forward to working with the company on future training.Dr. Jasmin WhitfieldSidwell Friends SchoolWashington, DC</div><div><div><a

Over the last two years, our Health Services Office has worked directly with Justice Jones, CEO, on a training and professional development platform for our school employees. The company offered high quality, service and rates. Across the board, we have been pleased with their work, attention to detail, and management of our platform. Development and implementation of our school's first web-based Administration of Medication Training Course is a prime example of 24/7 Teach's concern for quality and attention to detail. 24/7 Teach helped design the platform including personalization and ease of access. The response rate and increased knowledge was incredible compared to previous trainings.In my opinion, it has been the knowledge and the creativity of 24/7 Teach that resulted in such impressive results. I strongly recommend the services of 24/7 Teach and look forward to working with the company on future training.Dr. Jasmin WhitfieldSidwell Friends SchoolWashington, DC</div><div><div><a
