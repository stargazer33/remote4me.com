More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1)&nbsp;<strong>Customized Credit-Improvement Tips</strong>: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2)&nbsp;<strong>Personalized Money-Saving Advice</strong>: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3)&nbsp;<strong>Wallet Surveillance</strong>: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/307734?reset=False&amp;ra=1FcFRCcSe2Hu&amp;oqs=a%3D1FcFRCcSe2Hu%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>            <h4>About Wallethub</h4>            <div><p>WalletHub helps all consumers reach top financial fitness by providing:<br><br>• Free credit scores and credit reports that are updated on a daily basis.<br><br>• Free 24/7 credit monitoring and personalized advice that will help you improve your credit and save money. <br><br>• More reviews on financial products, professionals and companies than any other website.<br><br>• An extensive education center coupled with the ability to ask financial experts your money-related questions for free .</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work visa sponsorship</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from home</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1)&nbsp;<strong>Customized Credit-Improvement Tips</strong>: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2)&nbsp;<strong>Personalized Money-Saving Advice</strong>: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3)&nbsp;<strong>Wallet Surveillance</strong>: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/305949?reset=False&amp;ra=1EByIsq28mxa&amp;oqs=a%3D1EByIsq28mxa%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>            <h4>About Wallethub</h4>            <div><p>WalletHub helps all consumers reach top financial fitness by providing:<br><br>• Free credit scores and credit reports that are updated on a daily basis.<br><br>• Free 24/7 credit monitoring and personalized advice that will help you improve your credit and save money. <br><br>• More reviews on financial products, professionals and companies than any other website.<br><br>• An extensive education center coupled with the ability to ask financial experts your money-related questions for free .</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work visa sponsorship</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from home</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We’re committed to&nbsp;diversity and inclusion, and our common goal is to democratize publishing so that anyone with a story can tell it, regardless of income, gender, politics, language, or where they live in the world.</p><p>We believe in Open Source&nbsp;and the vast majority of our work is available under the GPL.</p><p>We strive to live by the&nbsp;Automattic Creed: <a href='https://automattic.com/creed' rel='nofollow'>https://automattic.com/creed</a>.</p><p>Come&nbsp;work with us.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p><strong>Choose your own adventure</strong>&nbsp;· Everyone works from the location they choose. We’re spread out all over the world in more than 60 countries. We track about 70 percent of our projects on&nbsp;P2-themed&nbsp;WordPress.com blogs, 25 percent in private chat rooms, and the rest on Slack. Because of the geographic variance, we’re active 24/7. We care about the work you produce, not just the hours you put&nbsp;in.</p><p><strong>Coming on board</strong>&nbsp;· When you make it past the interview stage we’ll do a project together on contract, typically lasting between two to six weeks depending on how much time you can spend, to see how we work together (learn more about our&nbsp;global hiring guidelines). When you join full-time, you’ll do customer support for WordPress.com for your first two weeks and spend a week in support annually, for evermore, regardless of your position. We believe an early and ongoing connection with the people who use our products is irreplaceable. (If you’re applying for an engineering position, you can&nbsp;learn more about the process you can expect.)</p><p><strong>Meeting up</strong>&nbsp;· We get the whole company together once a year for seven days so that Automatticians can create bonds that influence them all year long. So far we’ve done Grand Meetups in San Francisco, California; La Paz, Mexico; Oracle, Arizona; Breckenridge, Colorado; Mont-Sainte-Anne, Québec; Seaside, Florida; Budapest, Hungary; San Diego, California; Santa Cruz, California;&nbsp;Park City, Utah; and Whistler, Canada.</p><p>In addition to our all-company Grand Meetup, teams meet for five to seven days to brainstorm team-level strategy and bond in locales ranging from Boulder to Buenos Aires, Las Vegas to Lisbon, Montréal to Mexico City, and Vienna to Vietnam. If you join our merry band, expect to travel three to four weeks per&nbsp;year.</p><p><strong>Diversity and Inclusion</strong>&nbsp;· In 2014 we started to work, as a company, on facilitating spaces for discussions about diversity at Automattic. And at the 2016 Grand Meetup with all of our employees across 50 countries, we decided to share with the rest of the world&nbsp;what we are doing about diversity and inclusion.</p><p><strong>What do we look for?&nbsp;</strong>· Automatticians are curious, driven, compassionate, tenacious, autonomous, friendly, independent, collaborative, communicative, supportive, self-motivated, and amazing with GIFs. We strive to live up to&nbsp;the Automattic Creed&nbsp;and we want to work with people who will do the same. Are you interested in making the web and the world a better place? Apply today.</p><p><strong>Our Development Process</strong></p><p><strong>Data-informed, user-driven&nbsp;·</strong>&nbsp;For every feature we launch, we gather metrics about its usage, interaction, and growth in addition to listening to the masses of feedback we get on our blog and through support channels. This helps us inform decisions about new features and enhancements. It’s not uncommon to launch a feature and then iterate immediately.</p><p><strong>Diversity &amp; Inclusion At Automattic</strong><br><br>We’re improving diversity in the tech industry. At Automattic, we want people to love their work and show respect and empathy to all. We welcome differences and strive to increase participation from traditionally underrepresented groups. Our D&amp;I committee involves Automatticians across the company and drives grassroots change. For example, this group has helped facilitate private online spaces for affiliated Automatticians to gather and helps run a monthly D&amp;I People Lab series for further learning. Diversity and Inclusion is a priority at Automattic, though our dedication influences far more than just Automatticians: We make our products freely available and translate our products into and offer customer support in numerous languages. We require unconscious bias training for our hiring teams and ensure our products are accessible across different bandwidths and devices.&nbsp;Read more about our dedication to&nbsp;diversity and inclusion:&nbsp;<a href='https://automattic.com/diversity-and-inclusion/' rel='nofollow'>https://automattic.com/diversity-and-inclusion</a></p>            </div>        ",

This wealth of performance data is made available to the public through Grafana dashboards and open datasets. We are looking to complement the team’s wide area of expertise with a person who has in-depth knowledge of system-level performance (Linux kernel, containers).</p><p>We strive to be the performance standard bearer in the Foundation and the Wikimedia community. We aim to be visible in the performance community and work to influence others and bring learnings to the team.</p><p>Wikipedia and its sister projects are themselves powered by Free and Open Source software with MediaWiki at their core, surrounded by an ecosystem of services in PHP, Node.js, and Python. The web traffic is served from geographically distributed caching clusters powered by Varnish and Apache Traffic Server.</p><p>If you find what we do interesting, and you are excited by improving the reliability and delivery of one of the Internet’s top 10 websites, you might be just the person we need.

But we&rsquo;re also a team of dedicated (self-proclaimed) nerds, tech is what we know and love. So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",

Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!\\n\\nYou’ll be joining our Infrastructure Team, responsible for keeping Olo’s food ordering and delivery systems up and running reliably and securely.\\n\\nOur DevOps-oriented team uses Infrastructure-as-Code with automation wherever possible. The system has many moving parts and frequent deployments.\\n\\nAny engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote!\\n\\nResponsibilities\\n\\n\\n* Administering Windows Server roles such as IIS, Active Directory, WSUS, and DNS.\\n\\n* Building virtual infrastructure in cloud platforms such as AWS.\\n\\n* Patching operating systems like Windows Server and Linux.\\n\\n* Patching third party tools and security related vulnerabilities.\\n\\n* Configuring Load Balancers, VPCs, and Security Groups.\\n\\n* Troubleshooting network latency including analyzing packet captures.\\n\\n* Proactively monitoring all systems for uptime and security.

Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded user interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded website and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.&nbsp;  </div> </div>",

We want to empower people and companies to do transformative things using data.&nbsp; As a company, we have almost doubled in size over the last 18 months and we’re not looking to slow down.</p><p>To support our growth, we are now looking for an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) to join our Tech Ops Team.

We would love to hear from you if the idea of programmatically controlling thousands of production environments excites you!</p><p><strong>The Opportunity:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our Private SaaS offering has grown significantly over the past year and we now orchestrate and monitor Snowplow event pipelines across more than 150 customer-owned AWS &amp; GCP sub-accounts.&nbsp; Each account has its own individualised and optimised stack and all are capable of processing many billions of events per month.</p><p>We are looking for another SRE to help us grow to managing 1,000 and then 10,000 AWS, GCP &amp; Azure accounts.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>We are now on the lookout for a DevOps Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.&nbsp;</p><p>As DevOps Engineer you will be responsible for ensuring that our different engineering teams have their needs covered when it comes to cross-cutting concerns such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD Pipelines.</p><p>Your deliverables will have a direct impact on the day-to-day work of all our engineers. You will help them reduce the time to market of the tasks and features they are working on. Whilst development and operational efficiency will be your primary goal, you should also have an eye for performant and resilient infrastructures.</p><p>Your responsibilities as DevOps Engineer at BlueLabs will include:</p><ul><li><p>Enable the different teams to deliver and operate their services on their own</p></li><li><p>Be a strong advocate for keeping all things automated and under version control</p></li><li><p>Provide DevOps and SRE expertise and best practices to all developers within the organisation</p></li><li><p>Work hand in hand with the Engineering Leads to execute the company's strategy and assist the development teams when it comes to topics such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD pipelines</p></li><li><p>Be the first point of contact when it comes to cross-cutting concerns, while ensuring that you do not become a single point of failure</p></li></ul><p>BlueLab’s Sports Betting platform consists of tens of microservices written in Elixir, Go and Scala. You are not required to have professional experience with either of these languages but being interested in them will be valued positively, since it will help you better understand the needs of our Engineering teams.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>The base compensation range for this role is €65k-90k annually, depending on your background and experience. It can be subject to an adjustment of up to 15% in either direction if the cost-of-living in your region is far above or below the European average.

Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We want to empower people and companies to do transformative things using data.&nbsp; As a company, we have almost doubled in size over the last 18 months and we’re not looking to slow down.</p><p>To support our growth, we are now looking for an SRE (Site Reliability Engineer) to join our Tech Ops Team.

We would love to hear from you if the idea of programmatically controlling thousands of production environments excites you!</p><p><strong>The Opportunity:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our Private SaaS offering has grown significantly over the past year and we now orchestrate and monitor Snowplow event pipelines across more than 150 customer-owned AWS &amp; GCP sub-accounts.&nbsp; Each account has its own individualised and optimised stack and all are capable of processing many billions of events per month.</p><p>We are looking for another SRE to help us grow to managing 1,000 and then 10,000 AWS, GCP &amp; Azure accounts.

If you have strong technical skills and a passion for all things compiler, then this role could be the one for you.\\n\\nAs a type-system engineer you'll work as part of the compiler team to design and implement Luna's new type system, including its underlying theory, type-checker, and inference engine. This wok is _intrinsic_ to Luna's evolution, and will provide you with the opportunity to collaborate with a world-class team of engineers, community managers, and business developers (with experience at Bloomberg, GitHub, PayPal, to name a few), making your mark on Luna's future.\\n\\nWhat You'll Do\\nAs a senior type-system engineer, you'll be working on the design and development of Luna's new type-system, in conjunction with the rest of the compiler team, to help support the language's evolution. This will involve:\\n\\n\\n* Determining and formalising the theoretical underpinnings of the new type system in a way as to ensure its soundness.\\n\\n* Both theoretical and practical treatments of the theory behind Luna's type system.\\n\\n* Working with the broader compiler team to implement the type-checking and type-inference engines as part of the greater interpreter.\\n\\n* Using the type-system's information to improve the interpreter's functionality and performance, as well as how it interacts with the users.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Skills We're Looking For\\nWe have a few particular skills that we're looking for in this role:\\n\\n\\n* Practical and rich experience writing code in a functional programming language such as Haskell or Scala, including experience with type-level programming techniques (3+ years).\\n\\n* Experience working with the theory behind powerful type systems, including row types, type-checking and type-inference algorithms, and dependently-typed systems.\\n\\n* Practical experience building real-world type-systems, including facilities for both type-checking and inference.\\n\\n* An awareness of the UX impacts of type-systems, and a willingness to minimise their often-intrusive nature.\\n\\n* Practical experience in building large and complex software systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt would be a big bonus if you had:\\n\\n\\n* Experience writing Java and Scala code, as these will be used to implement the type-system.\\n\\n* Experience in writing comprehensive regression tests for both type-inference and type-checking systems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAvoid the confidence gap. You don't have to match all of the skills above to apply!\\n\\nWho You'll Work With\\nYou'll be joining a distributed, multi-disciplinary team that includes people with skills spanning from compiler development to data-science. Though you'll have your area to work on, our internal culture is one of collaboration and communication, and input is always welcomed.\\n\\nWe firmly believe that only by working together, rather than putting our team members in their own boxes, can we create the best version of Luna that can be.\\n\\nThe Details\\nAs part of the Luna team you'd be able to work from anywhere, whether that be at home, or on the go! We have team members distributed across the world, from San Francisco, to London, to Kraków. We welcome remote work and flexible schedules, or you can work from the Kraków office (or our planned SF office) if you'd like. We can provide competitive compensation and holiday, as well as the possibility\\nof equity as time goes on.\\n\\nHow To Apply?\\nSend us an email at   <span>[email&nbsp;protected]</span>, and tell us a little bit about yourself and why you think you'd be a good fit for the role! You can also tell us about:\\n\\n\\n* Some of your past work or projects.\\n\\n* Why you'd like to work on Luna, and where you imagine Luna being in 5 years.\\n\\n* The most important features of a team that you'd like to work in.\\n\\n* Whether you take pride in your ability to communicate clearly and efficiently with your team.\\n\\n\\n  </div> </div>",
