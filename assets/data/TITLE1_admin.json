[Check out our jobs page for more on that](https://skyscrapers.eu/jobs).   <br>   <br>Note that we are looking in the timezones between UTC-4 and UTC+3 to keep things practical.   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> Depending on your specific skill set, passions and desires you’ll be tasked with a combination of any of the following:   <br>   <br>* Support developers in using the platforms we build and making the right decisions   <br>* Providing customers with expertise, guidance and engineering services (as part of ongoing commitments or consulting projects)   <br>* Setting up and maintaining platforms for customers   <br>* Ensure the operational availability, performance and efficiency of the various platforms we build   <br>* Researching, designing and implementing reference architectures and components based on the technologies we use (Kubernetes, serverless, open source)   <br>* Increase the automation of everything we do by codifying operational best practices   <br>* Participate in a (weekly) 24/7 rotation and some other non-24/7 shared roles   <br>* Occasional travel to meet colleagues, attend events and customers.   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>The expertise and skills we’re looking for:   <br>   <br>* Amazon Web Services architectures for modern web applications (EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, ECS, EKS, S3, etc) holds no secrets for you   <br>* You are a wizard of the clouds employing such spells as infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) and using versioning (GitHub)   <br>* Excellent Linux-fu skills (command line, tools, scripting, networking, etc)   <br>* Ops: troubleshooting and fixing running systems make you feel like a ninja   <br>* Captain of containers: you have hands-on experience with deploying and managing containers   <br>* Modern web-app workflows and architectures makes you warm inside: CI/CD, 12-factor app and containerisation   <br>   <br>The more fluffy things we like (aka soft skills):   <br>   <br>* Excellent communicator using English: well considered, constructive, clear, no-bullshit and transparent communication through text and voice. (don’t worry about your accent, we all have one ;-) )   <br>* Be able to cope with change and ambiguity. You better be ready for that as it is not only a reality in our company but also in the world around us.   <br>* Passionate about technology, cloud and devops: you can't stop learning and have a desire to continuously want to stay on the cutting edge.   <br>* You think independently and take responsibility for the overall success of the organisation and have the maturity to speak your mind in a constructive way.   <br>* You are utmost professional in all the work you do by taking responsibility and delivering quality work at all times.   <br>* Transparency in work and people don’t scare you so we all have the information we need to get things done, grow and support one another.   <br>* You are absolutely respectful of everything and everybody. We embrace diversity.   <br>* Being a teamplayer comes naturally to you. You enjoy participating fully in all team activities and don’t hesitate to support others when needed.   <br>* You strive for wholeness in everything you do, both professionally and personally.   <br>* Be a self-starter: without anybody telling you, you know what to do today, you know where to search for the information you need to learn/get things done and you are not afraid or too proud to ask for help because you can’t possibly know everything.   <br>* Customers (Developers, CTO’s, etc) don’t scare you. Speaking with them, helping them out, whatever technical level they may be at, is no problem for you.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- From UTC-4 to UTC+3   <br>  </div> </div>",

As one of Future’s Senior Site Reliability Engineers you’ll be coordinating a globally distributed team to achieve highly resilient, cost effective distributed service environments. You will be collaborating with our software development teams, key project stakeholders and vendors to ensure our technical delivery aligns with the business strategy.</p><p> You will ensure that all our services meet their availability objectives, and collaborate with the technology teams to build highly resilient services and workflows. An SRE role is similar to a DevOps Engineer role and emphasises our objective to maintain a robust and performant organisation from all aspects of its technical process from CI/CD patterns to routing traffic around failing regions.</p><p> This is a challenging role! You will be supporting our colleagues, ensuring maximum uptime for public services whilst keeping pace with industry trends and acting as a spokesperson for their best practice and adoption.</p><p> Some of your time will be spent on routine ‘Ops’ work such as managing on-call incidents, patching and security checks. When not working on operations tasks you will be working with the Technology teams to improve our service to meet service level objectives, improve service operability and delivering their product objectives.</p><p> To succeed in this role you will be a proficient software developer, with experience in networking, storage, containerisation, and Linux operating systems. This is a complex and ever-changing business so you will need to be able to attend to unfamiliar situations, logically identifying the key aspects to focus upon before working empirically to meet the objectives at hand.</p><p> <strong>Key role responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Respond to out of hours incidents as part of a shared rota</li><li>Take ownership of SRE projects and drive them forward</li><li>Be accountable for meeting Futures SLOs</li><li>Collaborate closely with development and project team mates to deliver on our shared goals</li><li>Implement, evolve and maintain runbooks, automation and documentation to improve working practices and system operation</li><li>Attend events, conferences and workshops to maintain awareness of industry trends and support their adoption within the organisation</li><li>Design, build and operate highly resilient, performant and observable infrastructure that serves the changing business objectives</li><li>Collaborate with third-party suppliers and customers where required to support business requirements</li></ul><p><strong>Department Summary</strong></p><p> The SRE position operates within the Technology &amp; Engineering department at Future. We provide the global digital infrastructure and support required to deliver a multitude of high traffic brand websites, ecommerce/content analysis systems, back-office services and advertising services.</p><p> The Engineering team has recently become globally distributed and is providing new challenges and opportunities to our operating model.</p><p> We frequently participate in hackdays, local meetups and larger conferences to ensure our skills are kept sharp and to work with different members of the team.</p><p><strong>What you will need to succeed</strong></p><p>Future’s operating infrastructure is very broad requiring an equally broad set of skills to support. As part of the SRE team you are not expected to be an expert in all fields but to recognise your own strengths and support the group. The principal systems we desire awareness of includes;</p><ul><li>Containerisation and orchestration, eg Kubernetes, Docker-Swarm</li><li>CI/CD practices and tooling such as Jenkins, Gitlab-CI, Spinnaker, ArgoCD</li><li>Observability at scale with tools such as Prometheus, Sensu, CloudWatch</li><li>On-prem and cloud hosting providers (eg XenServer, AWS)</li><li>Automation and Configuration Management tooling such as Ansible, Puppet, Chef, TerraForm</li><li>Development languages such as Python, Ruby or Golang </li></ul><p></p>                                                <div>                            <a href='https://www.jobg8.com/Traffic.aspx?RhEZzU3WQ81UiSFlGL7y3gt' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>                    </div>                                    </div>",

All the features we create and their quality is driven first and foremost by what benefits our patients the most.&nbsp; Along the way, we serve the system that delivers care through patient's providers and the healthcare payers. Everything derives from serving our patients.</p><p><strong>Secure, Reliable &amp; Flexible Data</strong></p><p>The features we build generate data. Some of it entirely unique to PeerWell. That data must be securely held, it must be reliably available, and&nbsp;be usable for innovation. We combine our patient data into populations so that we can discover and help predict the direction of patient outcomes, and thereby provide patients&nbsp;with information and guidance to aid their recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;So building secure, reliable, performative and flexible systems is always a focus.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong></p><p>We seek to make sure our products not only perform but provide an excellent experience along the way. There are many users we serve ranging from patients, to nurses, and doctors, and insurers, and others. We seek to produce defect free software to serve them all, whatever their roles are with respect to the patient.</p><p><strong>Innovation and Appropriate Problem Solving</strong></p><p>We are looking to improve a very large and complex healthcare system. Our approach is through innovations that provide better care, efficiency, and knowledge to all the players.&nbsp; To this end we have created some never seen before innovations using smart-phones alone in the past couple of years, and we aim to do more. For example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Joint Range of Motion</li><li>Exercise Compliance</li><li>in-home Hazard Detection</li></ul><p>Sometimes, we apply well-known solutions and at others when innovation is needed we create something new. The point is, we innovate where it matters and has impact on patients and on the players who serve them.</p><p><strong>Civil Engagement</strong></p><p>We work together, often in different timezones. We expect kind and conscientious engagement with each other. Communication is essential, and honesty key.&nbsp; We are a diverse group of people with a variety of values, and we make it safe for everyone to do their work and express themselves.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Fully Remote Company!

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p><p>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

We spend our time thinking about how to give a global workforce complete control of their own work life while automating the hundreds of thousands of man hours which would normally be required to manage people on this scale.</div><div><br></div><div>We do this using React &amp; Typescript on the frontend backed up by GraphQL servers, some written in Ruby and Rails and some in Elixir and Phoenix.</div><div><br></div><div>Businesses ranging from the largest high-street retailers to five star hotels and independent coffee boutiques rely on Catapult as their casual workforce. If you’ve spent time in a large UK city, you’ve probably been served by a Catapult waiter or sales assistant without even realising it!</div><div><br></div><div>We’re well funded by some amazing investors, our product is live in over 100 locations across the UK and we’ve recently launched in Berlin making us the first and only pan-european player in this space.</div><div><br></div><div>Our company values https://writing.joincatapult.com/our-values/ are really important to us and influence every facet of how we work together.</div><div><br></div><div>As our distributed product organisation grows, we're looking for somebody to help us improve our devops infrastructure and tooling, this includes:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Migrating our CI (gitlab) and feature branch deploys (GKE) to AWS</div><div><br></div><div>2. Upgrading our delivery pipeline for our mobile applications</div><div><br></div><div>3. Creating tooling and documentation to help engineers interact with our infrastructure</div><div><br></div><div>4. Helping us optimise our database infrastructure as we scale</div><div><br></div><div>And probably many other challenges we don't yet know about! You can read more about how we approach engineering with our engineering principles; https://writing.joincatapult.com/engineering-principles/</div><div><br></div><div>For now we're looking for someone to work with us on this 1-3 days a week, we're happy to be flexible on logistics, we could also work on a project basis. We're also flexible on direct employment v contracting depending on situation, location and structure.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About You</b></div><div><br></div><div>You've got deep experience working with AWS but are equally happy working on bare metal or with generic VPS providers like Linode or Digital Ocean. You're comfortable working with Ansible and Terraform and consider anything which isn't fully automated unfinished. You consider DevOps to be a first class value adding field rather than a support function and like to work closely with the rest of the product organisation.</div><div><br></div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more DevOps &amp; Sysadmin jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Snappy Kraken</span><br><span>Lead Software Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>USA</span></a></li><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Snappy Kraken</span><br><span>AWS Certified SysOps Administrator</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>USA</span></a></li><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Files.com</span><br><span>Senior Infrastructure Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>U.S.A.</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

And we do this working with some of the most progressive and well-known companies in the world. <br /><br />*Who we are:*<br /><br />Looop is a post-revenue, high-growth technology start-up, which means (in real language) we've done the really hard bit, turning a great idea into a business, and now we're growing the team to build on our initial success!<br /><br />Since 2014, we've been challenging the Learning & Development (L&D) industry to catch up with the way that technology enhances our daily lives: to ditch rubbish e-learning and keep out of the training room! By doing this, L&D can help everybody be better at their jobs and take on exciting new roles.<br /><br />Our customers are not just companies who pay us in exchange for tech. We build deep relationships with the brilliant people at ASOS, Amazon, Sky, Financial Times, and more, and they rely on us for thought-leading, practical support to get better results through their Learning & Development.<br /><br />As people, we are experts at what we do, driven to make a difference, and friends who like working with each other. We challenge and support each other to be the best we can be and celebrate the many successes we have along the way.<br /><br />*What you’ll be doing:*<br /><br />* You’ll be given lots of responsibility and exposure across various disciplines, including Marketing, Administration, Customer Contact, and ad-hoc projects.<br />* You’ll work directly with the Founders to help implement key strategic and commercial outcomes across the business. <br />* Building and optimising processes for scale in the areas of marketing, sales, customer success and business operations. <br /><br />*Experience:*<br /><br />* You need to have 2+ years of work experience, ideally with a tech company, startup or top-tier corporate. <br />* Exposure to HR is a bonus but not a must. <br />* You are able to break down complex problems into smaller ones and enjoy using data to inform your decisions.<br />* You must be a UK citizen or not require sponsorship to work in the UK.<br />* Have amazing writing skills.<br /><br />*Benefits:*<br /><br />* You’ll get to work in one of the most progressive learning tech companies in the world right now.<br />* You’ll have exposure and the chance to grow in all areas of our business.<br />* We’ll arm you with all of the latest tech equipment.<br />* Competitive salary.<br /><br />*Location:*<br /><br />Whilst you will have the opportunity to predominantly work from home, this role will involve working in teams at various sites including our customers across the UK, depending on where you're based.<br /><br />We’re growing fast and we move quick - so don’t delay!<br /><br />When you apply, please include a brief cover email outlining:<br /><br />* Why Looop?<br />* Something interesting about you<br />* Why now?<br /><br />We’ll start interviewing interesting candidates as soon as they apply and can make an offer just as fast. <br /><br />If all of the above sounds like just what you're looking for, please apply today.",

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p><p>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

    "content": "*Operations Manager*<br /><br />*TLDR: Do you love making stuff happen?*<br /><br />Hubbub is growing 100% year on year. We provide awesome fundraising technology for universities and charities. Fast growth can be tough on the joints that hold organisations together. We are now looking for someone with a passion for connecting the dots, making processes, systems, data, and people work together to deliver amazing results.<br /><br />We anticipate that you may have an unconventional career path. Great operations people are problem-solvers, thinkers, do-ers, fantastic communicators, not afraid to get their hands dirty but with a clear vision for overall direction and the insight for what change is going to matter. Value alignment, culture fit, and being able to showcase your skills - these are the things we’ll be looking for.<br /><br />*A bit more about the role*<br /><br />We have a lot of data, a solid finance function, a fair few disparate systems across Commercial, Technology & Product, and Customer Success teams, and a desire to join up, improve, automate (to catch up a little with the growth we’ve had), and prepare for the rapid growth that is yet to come.<br /><br />You’ll need to be confident and able managing a finance function - primarily in terms of processes, controls, data and metrics reporting. The finance layer underneath you works well, and data is accurate and relatively easy to access. But our financial data does not surface the insight we want right now - either to the company’s leadership, or to the business units that need it to inform their work. Overall responsibility for ensuring various important financey things are done on time sits with the company’s founders, and we’d like you to bridge this gap. In addition, we’d like you to extract and analyse the financial data so we can iterate processes and improve the information available for strategic decisions we need to take.<br /><br />The same pattern around data and insight exists elsewhere. There’s plenty of solid systems and processes - and reliable data - in our Technology, Customer Success, and Commercial functions. But we need to join these sources of insight and information up so that we can feed back the information into the teams that need it. Which product line is producing the best ROI for clients? How does it vary by country? What are the implications of this for our Marketing and Product teams? We can generate all this right now, but we’d like someone working ahead so that the actionable insights that matter to the business come to us before they become a problem for us to solve. In short: we want dashboards - not lots of them, but really good ones, that tell us in real-time what is working and what isn’t.<br /><br />We often have one-off projects that cross operations, finance and fundraising - such as managing the roll-out of options schemes, or closing the paperwork for an investment round. We’d like you to project manage these one-off larger projects, working with senior internal leaders (yes, this means telling them what to do, when, in some cases) as well as outsourced legal and accounting teams (creating plans to ensure outsourced work is done to a high standard on-time!). This doesn’t mean you need to be an expert in any particular area (though obviously a basic understanding of finance, investment and legal areas is useful) - it means you need to understand where the critical path is, be able to analyse the pieces of the puzzle, and put them together in the right order. You’ll always be well-supported if you’re unsure of next steps. <br /><br />We have a top-level annual growth plans and initiatives to deliver them that cover the period until end 2022. We also have operational plans in our Commercial, Technology and Customer Success functions that run to shorter timeframes. We need you to help bridge the gaps between these plans, sitting with business unit leaders both individually and as a group and creating and maintaining a mid-term operational plan that tracks interdependencies in key areas. That sounds quite jargon-loaded, so in simple terms, if the commercial team is proposing to generate £1m from a new product area in 2021, ensuring that the roadmap through 2019 and 2020 for technology is going to get the product ready, and ensuring that the customer success team have the materials and training to successfully deliver this product at scale. It’s not horribly complicated, but it does need regular attention to ensure risks and slippages are tracked and communicated.<br /><br />Finally, as a business grows it needs to constantly iterate tools, systems and processes - where to store key company information, how-tos, technical docs, what systems to manage information, contracts, CRM, project management, product roadmap, etc - as well as defining who is responsible for the set up, configuration and maintenance of these systems. We’d like you to come in and help us rationalise our software and subscription systems to ensure we are both purchasing and using efficiently the right combination of tools to meet our needs.<br /><br />It’s probably worth saying right now that if there’s a good fit and great delivery in this role, we’ll be looking to promote you within the first year. This role can only grow, and if you’d like to grow with it, that’d be fab.<br /><br />About you<br /><br />It’s likely you have a strong ability in finance, some history with legal/contracts, an obsession with establishing, measuring, iterating and improving processes, and strong communication skills. If you have startup experience or fast growth experience that’s likely to help - especially if it was in an operations or finance role. <br /><br />*About us*<br /><br />We are a 50% London, 50% remote team. We operate with weekly OKR meetings against quarterly objectives, with weekly all-hands meetings - and the whole team gets together twice a year. There’s a dog in the office most of the time. She’s cute. Our people are giving of their time, energy and attention, we take our ability to have fun seriously, and we have an awful lot of grit.<br /><br />*Reporting to/Based in*<br /><br />You’ll be reporting to the COO, who is a founder, joining all the all company meetings, and also our senior coordination group. On a day to day basis, you’ll be working actively with the leaders of the Technology & Product, Commercial, and Customer Success functions, in addition to the CEO, COO, and leading the finance team.<br /><br />We anticipate that you’ll be based in our offices on Old Street, London. We’re open to flexible working both in location and times, but for this role, we don’t think a fully remote hire is going to deliver what’s needed.<br /><br /><br />To apply, please send your CV to talent@hubbub.net with brief answers to the following:<br /><br />* Why do you want the role?<br />* Describe your relevant experience and past performance.<br />* What type of work environment brings the best out of you?",

We do this using a combination of human stylists and powerful machine learning algorithms to recommend each guy the perfect things just for them—in their size, budget, and style—which they can then buy in one place.<br /><br /><br />*Operations at Thread*<br /><br />Making it easy to dress well - and building a business around it - requires operational excellence. Our goal is to create a seamless end-to-end experience, from discovering the perfect item to having it delivered quickly and easily to a place of your choice. Our operations team is critical to this goal, focused on providing our users with an amazing post-purchase experience. We’re looking for an outstanding ops associate with strong administrative skills to help us continue to improve. You will be an important part of this small, dynamic and friendly team. Your role will be fast paced and varied but you’ll execute tasks in a way that makes things seem effortless for our users. If you are highly organised, fast paced, reliable, resilient and keen, this role could be for you. <br /><br /><br />*The role*<br /><br />Your role will be split across two areas of responsibility. Firstly, you’ll be responsible for placing orders with our third party suppliers, making sure that the orders are accurate and sent before the appropriate cut-off time. Secondly, you’ll be the first point of contact for customers with queries about Thread. You’ll either investigate and resolve these queries, or escalate them to a senior team member where appropriate. <br /><br />After initial training sessions in our office in Aldgate, you’ll be able to work remotely most of the time. We might ask you to come to our office occasionally for training sessions. The role guarantees a minimum of 6 hours a week (spread across morning, day and evening shifts on weekdays and weekends), with frequent opportunities to pick up more hours on top of that. We’re happy to negotiate the hours and shift times in line with our requirements. We’re currently particularly keen for someone who has the flexibility to do a shift or two on weekends, if possible!<br /><br /><br />*Your core responsibilities will include...*<br /><br />- First point of contact for our users - field all queries coming through to our support ticketing system and decide on the best pathway for each.<br /><br />- Resolve queries and issues efficiently and to a high standard. Make sure our users come away feeling like they had a mindblowing customer experience.<br /><br />- Contribute towards hitting our support response time and customer satisfaction targets.<br /><br />- Own resolving tickets regarding fulfilment problems, technical issues, feedback and more.<br /><br />- Identify and escalate issues to other teams within the company, including senior ops associates, styling, product and engineering.<br /><br />-Advocate for users internally by passing on their feedback and pain-points to the wider team.<br /><br />- Ensure the smooth running of our “just in time” fulfilment process by placing orders with suppliers in line with cut-off times.<br /><br />- Own hitting our buying cut-off targets, and contribute directly to our shipping time targets.<br /><br /><br />*Are you the one? You are, if you...*<br /><br />- Possess a collaborative “whatever it takes” attitude; be someone who won’t give up until a problem is fixed and who’s not afraid to push and lead others to a resolution.<br /><br />- Excel at finding ways to get around a problem; at times you won’t have the answer you need straight away and will need to think on your feet.<br /><br />- Have superb attention to detail; nothing gets past you.<br /><br />- Constantly think about how we can improve our processes; never be satisfied with a process that isn’t perfect.<br /><br />- Have excellent organisational skills. You make great notes and leave a clear path for others to follow.<br /><br />- Are known for being reliable to your core. Your friends and previous employers would describe you as totally dependable.<br /><br />- Possess exceptional communication skills, being both professional and effective over email.<br /><br />- Are comfortable working across different platforms and channels of communication. You don’t have to be a computer pro, but you’re confident jumping from the support dashboard to the buying page, from your email to a spreadsheet.<br /><br /><br />*Benefits*<br /><br />- This is a flexible role in which you’re welcome to work remotely for most of your hours.<br /><br />- You’ll be working closely with the core ops team and will be involved in the smooth running of our support and buying shifts.<br /><br />- You’ll get first-hand experience of the day to day workings of the operations team in a tech start-up.<br /><br />- Competitive compensation: £10/hour, plus holiday and sick pay.",

    "content": "<span><h2>Operations Manager&nbsp;</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>Ghost</h3></span> <span>Worldwide</span> <span></span> <span>verified</span> <div>  <div>   In the early days, everyone did everything. Then as we started to hire a few people, all the extra jobs outside of &quot;regular work&quot; - fell to our CEO, John. Now, as the company has grown a lot further, John is spread pretty thin and needs help managing and organising the logistics of running a remote company. That's what this role is all about!   <br>   <br>The Operations Manager role is a diverse one. At a regular company this might be referred to as something like &quot;Office Manager&quot; — but as a remote company, we don't actually have an office. Instead, we've got a different set of challenges which are reasonably unique to the type of business we've built.   <br>   <br>Primarily, the Operations Manager role has two core focuses: Organising team logistics to make Ghost a great place to work, and assisting John directly by helping to fill gaps in the company wherever things need doing.   <br>   <br>That said, this is a startup, so you should expect your role to extend to various parts of the business, as well as experiments and adhoc projects long the way. We're still a small team, so you'll be able to see - and contribute to - every part of the business from top to bottom.   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> *  Help to hire + onboard new employees, measure and improve team happiness, implement policies (PTO, parental leave, etc.), and administer payroll, benefits, and reimburse expenses.   <br>* ✈️ Research, organise, book, and project-manage our 9-day international team retreats every 6 months: Arranging everything from travel and accommodation, to daily schedules and supplies.   <br>* ❤️ Plan and implement useful systems and activities to help everyone stay organised, and foster camaraderie between our remote team mates.   <br>*  Handle accounts receivable/payable and help teams with various administrative tasks.   <br>* ⚖️ Be responsible for efficient meetings, workflows, documentation, and support for new tools we implement in the company.   <br>*  Do some customer support and assist our users directly whenever there are gaps in our global support cover which need extra help.   <br>*  Be the go-to person for questions from the Ghost Team regarding company policies and procedures.   <br>*  Assist John directly (and occasionally other team members) to allow them to be more productive, and better manage their time + workload.   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>**Obsessively organised.**&nbsp;This is the heart of the whole job, so we're on the lookout for someone who is already fantastic at organisation - and will be able to raise the bar of our overall organisational competence.   <br>   <br>**A creative problem solver.**&nbsp;Someone who can get things done even when there's no immediately obvious answer or process for how to do them - and is happy to take responsibility for delivering.   <br>   <br>**A people person.**&nbsp;This is definitely a role suited to a broadly extrovert / ENFJ type personality. You need to be great at understanding our team members, what motivates them, and what makes them tick. Empathy++   <br>   <br>**A great writer.**&nbsp;Not only does this role involve a lot of writing, but as a remote team writing is our primary form of communication. Clear, concise communication in native English is an absolute must for this role.   <br>   <br>**Tech savvy.**&nbsp;Ghost is a software company and, while this role doesn't require any specific technical or coding skills, it does require someone who is proficient and comfortable within that environment. We speak tech, and we work on tech, so it's heavily reflected in everything we do - and the tools that we use.   <br>   <br>**Independent.**&nbsp;You'll have quick team meetings each week as well as regular 1:1s with your manager, but beyond that it's up to you to get things done. All teams at Ghost operate autonomously, so you'll be expected to get things done without being directed. A background in contracting or freelancing can be a big help.   <br>   <br>This role would be particularly suited to someone with a background as an Executive Assistant who is looking to take on a broader role with more autonomy and independence, working remotely from anywhere in the world. It would also be very suited to digital nomads looking for a meaningful long-term role which can travel with them.   <br>   <br>We don't mind where you're based or what hours you work, but this role does require a bit of schedule-flexibility, as you'll need some working hours overlap with John at all times, and he tends to move around quite a bit.   <br>   <br>We value diversity of all types at Ghost and our team is made up of a kind, thoughtful group of people with a wide range of backgrounds. We have as many people who speak German as we do English and our engineering team contains as many women as it does men. Some of us are single, others are married, while others are parents. We actively try to find people with different perspectives and experiences to the ones we already have.   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- Worldwide   <br>  </div> </div>",

The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p><p>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume. If we believe that you will be a good match, we'll contact you to arrange the next steps.

We believe in change through accountability, debate, ambition and respect for the communities and individuals that make up our networked universe(s).&nbsp;</p><p>Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to control a large group of people from the top down, which is why military organizations, industrial corporations and nation-states have relied on it so heavily. But hierarchies carry their own institutional costs, which means that a regulatory bureaucracy can focus only on a few issues at a time – generally those most important to the people at the top or to the dominant groups in the ruling coalition.</p><p>But what if we can organize this company to embody the very structures of those network communication technologies and digital platforms we hope to build? What if this can enable us to take on all those dinosaur hierarchies as equals - and more than equals? What if self-regulation and social cooperation can be amplified and intensified in this way to empower all of us to care for our selves and ourselves without any authority?</p><p>That’s why Mav Farm is&nbsp;stigmergic. Like the products we build, stigmergy is a form of self-organization social network. It's the principle that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergic networks are superior to hierarchies, in that they are not slowed down by bureaucratic permission-seeking, communication asymmetries and problems associated with top-down coordination. Instead stigmergy allows individual contributors or cells to freely work within a shared platform, contributing to a shared goal as they see fit.</p><p>With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project. The innovations of individual contributors can freely travel throughout the chain when others wish to adopt them. Think of stigmergy as a heuristic approach to improving everything, allowing all of us to be agile and flexible.</p><p>This is our shorthand way of saying that we don’t have any management, and nobody “reports to” anybody else. We do have Founders, but even they aren't your manager. This company is yours to steer—toward opportunities and away from risks, toward high performance and quick creative fixes. You have the power to green-light projects. You have the power to ship products.</p><p>In this stigmergic structure every organizational barrier is removed between your work and the customer enjoying that work. Every company will tell you that “the customer is boss,” but here that statement has weight. There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what our customers want, and then giving it to them.</p><p>So far, our team has designed, architected and built things like: motion tracking in video, object recognition in video, machine learning recommender systems, real-time graphics shaders, AR shopping experiences, business intelligence dashboards, marketplace apps, video streaming apps and more. Our sights are set high!

We’re a European VC-Backed startup with a host of blue-chip Enterprise clients and a string of awards and grants (including €2m from the EU Horizon 2020 program).</p><p>Platform.sh is built on top of open source languages, libraries and projects. But we never shy away from writing code.

You should have at least 5 years of professional experience and be able to point to a track record of caring about production systems with significant usage.</li><li>Feel at home with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Linux and shell scripting. You have been working in current cloud-based environments (such as AWS or GCP), but you don’t feel tied to one platform and generally appreciate picking the “right tool for the job.”</li><li>Like to learn and strive to do so often. As a company we improve to the extent that our team does. It starts with each individual.

Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D.

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p><p>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

Our first product streamlines recruiting scheduling and coordination, saving teams hundreds of hours a month. We’re just getting started on, and have our sights set on making hiring a great experience for recruiters, hiring managers, and candidates. We’re building the platform to engage these key stakeholders and fix the $200 billion per year hiring industry.</p><p>This is an exceptional opportunity to join a small and fast-growing startup, transforming an industry with powerful and easy to use products customers love. As an early employee you’ll have tons of ownership, a big impact on product, a say in our values, and opportunities to tremendously accelerate your career growth.</p><p>We’re building a remote team and looking for the best individuals – no matter where you are. All we require is a reliable internet connection and passion for building an amazing company.</p><p></p><strong>What We’re Looking For</strong><p>Building products isn’t just about engineering – it’s about solving real world problems. What you build is more important to you than the technical challenge. You’re product minded and have user empathy. You’re an engineer at heart, but have explored product management or design in the past. You understand the importance of elegant design and powerful UI / UX. You want to build something people want.</p><p>You can code the full stack and have built web apps end to end. Front end is where you shine, but you’re not afraid to dive into backends when needed. You can whip up UIs in no time. You have an intuition for elegant designs, but recognize there’s no replacement for user testing. If you don’t know something, you learn what’s needed to get the job done.</p><p>We use JavaScript (React), Python (Flask), and SQL (PostgreSQL). We’re hosted on AWS. Having these skills is great, but we know the best engineers can pick them up quickly when needed.</p><p></p><strong>What We Value</strong><p>At Interview Schedule we believe in ownership and accountability, challenging the status quo, nothing is “not my job”, having empathy, being direct, and being honest.</p><p>As engineers we believe in picking the right tool for the job, balancing technical excellence with pragmatism, having strong opinions weakly held, and attacking ideas not people.</p><p></p><strong>What We Offer</strong><ul></ul><li>Autonomy, impact, and ownership. As an early employee you’ll shape the product direction and company values.</li><li>Competitive salary and significant equity in a fast growing, early stage startup.</li><li>Remote employment – work where you want, when you want.</li><li>Generous vacation policy – take time whenever you need to recharge. Building a lasting company is a marathon, not a sprint.</li><li>Top-notch healthcare, dental, and vision coverage.</li><li>Life and disability insurance.</li><li>Annual company retreat – helps build camaraderie as a remote team.</li><li>Computer and home office setup – we’ll buy anything you need to do your best work.</li><li>Continuing education allowance – learn what you want, when you want.</li><div> <a href='https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/interviewschedulecom/view/P_AAAAAAIAAFWEhgr3xM1GV6?trackingTag=jobspresso' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a></div>",

If you’ve got a flair for design, marketing, data analysis, etc. we can definitely make great use of it.  Get in touch, and let’s have a chat.<br /><br />Salary: £25k.

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in.

We process payments, run marketplaces, detect fraud, help entrepreneurs start an internet business from anywhere in the world, build world-class developer-friendly APIs, and more. If you’re an infrastructure engineer here, you’ll get to build the systems that power our products.   <br>Stripe doesn’t process quite as many requests as Twitter or Facebook, but we do care a very great deal about reliability. Every request we process is very important to everyone involved! We can’t go down because our users’ businesses depend on us.   <br>   <br>You’ll be on a team that maintains a product we provide to the rest of engineering, like storage or message queueing. You’ll make decisions with a significant impact on Stripe. There is a lot of work to do to make Stripe engineers’ work easier and our platform even more reliable than it is today, and we’d love for you to be part of it. We’re close to the people using our systems, so we constantly get feedback that we can use to make them better.   <br>   <br>We have a few dozen infrastructure engineers today spread across several different teams, and you’ll work with other infrastructure engineers as well as product engineers who use the systems you’re building.   <br>   <br>We’re looking for people with a strong background (or interest!) in systems. We’d love to hear from you whether you’re a seasoned systems developer, or whether you’ve just learned you might like working with databases. Many of our infrastructure engineers work remotely, and we’d be happy to talk to you about the possibility of working remote.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> **You will:**   <br>* Design, build, and maintain the core infrastructure used by all of Stripe’s engineering teams   <br>* Debug production issues across services and levels of the stack   <br>* Plan for the growth of Stripe’s infrastructure   <br>* Build a great customer experience for people using your infrastructure   <br>* To get a concrete idea of what projects you might work on here, see the “Projects you could work on” section.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>**We’re looking for someone who has:**   <br>* Think about systems — their edge cases, failure modes, and lifecycles   <br>* Know your way around a Unix shell   <br>* Can debug complex problems across the whole stack   <br>* Focus on the needs of our users, both internal and external   <br>* Hold yourself and others to a high bar when working with production   <br>* Are able to write high quality code in a programming language (e.g. Ruby, Scala, Go).   <br>* It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t come in with as much systems knowledge.   <br>   <br>**Projects you could work on:**   <br>We have a ton of important work to do, which is why we’re hiring! Our projects are of course changing all the time, but here are a few projects either that we’ve done in the past, so you can get an idea of the types of work we do. Technologies we use include: haproxy, nginx, consul, jenkins, datadog, statsd, kafka, rabbitmq, storm, and others.   <br>   <br>* Plan and implement multi-region availability for our distributed job queuing infrastructure! All of our systems can sustain losing machines, and making our systems even more resistant to failure is a big theme for us. If you like thinking about distributed systems, you might find a good home here!   <br>* Write easy-to-use and reliable client libraries for our Kafka or database systems. You’ll write abstractions and provide reasonable defaults around timeouts and error handling for a complex system.   <br>* Move us to a region with no downtime. Last year, we needed to migrate AWS regions, and we pulled it off with no negative effects on our users and no downtime.   <br>* Request tracing! Your mission: make it easier for any Stripe engineer, when debugging, to trace a request from its source down to every service it touched.   <br>* Build fantastic code review tools! If you love helping developers be more effective at their jobs, we have a ton of interesting projects in this area. Related projects: you could help us have better reproducible builds with Bazel and build great developer environments.   <br>* We have a bunch of projects around deploying and running code: help us instantly roll back bad deploys so that we can recover quickly, and build infrastructure that lets us scale up our API workers in seconds in response to high API load.   <br>* We need to scale our databases to handle 10x the load they can today. You could help us shard them more effectively, upgrade our database engines, and build great tools for developers so they can understand their slow queries more easily. A lot of our database projects are open source.   <br>*  </div> </div>",

Recently we’ve launched Stack Overflow for Enterprise and Stack Overflow for Teams, allowing organizations to have a private experience on the platform they already know and love.

Recently we’ve launched Stack Overflow for Enterprise and Stack Overflow for Teams, allowing organizations to have a private experience on the platform they already know and love. The success of these new products requires us to rethink our infrastructure strategy for supporting on-prem, cloud, and remote deployments.   <br>   <br>We’re looking for someone with Linux and Windows Server experience (3+ years).

We are wiki-centric and prefer to document and automate in small increments as we work.   <br>   <br>We are a remote-first team with members in many timezones.

One of WIRED’s hottest European startups, winners of a tech competition backed by Richard Branson and backed by the prestigious Index Ventures.</p><p>This is a multi-award winning Shoreditch based tech company, a startup that has scaled up successfully and whilst it is now fairly well established (around 50 strong), still retains the feel of a startup and continues to go from strength to strength.</p><p>There are challenges facing the infrastructure team. These are all the right kind of challenges though – all to do with growth and having to scale up the infrastructure to cope with burgeoning demand from an ever-increasing customer base.</p><p>There is therefore a huge amount of greenfield projects for you to get your teeth into. We’re talking about moving away from monoliths towards microservices infrastructure based on Kubernetes. We’re talking about building and automating completely new production environments and working with varied &amp; interesting tech such as Kubernetes, Docker, AWS, Terraform, Ansible.</p><p>You will be part of a drive to transform the way in which their development team build and deploy software. You will also be valued member of a DevOps centre of excellence, sharing in their enthusiasm for open source tech (and being active in the open source community at large such as going to conferences and contributing to projects) and championing DevOps culture and best practice. </p><p><strong>What the tech looks like:</strong> Linux servers, Ruby, Puppet, Linux, php, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Microservices, Terraform, Chef, MongoDB, Python, NodeJs, Go, Hashicorp, Infrastructure as code, continuous integration, continuous delivery </p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li>Meaningful share in the business.</li><li>Health insurance</li><li>Competitive pension scheme</li><li>Generous holiday allowance (30 days NOT including bank holidays)</li><li>Flexible working / working from home</li><li>Extremely strong professional development ethos – investing massively in training and development. Every individual has a budget for conferences, training, courses etc…</li><li>Work with some of the best in the industry</li><li>Nice working environment – Cool, modern office in Shoreditch</li><li>Free lunch every day cooked by a professional chef</li></ul><p>This is a great opportunity for an aspirational Linux/DevOps professional to step up into a key role in a company that really combines the best of both worlds – resources and stability of a medium sized tech company but with all the fun, excitement and meaningful projects of a startup. You’ll be working in a team of developers and other DevOps, contribute to the road map going forward and build &amp; optimise the infrastructure to ensure that the development team work as efficiently as possible. Even if you’re not the 100% finished product it’s worth applying for as they have a very supportive culture. </p><p>Requirements:</p><p>Ideally you will have at least one year’s commercial experience as either a Linux System Administrator, DevOps Engineer or a related role. <strong>However please do not rule yourself out if you feel you’ve not got quite enough experience – our client is keen to consider passionate junior candidates too!</strong></p><p></p><strong>Salary :</strong> <p>Minimum:  35000.00<br>Maximum: 55000.00<br>Currency: British Pound .
