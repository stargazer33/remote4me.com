You care deeply about working on technology that affects people’s lives, and are passionate about building and maintaining large-scale systems that are well-designed, fast, scalable, and secure.</p><p><strong>You can work remotely, or from one of Nava’s offices in DC, SF, or NYC.</strong></p><p><strong>Opportunities and Challenges</strong></p><p>You will be working within the government ecosystem, which means working, sometimes closely, with other government contractors and civil servants. Working with people outside of your company means you’ll likely encounter different working styles and cultural norms. At the same time, working as part of a larger team allows us to deliver on projects of larger scale and complexity.</p><p>The government also imposes a level of bureaucracy that is typically not present in a company of our size in the private sector. We operate in a regulated environment, where checks and compliance is built into the process of building software. This can make the path to production slower and some decisions, such as tools and processes, lie outside of our control. However, beyond writing code, finding and recommending ways to improve the way government software is built is one of the highest-leverage ways we help fulfill our mission.</p><p>You will be working with legacy systems. While our work is to build new systems with up-to-date technology, we have to do that within an existing ecosystem. Our work is building functional, resilient software for production. We don’t build flashy prototypes that don’t work for real people. This usually means getting to know legacy systems, often with poor documentation and unreliable narrators, and trying to determine how to replicate the systems’ behavior or how to integrate with these systems. This is a great opportunity for engineers who enjoy software archaeology. If you care deeply about how software systems work over time, and building systems for longevity and resilience, this work is for you.</p><p><strong>Who we’re looking for</strong></p><p>You are a reliable, experienced engineer who cares deeply about building software that makes a real difference in people’s lives, and is keen to grapple with the complexities and trade-offs involved in building government software. You prefer using proven technologies to build well-designed systems that are scalable, performant, and secure.</p><p>You enjoy working on cross-functional teams, and collaborating with others, and you are able to direct yourself and work independently. You have empathy for the people who rely on your work, and you care about how your behavior affects others. You are humble and you value critical feedback and personal growth. You are comfortable receiving and giving kind, candid feedback.</p><p>Beyond coding ability, communication and teamwork skills are paramount. You must be able to communicate clearly and professionally in writing, in person, and through online tools, especially because we work with government stakeholders and other contractors.</p><p>You exhibit good judgment and are able to adapt to new situations well. You may encounter situations that no one on your team or at Nava has encountered before. You take responsibility and are able to persist through ambiguity to get to a solution.</p><p><strong>What you’ll do</strong></p><ul><li>Work with fellow Infrastructure Engineers to build and maintain our production infrastructure to ensure ongoing reliability while maximizing development team efficiency</li><li>Troubleshoot and debug infrastructure, network, and operating system issues</li><li>Build and maintain operations software which automates the configuration, provisioning, deployment and monitoring of our core systems</li><li>Manage security systems, linux file system permissions and network firewalls</li><li>Perform automated deployments to create new or update existing production environments</li><li>Set up and maintain alarm systems for notifications on error conditions</li><li>Join our on-call rotation as a first line of defense during production issues</li></ul><p><strong>What we’re looking for</strong></p><ul><li>Previous experience maintaining a medium or larger scale production system</li><li>Significant experience in one or more of the following areas: Cloud infrastructure, Unix/Linux, Scripting, or Security</li><li>Ability to automate procedural tasks using scripting or coding in Python, Javascript, or Ruby</li><li>A thoughtful, adaptive, and collaborative mindset</li><li>Understanding of networks, HTTP</li><li>Ability to use the shell to achieve practical aims. E.g. navigate the shell, SSH into machines, create SSH keys, read log files, move files, and start/stop services, search in files, change permissions</li><li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills, technical and otherwise</li><li>Ability to pick up and learn new development and operations skills</li></ul><p>We’re a small team working to radically improve our government, so everyone that joins us has a direct impact on the direction and success of Nava. We are stewards – we hold a deep responsibility towards the systems that we work with. We are a community – we value collaboration both within our teams and with the many hardworking people within government. We offer generous compensation and equity packages and value a healthy work/life balance.</p><p>We care deeply about diversity and inclusion at Nava. We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</p><p>Note that we participate in E-Verify and upon hire, will provide the federal government with your Form I-9 information to confirm that you are authorized to work in the U.S.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/nava/817283f6-9911-4f72-a5ef-fbcdd2c04a7c' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

We have two missions at ReCharge: make it easy for people to sell subscription products online, and create an amazing remote-first culture.</p><p>The first mission began as three people working out of a small apartment, trying to solve one of the biggest problems facing Shopify merchants: recurring payments. Now we’re at the forefront of recurring billing software, empowering thousands of entrepreneurs to sell their products as subscriptions, and processing tens of millions of dollars in sales every week.</p><p>Our culture is remote-first and we stay connected every day using Slack and video chat.

Work is an action, not a place at ReCharge and that’s why we've expanded our horizons from the Andes in Argentina to the Rockies in Denver, Colorado.&nbsp;By expanding our reach to build remote-first teams we've been able to uncover outstanding talent around the globe and are rapidly approaching 100 employees.</p><p>The ReCharge team maintains a work-life balance approach. We understand that hobbies exist and encourage our employees to pursue them. After joining you'll quickly find you have teammates that surf, sail, cycle, read (hardcovers!), tour the country in bands and festival hop - all while doing great work and exceeding expectations. Above all, we realize if you empower people to pursue their passions, they will help change the world.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive compensation, health benefits, 401K</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited paid time off (PTO) to pursue your passions</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team retreats - bi-annual retreats to share our successes together</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly ReCharge subscription</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment - we provide equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Everything derives from serving our patients.</p><p><strong>Secure, Reliable &amp; Flexible Data</strong></p><p>The features we build generate data. Some of it entirely unique to PeerWell. That data must be securely held, it must be reliably available, and&nbsp;be usable for innovation. We combine our patient data into populations so that we can discover and help predict the direction of patient outcomes, and thereby provide patients&nbsp;with information and guidance to aid their recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;So building secure, reliable, performative and flexible systems is always a focus.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong></p><p>We seek to make sure our products not only perform but provide an excellent experience along the way.

Our approach is through innovations that provide better care, efficiency, and knowledge to all the players.&nbsp; To this end we have created some never seen before innovations using smart-phones alone in the past couple of years, and we aim to do more. For example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Joint Range of Motion</li><li>Exercise Compliance</li><li>in-home Hazard Detection</li></ul><p>Sometimes, we apply well-known solutions and at others when innovation is needed we create something new. The point is, we innovate where it matters and has impact on patients and on the players who serve them.</p><p><strong>Civil Engagement</strong></p><p>We work together, often in different timezones. We expect kind and conscientious engagement with each other. Communication is essential, and honesty key.&nbsp; We are a diverse group of people with a variety of values, and we make it safe for everyone to do their work and express themselves.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Fully Remote Company!

We're nearing the end of a hiring push in engineering, but still have a couple roles to fill (as well as various opening across the rest of the organization). See them all here: <a href='https://www.elationhealth.com/careers/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.elationhealth.com/careers/</a></p><p>The biggest hiring focus at the moment is for Systems Engineering (cloud based infrastructure &amp; ops). Our engineering team is about half based in our San Francisco office and half remote, at the moment we're focused on adding some folks in the home office (though the Systems Engineer role is open to REMOTE). Tech stack is AWS/Python/Django/MySQL/ReactJS. We have a great team full of people that really value working closely with product, customer-experience, and users. Lots of interesting problems to solve!</p><p>Apply online at the link above -- Also feel free to reach out to me directly if you have any questions or are curious! I'm not the hiring manager for the SE role, but would be working closely with that individual, and would be happy to chat about the position, the company, or healthcare in general.</p>",

This encompasses around 70 services, ranging in scale from 2 users to 20 million concurrent connections, which are created by about a dozen different developer teams. Python is the most common language, though Nodejs, Go, Rust, and even Perl are also represented. When you take a look at the source of these services (most are publicly available in <a href='https://github.com/mozilla-services/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/mozilla-services/</a> and <a href='https://github.com/mozilla/' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/mozilla/</a>), you’ll notice that all are dockerized following the standards at <a href='https://github.com/mozilla-services/dockerflow' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/mozilla-services/dockerflow</a>.</p><p>Each service run by our team has a primary ops engineer as the main point of contact and a secondary to assist with engineering and on-call responsibilities, so no one person has to be familiar with every technology used in every service. Most services require on-call using pagerduty, but we regard pages as indicators of process problems and invest in the root cause analysis necessary changes to prevent failures from recurring. Although our top priority is keeping everything working well, you’ll often have the flexibility to balance your workload with services aligned with your skills and interests.</p><p>We standardize our infrastructure code across projects, so that your work in adding a feature to your own services’ infrastructure can easily be reused by the rest of the team. In our infrastructure Git repos, you’ll design, maintain, improve, and review automation, Python scripts, and monitoring code.</p><p>I'm told the postings should go live August 6th at <a href='https://careers.mozilla.org/listings/' rel='nofollow'>https://careers.mozilla.org/listings/</a> .

We strive to be cloud provider agnostic but we love folks that know Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud (GCP), and/or Microsoft Azure.</li>\n  <li>Instrumentation, Telemetry, and Monitoring best practices and tools. There’s a lot of ways to do this – what have you had success with?</li>\n  <li>Build, test, and deployment tools and best practices. Not all our SRE positions require this but having some experience here will be an advantage.</li>\n  <li>Chaos engineering principles, practices, and tools. Yes, we are willing to test in production – are you up for the challenge of wreaking chaos while ensuring system reliability?</li>\n  <li>Project management. We’re not looking for PMP certification but having a baseline understanding of how successful projects are delivered (e.g. planning, communication, risk management) is appreciated. We are evolving in our Agile and Lean processes so experience in these methods is a strong advantage.</li>\n  <li>Strong verbal and written communication.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>We are now on the lookout for a DevOps Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>As DevOps Engineer you will be responsible for ensuring that our different engineering teams have their needs covered when it comes to cross-cutting concerns such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD Pipelines.</p>\n <p>Your deliverables will have a direct impact on the day-to-day work of all our engineers. You will help them reduce the time to market of the tasks and features they are working on. Whilst development and operational efficiency will be your primary goal, you should also have an eye for performant and resilient infrastructures.</p>\n <p>Your responsibilities as DevOps Engineer at BlueLabs will include:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><p>Enable the different teams to deliver and operate their services on their own</p></li>\n  <li><p>Be a strong advocate for keeping all things automated and under version control</p></li>\n  <li><p>Provide DevOps and SRE expertise and best practices to all developers within the organisation</p></li>\n  <li><p>Work hand in hand with the Engineering Leads to execute the company's strategy and assist the development teams when it comes to topics such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD pipelines</p></li>\n  <li><p>Be the first point of contact when it comes to cross-cutting concerns, while ensuring that you do not become a single point of failure</p></li>\n </ul>\n <p>BlueLab’s Sports Betting platform consists of tens of microservices written in Elixir, Go and Scala. You are not required to have professional experience with either of these languages but being interested in them will be valued positively, since it will help you better understand the needs of our Engineering teams.</p>\n <p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p>\n <p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p>\n <p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>\n <p>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €65k-90k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p>\n <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>5+ years of professional experience working as a DevOps (or Systems) Engineer</li>\n  <li>Professional experience with GCP and/or AWS</li>\n  <li>Deep understanding of cloud technologies (e.g. GCP), container orchestration platforms (e.g. Kubernetes), infrastructure as code (e.g. Terraform), code instrumentation (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk) and CI/CD pipelines (e.g. Jenkins)</li>\n  <li>Interest in distributed systems</li>\n  <li>Interest in microservice architecture, data- and message-based technologies (e.g. RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka)</li>\n  <li>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</li>\n  <li>Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build</li>\n  <li>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</li>\n  <li>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/devops-engineer/c/new?source=Stack%20Overflow&amp;utm_source=stack_overflow&amp;utm_medium=job&amp;utm_campaign=devops' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Competitive Compensation</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span> </li> \n</ul>",

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart! \n  <br> \n  <br>You’ll be joining our Infrastructure Team, responsible for keeping Olo’s food ordering and delivery systems up and running reliably and securely. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our DevOps-oriented team uses Infrastructure-as-Code with automation wherever possible. The system has many moving parts and frequent deployments. \n  <br> \n  <br>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote! \n  <br> \n  <br>Responsibilities \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Building virtual infrastructure in cloud platforms such as AWS using Infrastructure as Code and tools such as Terraform and Ansible \n  <br> \n  <br>* Creating and Reviewing Pull requests for configuration updates and &nbsp;server provisioning \n  <br> \n  <br>* Assist in designing and maintaining build pipelines for Olo applications and infrastructure \n  <br> \n  <br>* Patching operating system and security related vulnerabilities \n  <br> \n  <br>* Configuring Load Balancers, VPCs, and Security Groups \n  <br> \n  <br>* Proactively monitoring all systems for uptime and security.

Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded user interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded website and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more. \n  <br> \n  <br>Olo’s office is located at One World Trade Center in Manhattan.&nbsp;We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

We drive continual improvement (kaizen) and are always looking to remove waste, risk or inefficiency from the entire SDLC so that our teams can reach their full potential. Key to this is our adoption of the DevOps mind-set across all stakeholders – not just the development teams!</p>\n <p>In order to realise this strategy, Worldpay runs a centralised team that provide the core DevOps capabilities required by the organisation (the DOCET team). The team designs, builds, tests, releases and supports our CI/CD pipeline which is used by engineering teams to build and deploy production applications to on- and off-premise environments including public clouds (AWS). Containers are a vital part of this architecture.</p>\n <p>Most important of all – we believe that DevOps is a culture, not a team. As such members of the team are expected to evangelise our DevOps capabilities; helping other teams help themselves and always looking to empower stakeholders through self-service tooling. Our vision is a lightning-fast distributed development capability, constantly delivering business value and sharing solutions for the benefit of all.</p>\n <p> <strong>How will you contribute on a day-to-day basis?</strong> </p>\n <p>An opportunity has arisen for a Senior DevOps Engineer to join this team and assist in building the future of Worldpay’s delivery pipeline.

Previous experience in DevOps design, engineering, implementation and support from a financial services organisation is ideal, and you will have experience with many of the following: CI/ CD pipelining, Ansible, Puppet, Chef High Availability and Disaster Recovery, Capacity Planning and Backup, Windows and Linux Administration, Application, Systems and Network Troubleshooting, Runbook Automation and Scripting, Application Performance Monitoring and Root Cause Analysis, Software Development Lifecycle, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Amazon Web Service (AWS), User and Process Documentation, Unit, Performance and Integration Testing.</p>\n <p>You will have the ability to build strong relationships with business and technology stakeholders through open and honest dialogue. Knowledge of payment applications and services are ideal.</p>\n <p> <strong>How is Worldpay changing the world?</strong> </p>\n <p>Worldpay has merged with Vantiv Inc. to create a new global leader in payments. The new Worldpay will have the scale, the reach and the resources to take our success story to another level. This move allows us to expand further into high growth markets, deliver innovation at scale and above all, brings together exceptional talent and a shared passion that will help propel us forward to the next chapter of our collective story.</p>\n <p>Our technology enables billions of payments to be made each year whether online or in person.
