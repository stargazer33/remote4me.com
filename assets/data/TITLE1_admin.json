We’re accomplishing this mission daily by providing a platform that allows developers and product teams to automatically collect ultra high definition analytics from their sites and applications, then make those analytics available through a powerful search engine, pixel-perfect session playback, and machine learning insights.</p><p>Capturing and processing data at this level of completeness is no mean task. Challenges range from developing highly performant JS that hooks into the browser at its lowest levels on our Recording &amp; Replay team, to building the backend that scales to ingest and provide analysis of all that data on our Search &amp; Insights team. And the scale that FullStory runs at means that there are lots of interesting problems and opportunities for high-leverage contribution.</p><p>We’re also launching our new privacy-first analytics platform on mobile that takes an entirely new approach to application session capture. If things like Rust, app and framework disassembly, or reverse engineering sound like fun, we’d love to talk to talk.</p><p>FullStory is a remote-friendly, hyper-growth SaaS company based out of Atlanta. The work environment we've cultivated is aligned around our three watchwords: clarity, empathy, and bionics. We value high-quality/low-ego collaboration and use automation to eliminate toil in daily work.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>We are now on the lookout for a DevOps Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>As DevOps Engineer you will be responsible for ensuring that our different engineering teams have their needs covered when it comes to cross-cutting concerns such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD Pipelines.</p>\n <p>Your deliverables will have a direct impact on the day-to-day work of all our engineers. You will help them reduce the time to market of the tasks and features they are working on. Whilst development and operational efficiency will be your primary goal, you should also have an eye for performant and resilient infrastructures.</p>\n <p>Your responsibilities as DevOps Engineer at BlueLabs will include:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><p>Enable the different teams to deliver and operate their services on their own</p></li>\n  <li><p>Be a strong advocate for keeping all things automated and under version control</p></li>\n  <li><p>Provide DevOps and SRE expertise and best practices to all developers within the organisation</p></li>\n  <li><p>Work hand in hand with the Engineering Leads to execute the company's strategy and assist the development teams when it comes to topics such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD pipelines</p></li>\n  <li><p>Be the first point of contact when it comes to cross-cutting concerns, while ensuring that you do not become a single point of failure</p></li>\n </ul>\n <p>BlueLab’s Sports Betting platform consists of tens of microservices written in Elixir, Go and Scala. You are not required to have professional experience with either of these languages but being interested in them will be valued positively, since it will help you better understand the needs of our Engineering teams.</p>\n <p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p>\n <p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p>\n <p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>\n <p>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €65k-90k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p>\n <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>5+ years of professional experience working as a DevOps (or Systems) Engineer</li>\n  <li>Professional experience with GCP and/or AWS</li>\n  <li>Deep understanding of cloud technologies (e.g. GCP), container orchestration platforms (e.g. Kubernetes), infrastructure as code (e.g. Terraform), code instrumentation (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk) and CI/CD pipelines (e.g. Jenkins)</li>\n  <li>Interest in distributed systems</li>\n  <li>Interest in microservice architecture, data- and message-based technologies (e.g. RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka)</li>\n  <li>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</li>\n  <li>Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build</li>\n  <li>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</li>\n  <li>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/devops-engineer/c/new?source=Stack%20Overflow&amp;utm_source=stack_overflow&amp;utm_medium=job&amp;utm_campaign=devops' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Competitive Compensation</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span> </li> \n</ul>",

Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart! \n  <br> \n  <br>You’ll be joining our Infrastructure Team, responsible for keeping Olo’s food ordering and delivery systems up and running reliably and securely. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our DevOps-oriented team uses Infrastructure-as-Code with automation wherever possible.

We drive continual improvement (kaizen) and are always looking to remove waste, risk or inefficiency from the entire SDLC so that our teams can reach their full potential. Key to this is our adoption of the DevOps mind-set across all stakeholders – not just the development teams!</p>\n <p>In order to realise this strategy, Worldpay runs a centralised team that provide the core DevOps capabilities required by the organisation (the DOCET team). The team designs, builds, tests, releases and supports our CI/CD pipeline which is used by engineering teams to build and deploy production applications to on- and off-premise environments including public clouds (AWS). Containers are a vital part of this architecture.</p>\n <p>Most important of all – we believe that DevOps is a culture, not a team. As such members of the team are expected to evangelise our DevOps capabilities; helping other teams help themselves and always looking to empower stakeholders through self-service tooling. Our vision is a lightning-fast distributed development capability, constantly delivering business value and sharing solutions for the benefit of all.</p>\n <p> <strong>How will you contribute on a day-to-day basis?</strong> </p>\n <p>An opportunity has arisen for a Senior DevOps Engineer to join this team and assist in building the future of Worldpay’s delivery pipeline. You will work alongside other talented engineers to determine how best to meet the requirements of the business, and then turning that into a reliable, scalable and supported pipeline used by agile development teams across different business areas and geographical locations.<br>As a senior member of the team you will be expected to engage with stakeholders, provide technical leadership both within the team and to development teams starting on the DevOps journey, and should expect to take ownership for one or more of the tools that the team support.</p>\n <p> <strong>What will make you the right fit for the team?</strong> </p>\n <p>You will have extensive DevOps engineering and tools experience, as well as solid understanding of DevOps and Middleware implementations. Previous experience in DevOps design, engineering, implementation and support from a financial services organisation is ideal, and you will have experience with many of the following: CI/ CD pipelining, Ansible, Puppet, Chef High Availability and Disaster Recovery, Capacity Planning and Backup, Windows and Linux Administration, Application, Systems and Network Troubleshooting, Runbook Automation and Scripting, Application Performance Monitoring and Root Cause Analysis, Software Development Lifecycle, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Amazon Web Service (AWS), User and Process Documentation, Unit, Performance and Integration Testing.</p>\n <p>You will have the ability to build strong relationships with business and technology stakeholders through open and honest dialogue. Knowledge of payment applications and services are ideal.</p>\n <p> <strong>How is Worldpay changing the world?</strong> </p>\n <p>Worldpay has merged with Vantiv Inc. to create a new global leader in payments. The new Worldpay will have the scale, the reach and the resources to take our success story to another level. This move allows us to expand further into high growth markets, deliver innovation at scale and above all, brings together exceptional talent and a shared passion that will help propel us forward to the next chapter of our collective story.</p>\n <p>Our technology enables billions of payments to be made each year whether online or in person. Working with customers large and small we help them to take payments quickly, safely and reliably, allowing them to grow their businesses and making your life more convenient in the process.</p>\n <p></p> \n <div> \n  <a href='https://www.jobg8.com/Traffic.aspx?VErAys6JIkGU%2bzCmviqJIQb' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n </div> \n</div>",

As the internet’s regulatory landscape fractures around the globe, SaaS providers are increasing subject to strict controls regulating how and where certain information is stored. InCountry - founded by six-time founder Peter Yared - is building a global, targeted storage and compute network which allows customers to transparently meet data regulations as they are changing around the world.\n<p>We are seeking senior engineers to join our team to work on a wide range of distributed systems and cloud infrastructure problems. We have technical challenges on a deep stack including: highly available systems and storage, cluster management, global networking, container orchestration, secure systems and key management, performance scaling and API design. Currently our stack is focused around Python and Postgres, but we will introduce Golang and Mongo DB to the stack this year.</p>\n<p>Some key qualifications:</p>\n<p>- Extensive experience with cloud infrastructure, either as a user or builder- Experience up and down the stack- You have carried the pager and operated web systems at scale</p>\n<p>This is a chance to help build critical global infrastructure from the ground up. We are looking for people willing to code and mentor, but who can also write a great design spec. We are growing fast and working in a rapidly changing global landscape, so you should enjoy working fast in the face of ambiguity. The trade-off is autonomy, fast decisions, and big impact.

You will be supporting our colleagues, ensuring maximum uptime for public services whilst keeping pace with industry trends and acting as a spokesperson for their best practice and adoption.</p>\n <p> Some of your time will be spent on routine ‘Ops’ work such as managing on-call incidents, patching and security checks.

Everything derives from serving our patients.</p>\n <p><strong>Secure, Reliable &amp; Flexible Data</strong></p>\n <p>The features we build generate data. Some of it entirely unique to PeerWell. That data must be securely held, it must be reliably available, and&nbsp;be usable for innovation. We combine our patient data into populations so that we can discover and help predict the direction of patient outcomes, and thereby provide patients&nbsp;with information and guidance to aid their recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;So building secure, reliable, performative and flexible systems is always a focus.&nbsp;</p>\n <p><strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong></p>\n <p>We seek to make sure our products not only perform but provide an excellent experience along the way. There are many users we serve ranging from patients, to nurses, and doctors, and insurers, and others. We seek to produce defect free software to serve them all, whatever their roles are with respect to the patient.</p>\n <p><strong>Innovation and Appropriate Problem Solving</strong></p>\n <p>We are looking to improve a very large and complex healthcare system. Our approach is through innovations that provide better care, efficiency, and knowledge to all the players.&nbsp; To this end we have created some never seen before innovations using smart-phones alone in the past couple of years, and we aim to do more. For example:&nbsp;</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Joint Range of Motion</li>\n  <li>Exercise Compliance</li>\n  <li>in-home Hazard Detection</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Sometimes, we apply well-known solutions and at others when innovation is needed we create something new. The point is, we innovate where it matters and has impact on patients and on the players who serve them.</p>\n <p><strong>Civil Engagement</strong></p>\n <p>We work together, often in different timezones. We expect kind and conscientious engagement with each other. Communication is essential, and honesty key.&nbsp; We are a diverse group of people with a variety of values, and we make it safe for everyone to do their work and express themselves.</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Fully Remote Company!
