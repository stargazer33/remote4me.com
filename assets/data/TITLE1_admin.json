There’s a lot of ways to do this – what have you had success with?</li>\n  <li>Build, test, and deployment tools and best practices. Not all our SRE positions require this but having some experience here will be an advantage.</li>\n  <li>Chaos engineering principles, practices, and tools. Yes, we are willing to test in production – are you up for the challenge of wreaking chaos while ensuring system reliability?</li>\n  <li>Project management. We’re not looking for PMP certification but having a baseline understanding of how successful projects are delivered (e.g. planning, communication, risk management) is appreciated. We are evolving in our Agile and Lean processes so experience in these methods is a strong advantage.</li>\n  <li>Strong verbal and written communication.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>We are now on the lookout for a DevOps Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.&nbsp;</p>\n <p>As DevOps Engineer you will be responsible for ensuring that our different engineering teams have their needs covered when it comes to cross-cutting concerns such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD Pipelines.</p>\n <p>Your deliverables will have a direct impact on the day-to-day work of all our engineers. You will help them reduce the time to market of the tasks and features they are working on. Whilst development and operational efficiency will be your primary goal, you should also have an eye for performant and resilient infrastructures.</p>\n <p>Your responsibilities as DevOps Engineer at BlueLabs will include:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li><p>Enable the different teams to deliver and operate their services on their own</p></li>\n  <li><p>Be a strong advocate for keeping all things automated and under version control</p></li>\n  <li><p>Provide DevOps and SRE expertise and best practices to all developers within the organisation</p></li>\n  <li><p>Work hand in hand with the Engineering Leads to execute the company's strategy and assist the development teams when it comes to topics such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD pipelines</p></li>\n  <li><p>Be the first point of contact when it comes to cross-cutting concerns, while ensuring that you do not become a single point of failure</p></li>\n </ul>\n <p>BlueLab’s Sports Betting platform consists of tens of microservices written in Elixir, Go and Scala. You are not required to have professional experience with either of these languages but being interested in them will be valued positively, since it will help you better understand the needs of our Engineering teams.</p>\n <p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p>\n <p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p>\n <p><strong>Compensation</strong></p>\n <p>The budgeted compensation range for this role is €65k-90k annually, depending on your background and experience. As an independent contractor you will be responsible for paying any taxes or applicable fees in your country of residence (unless you are based in Malta, in which case you will be employed).&nbsp;In addition to that, we offer a number of&nbsp;<a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/#section-127563' rel='nofollow'>perks</a>&nbsp;to each of our team members as we truly believe in a healthy work-life balance and continuous learning.</p>\n <p><strong>Requirements</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>5+ years of professional experience working as a DevOps (or Systems) Engineer</li>\n  <li>Professional experience with GCP and/or AWS</li>\n  <li>Deep understanding of cloud technologies (e.g. GCP), container orchestration platforms (e.g. Kubernetes), infrastructure as code (e.g. Terraform), code instrumentation (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk) and CI/CD pipelines (e.g. Jenkins)</li>\n  <li>Interest in distributed systems</li>\n  <li>Interest in microservice architecture, data- and message-based technologies (e.g. RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka)</li>\n  <li>Interest in keeping yourself up to date and learning new languages, frameworks and technologies as required</li>\n  <li>Product-oriented mindset and eagerness to take part in shaping the products we build</li>\n  <li>Ability to work autonomously in a fully distributed team</li>\n  <li>Good communication skills in verbal and written English</li>\n </ul> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://careers.bluelabs.eu/o/devops-engineer/c/new?source=Stack%20Overflow&amp;utm_source=stack_overflow&amp;utm_medium=job&amp;utm_campaign=devops' rel='nofollow'> Apply now </a>\n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Distributed Team, enabling us to hire Europe's best talents</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Work only with the latest technologies</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Use the best tools and resources money can buy</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Regular onsite meetings across Europe</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Competitive Compensation</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Personal Development Allowance of €1,000 annually</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Co-Working Space &amp; Home Office Allowances</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible working hours and time-off policy</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Monthly wellbeing allowance for Gym Membership, Massages etc.</span> </li> \n</ul>",

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart! \n  <br> \n  <br>You’ll be joining our Infrastructure Team, responsible for keeping Olo’s food ordering and delivery systems up and running reliably and securely. \n  <br> \n  <br>Our DevOps-oriented team uses Infrastructure-as-Code with automation wherever possible. The system has many moving parts and frequent deployments. \n  <br> \n  <br>Any engineer may work at Olo’s headquarters in New York City’s Financial District or remotely from anywhere in the U.S. In fact, more than half of our engineering team is remote! \n  <br> \n  <br>Responsibilities \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Building virtual infrastructure in cloud platforms such as AWS using Infrastructure as Code and tools such as Terraform and Ansible \n  <br> \n  <br>* Creating and Reviewing Pull requests for configuration updates and &nbsp;server provisioning \n  <br> \n  <br>* Assist in designing and maintaining build pipelines for Olo applications and infrastructure \n  <br> \n  <br>* Patching operating system and security related vulnerabilities \n  <br> \n  <br>* Configuring Load Balancers, VPCs, and Security Groups \n  <br> \n  <br>* Proactively monitoring all systems for uptime and security.

Olo’s enterprise-grade software powers every stage of the digital restaurant transaction, from fully-branded user interfaces to the back-of-house order management features that keep the kitchen running smoothly. Orders from Olo are injected seamlessly into existing restaurant systems to help brands capture demand from on-demand channels such as branded website and apps, third-party marketplaces, social media channels, and personal assistant devices like the Amazon Echo. Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love.

We drive continual improvement (kaizen) and are always looking to remove waste, risk or inefficiency from the entire SDLC so that our teams can reach their full potential. Key to this is our adoption of the DevOps mind-set across all stakeholders – not just the development teams!</p>\n <p>In order to realise this strategy, Worldpay runs a centralised team that provide the core DevOps capabilities required by the organisation (the DOCET team). The team designs, builds, tests, releases and supports our CI/CD pipeline which is used by engineering teams to build and deploy production applications to on- and off-premise environments including public clouds (AWS). Containers are a vital part of this architecture.</p>\n <p>Most important of all – we believe that DevOps is a culture, not a team. As such members of the team are expected to evangelise our DevOps capabilities; helping other teams help themselves and always looking to empower stakeholders through self-service tooling. Our vision is a lightning-fast distributed development capability, constantly delivering business value and sharing solutions for the benefit of all.</p>\n <p> <strong>How will you contribute on a day-to-day basis?</strong> </p>\n <p>An opportunity has arisen for a Senior DevOps Engineer to join this team and assist in building the future of Worldpay’s delivery pipeline.

Previous experience in DevOps design, engineering, implementation and support from a financial services organisation is ideal, and you will have experience with many of the following: CI/ CD pipelining, Ansible, Puppet, Chef High Availability and Disaster Recovery, Capacity Planning and Backup, Windows and Linux Administration, Application, Systems and Network Troubleshooting, Runbook Automation and Scripting, Application Performance Monitoring and Root Cause Analysis, Software Development Lifecycle, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Amazon Web Service (AWS), User and Process Documentation, Unit, Performance and Integration Testing.</p>\n <p>You will have the ability to build strong relationships with business and technology stakeholders through open and honest dialogue. Knowledge of payment applications and services are ideal.</p>\n <p> <strong>How is Worldpay changing the world?</strong> </p>\n <p>Worldpay has merged with Vantiv Inc. to create a new global leader in payments. The new Worldpay will have the scale, the reach and the resources to take our success story to another level. This move allows us to expand further into high growth markets, deliver innovation at scale and above all, brings together exceptional talent and a shared passion that will help propel us forward to the next chapter of our collective story.</p>\n <p>Our technology enables billions of payments to be made each year whether online or in person.

As the internet’s regulatory landscape fractures around the globe, SaaS providers are increasing subject to strict controls regulating how and where certain information is stored. InCountry - founded by six-time founder Peter Yared - is building a global, targeted storage and compute network which allows customers to transparently meet data regulations as they are changing around the world.\n<p>We are seeking senior engineers to join our team to work on a wide range of distributed systems and cloud infrastructure problems. We have technical challenges on a deep stack including: highly available systems and storage, cluster management, global networking, container orchestration, secure systems and key management, performance scaling and API design. Currently our stack is focused around Python and Postgres, but we will introduce Golang and Mongo DB to the stack this year.</p>\n<p>Some key qualifications:</p>\n<p>- Extensive experience with cloud infrastructure, either as a user or builder- Experience up and down the stack- You have carried the pager and operated web systems at scale</p>\n<p>This is a chance to help build critical global infrastructure from the ground up. We are looking for people willing to code and mentor, but who can also write a great design spec. We are growing fast and working in a rapidly changing global landscape, so you should enjoy working fast in the face of ambiguity. The trade-off is autonomy, fast decisions, and big impact. Work wherever you want - InCountry is already a globally distributed team.</p>\n<p>Headquarters is in SF, but we are globally distributed and encourage remote applicants.Apply jobs at incountry.com or <a href='https://www.indeed.com/job/hands-architect-cloud-infrastructure-remote-ok-014a7ac5aae61f12' rel='nofollow'>https://www.indeed.com/job/hands-architect-cloud-infrastruct...</a></p>",

You should have strong opinions about tools and architecture, but should also be able to explain those opinions persuasively, not abrasively. You should also take pride in writing performant, logically structured, and readable code, but be pragmatic enough to realize that sometimes shipped code is better than perfect code. \n  <br> \n  <br>Ideal Skills and Experience \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* 5+ years experience working as a cloud engineer ot backend developer. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience with varied AWS services: ECS, CloudFront, SQS, S3, EC2 \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience with devops and CI/CD (ideally, GitLab CI). \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience building web apps, single page apps, and GraphQL APIs a big plus. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience with Elixir/Erlang or strong desire to learn. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Ability to write performant SQL queries and tune as needed. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience writing automated tests and following coding standards. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Willingness to perform code reviews and refactor existing code. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Experience working in a geographically distributed team. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Desire to collaborate with other developers and ability to communicate over various channels (email, phone, Slack, Google Hangouts, etc.) \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Working Relationship \n  <br> \n  <br>This is a full-time salaried position starting immediately. You will work with the existing development team to build new features and fix bugs in our product. \n  <br>This is a remote work opportunity, but you should be able to work core hours in U.S. pacific time. \n </div> \n</div>",

As one of Future’s Senior Site Reliability Engineers you’ll be coordinating a globally distributed team to achieve highly resilient, cost effective distributed service environments. You will be collaborating with our software development teams, key project stakeholders and vendors to ensure our technical delivery aligns with the business strategy.</p>\n <p> You will ensure that all our services meet their availability objectives, and collaborate with the technology teams to build highly resilient services and workflows. An SRE role is similar to a DevOps Engineer role and emphasises our objective to maintain a robust and performant organisation from all aspects of its technical process from CI/CD patterns to routing traffic around failing regions.</p>\n <p> This is a challenging role! You will be supporting our colleagues, ensuring maximum uptime for public services whilst keeping pace with industry trends and acting as a spokesperson for their best practice and adoption.</p>\n <p> Some of your time will be spent on routine ‘Ops’ work such as managing on-call incidents, patching and security checks. When not working on operations tasks you will be working with the Technology teams to improve our service to meet service level objectives, improve service operability and delivering their product objectives.</p>\n <p> To succeed in this role you will be a proficient software developer, with experience in networking, storage, containerisation, and Linux operating systems. This is a complex and ever-changing business so you will need to be able to attend to unfamiliar situations, logically identifying the key aspects to focus upon before working empirically to meet the objectives at hand.</p>\n <p> <strong>Key role responsibilities</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Respond to out of hours incidents as part of a shared rota</li>\n  <li>Take ownership of SRE projects and drive them forward</li>\n  <li>Be accountable for meeting Futures SLOs</li>\n  <li>Collaborate closely with development and project team mates to deliver on our shared goals</li>\n  <li>Implement, evolve and maintain runbooks, automation and documentation to improve working practices and system operation</li>\n  <li>Attend events, conferences and workshops to maintain awareness of industry trends and support their adoption within the organisation</li>\n  <li>Design, build and operate highly resilient, performant and observable infrastructure that serves the changing business objectives</li>\n  <li>Collaborate with third-party suppliers and customers where required to support business requirements</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Department Summary</strong></p>\n <p> The SRE position operates within the Technology &amp; Engineering department at Future. We provide the global digital infrastructure and support required to deliver a multitude of high traffic brand websites, ecommerce/content analysis systems, back-office services and advertising services.</p>\n <p> The Engineering team has recently become globally distributed and is providing new challenges and opportunities to our operating model.</p>\n <p> We frequently participate in hackdays, local meetups and larger conferences to ensure our skills are kept sharp and to work with different members of the team.</p>\n <p><strong>What you will need to succeed</strong></p>\n <p>Future’s operating infrastructure is very broad requiring an equally broad set of skills to support. As part of the SRE team you are not expected to be an expert in all fields but to recognise your own strengths and support the group. The principal systems we desire awareness of includes;</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Containerisation and orchestration, eg Kubernetes, Docker-Swarm</li>\n  <li>CI/CD practices and tooling such as Jenkins, Gitlab-CI, Spinnaker, ArgoCD</li>\n  <li>Observability at scale with tools such as Prometheus, Sensu, CloudWatch</li>\n  <li>On-prem and cloud hosting providers (eg XenServer, AWS)</li>\n  <li>Automation and Configuration Management tooling such as Ansible, Puppet, Chef, TerraForm</li>\n  <li>Development languages such as Python, Ruby or Golang </li>\n </ul>\n <p></p> \n <div> \n  <a href='https://www.jobg8.com/Traffic.aspx?RhEZzU3WQ81UiSFlGL7y3gt' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n </div> \n</div>",

All the features we create and their quality is driven first and foremost by what benefits our patients the most.&nbsp; Along the way, we serve the system that delivers care through patient's providers and the healthcare payers. Everything derives from serving our patients.</p>\n <p><strong>Secure, Reliable &amp; Flexible Data</strong></p>\n <p>The features we build generate data. Some of it entirely unique to PeerWell. That data must be securely held, it must be reliably available, and&nbsp;be usable for innovation. We combine our patient data into populations so that we can discover and help predict the direction of patient outcomes, and thereby provide patients&nbsp;with information and guidance to aid their recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;So building secure, reliable, performative and flexible systems is always a focus.&nbsp;</p>\n <p><strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong></p>\n <p>We seek to make sure our products not only perform but provide an excellent experience along the way. There are many users we serve ranging from patients, to nurses, and doctors, and insurers, and others. We seek to produce defect free software to serve them all, whatever their roles are with respect to the patient.</p>\n <p><strong>Innovation and Appropriate Problem Solving</strong></p>\n <p>We are looking to improve a very large and complex healthcare system. Our approach is through innovations that provide better care, efficiency, and knowledge to all the players.&nbsp; To this end we have created some never seen before innovations using smart-phones alone in the past couple of years, and we aim to do more. For example:&nbsp;</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Joint Range of Motion</li>\n  <li>Exercise Compliance</li>\n  <li>in-home Hazard Detection</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Sometimes, we apply well-known solutions and at others when innovation is needed we create something new. The point is, we innovate where it matters and has impact on patients and on the players who serve them.</p>\n <p><strong>Civil Engagement</strong></p>\n <p>We work together, often in different timezones.

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p>\n <p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p>\n <p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p>\n <p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p>\n <p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p>\n <p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p>\n <p>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume. If we believe that you will be a good match, we'll contact you to arrange the next steps.

We spend our time thinking about how to give a global workforce complete control of their own work life while automating the hundreds of thousands of man hours which would normally be required to manage people on this scale.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We do this using React &amp; Typescript on the frontend backed up by GraphQL servers, some written in Ruby and Rails and some in Elixir and Phoenix.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Businesses ranging from the largest high-street retailers to five star hotels and independent coffee boutiques rely on Catapult as their casual workforce. If you’ve spent time in a large UK city, you’ve probably been served by a Catapult waiter or sales assistant without even realising it!\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  We’re well funded by some amazing investors, our product is live in over 100 locations across the UK and we’ve recently launched in Berlin making us the first and only pan-european player in this space.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  Our company values https://writing.joincatapult.com/our-values/ are really important to us and influence every facet of how we work together.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  As our distributed product organisation grows, we're looking for somebody to help us improve our devops infrastructure and tooling, this includes:\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  1. Migrating our CI (gitlab) and feature branch deploys (GKE) to AWS\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  2. Upgrading our delivery pipeline for our mobile applications\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  3. Creating tooling and documentation to help engineers interact with our infrastructure\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  4. Helping us optimise our database infrastructure as we scale\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  And probably many other challenges we don't yet know about! You can read more about how we approach engineering with our engineering principles; https://writing.joincatapult.com/engineering-principles/\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  For now we're looking for someone to work with us on this 1-3 days a week, we're happy to be flexible on logistics, we could also work on a project basis. We're also flexible on direct employment v contracting depending on situation, location and structure.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <b>About You</b>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  You've got deep experience working with AWS but are equally happy working on bare metal or with generic VPS providers like Linode or Digital Ocean. You're comfortable working with Ansible and Terraform and consider anything which isn't fully automated unfinished. You consider DevOps to be a first class value adding field rather than a support function and like to work closely with the rest of the product organisation.\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n</div>\n<div>\n <h4> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more DevOps &amp; Sysadmin jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h4>\n <ul>\n  <li><span>New</span>\n   <div></div>\n   <div>\n    <a rel='nofollow'>\n     <div></div><span>View company profile</span></a>\n   </div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Snappy Kraken</span><br><span>Lead Software Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>USA</span></a></li>\n  <li><span>New</span>\n   <div></div>\n   <div>\n    <a rel='nofollow'>\n     <div></div><span>View company profile</span></a>\n   </div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Snappy Kraken</span><br><span>AWS Certified SysOps Administrator</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>USA</span></a></li>\n  <li><span>New</span>\n   <div></div>\n   <div>\n    <a rel='nofollow'>\n     <div></div><span>View company profile</span></a>\n   </div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Files.com</span><br><span>Senior Infrastructure Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>U.S.A.</span></a></li>\n </ul>\n <br>\n</div>",

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p>\n <p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p>\n <p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p>\n <p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p>\n <p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p>\n <p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p>\n <p>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

We’re a European VC-Backed startup with a host of blue-chip Enterprise clients and a string of awards and grants (including €2m from the EU Horizon 2020 program). \n  <br> \n  <br>Platform.sh is built on top of open source languages, libraries and projects. But we never shy away from writing code. This means that even if there is an existing open source project that covers much of the functionality of something we want to achieve, we will consider, and often enough, chose to write our own implementation; Because sometimes 80/20 is not good enough. We have our own orchestration layer, our own reverse proxy, our own file-systems, our own reproducible build system. \n  <br> \n  <br>To reinforce our technical prowess, we are looking to grow our operations team with an operations coordinator that knows their way around Linux.

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p>\n <p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p>\n <p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p>\n <p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p>\n <p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in.

We believe in change through accountability, debate, ambition and respect for the communities and individuals that make up our networked universe(s).&nbsp;</p>\n <p>Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to control a large group of people from the top down, which is why military organizations, industrial corporations and nation-states have relied on it so heavily. But hierarchies carry their own institutional costs, which means that a regulatory bureaucracy can focus only on a few issues at a time – generally those most important to the people at the top or to the dominant groups in the ruling coalition.</p>\n <p>But what if we can organize this company to embody the very structures of those network communication technologies and digital platforms we hope to build? What if this can enable us to take on all those dinosaur hierarchies as equals - and more than equals? What if self-regulation and social cooperation can be amplified and intensified in this way to empower all of us to care for our selves and ourselves without any authority?</p>\n <p>That’s why Mav Farm is&nbsp;stigmergic. Like the products we build, stigmergy is a form of self-organization social network. It's the principle that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergic networks are superior to hierarchies, in that they are not slowed down by bureaucratic permission-seeking, communication asymmetries and problems associated with top-down coordination. Instead stigmergy allows individual contributors or cells to freely work within a shared platform, contributing to a shared goal as they see fit.</p>\n <p>With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project. The innovations of individual contributors can freely travel throughout the chain when others wish to adopt them. Think of stigmergy as a heuristic approach to improving everything, allowing all of us to be agile and flexible.</p>\n <p>This is our shorthand way of saying that we don’t have any management, and nobody “reports to” anybody else. We do have Founders, but even they aren't your manager. This company is yours to steer—toward opportunities and away from risks, toward high performance and quick creative fixes. You have the power to green-light projects. You have the power to ship products.</p>\n <p>In this stigmergic structure every organizational barrier is removed between your work and the customer enjoying that work. Every company will tell you that “the customer is boss,” but here that statement has weight. There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what our customers want, and then giving it to them.</p>\n <p>So far, our team has designed, architected and built things like: motion tracking in video, object recognition in video, machine learning recommender systems, real-time graphics shaders, AR shopping experiences, business intelligence dashboards, marketplace apps, video streaming apps and more. Our sights are set high! Where will you take us?</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Full medical, dental and vision</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Retirement/401K Plan</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Unlimited PTO</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible schedules</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Life &amp; Disability coverage</span> </li> \n</ul>",

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p>\n <p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p>\n <p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p>\n <p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p>\n <p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p>\n <p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p>\n <p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p>\n <p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p>\n <p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p>\n <p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p>\n <p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p>\n <p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Commuter Benefits</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span> </li> \n</ul>",

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p>\n <p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p>\n <p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p>\n <p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p>\n <p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p>\n <p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p>\n <p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p>\n <p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p>\n <p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p>\n <p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p>\n <p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p>\n <p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p> \n</div> \n<h4>Benefits</h4> \n<ul> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Commuter Benefits</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span> </li> \n <li> <span></span> <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span> </li> \n</ul>",
