Have you ever empathized with those whose job it is to deliver customer experience and imagined how, if properly empowered and motivated, the overall service delivery experience could be better? If so, we want to talk.</p><p>In the Cisco Customer Journey Solutions R&amp;D group, we are passionate about delivering amazing experiences to both customers and employees. We believe software can truly change the world and how it gives and receives customer service and it is our mission to be the leader in this space. To enable this vision, we are looking for passionate, smart, and motivated Site Reliability Engineers to join our Client Experiences team.</p><p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p><ul><li>A software engineer and/or a scripting-savvy Linux system administrator who hates the monotony and boredom of manual tasks and you love the challenge of taking the most complex manual procedures and automating them.</li><li>You look at production systems – ideally SaaS systems – as an interesting and infinite problem domain in which you can apply your craft to deliver an equally infinite value stream of solutions.</li><li>You could also be an “Ops” professional that can seek out and anticipate problems before they happen and take action to avoid them. Your scars, PTSD, and your medals of valor will be prized here.</li><li>A challenge seeking, outcome-hungry problem solver with an insatiable curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit.</li><li>A customer-obsessed advocate for quality and reliability. You smile when thinking of ways you have made a customer’s (and/or colleague’s) life easier.</li><li>You have read about (or are willing to read) and deeply understand Google’s SRE work. However, founding a religious order on the subject, albeit impressive, is not required.</li><li>A loyal team player that strives to win and win together, leaving no one behind.</li><li>A coach, mentor, trainer, perpetual student, and all-around good person that colleagues love and respect.</li></ul><p><strong>Some skills we’d like you to have…</strong></p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: We are looking for all levels of expertise and are willing to train you beyond whatever level you are at in any of these areas.</p><ul><li>Programming/scripting in one or many languages. We use Bash, Python, Java, and some Golang but we’re always looking for new and improved options.</li><li>Linux operating system administration. We are looking for all levels of expertise and are willing to train you beyond a foundational ability.</li><li>Cloud computing in one or many public cloud providers. We strive to be cloud provider agnostic but we love folks that know Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud (GCP), and/or Microsoft Azure.</li><li>Instrumentation, Telemetry, and Monitoring best practices and tools. There’s a lot of ways to do this – what have you had success with?</li><li>Build, test, and deployment tools and best practices. Not all our SRE positions require this but having some experience here will be an advantage.</li><li>Chaos engineering principles, practices, and tools. Yes, we are willing to test in production – are you up for the challenge of wreaking chaos while ensuring system reliability?</li><li>Project management. We’re not looking for PMP certification but having a baseline understanding of how successful projects are delivered (e.g. planning, communication, risk management) is appreciated. We are evolving in our Agile and Lean processes so experience in these methods is a strong advantage.</li><li>Strong verbal and written communication. We value honesty and directness while maintaining a safe and trusting professional environment.</li></ul>        </div><div>        <a href='https://jobs.cisco.com/jobs/ProjectDetail/Site-Reliability-Engineer-Webex-Contact-Center/1262459' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

Our client gets that!!!   <br>   <br>That's why they embrace and encourage peoples' uniqueness, helping to give them the strength and confidence to show the world who they really are. The coverage, expertise and services we provide are at the very core of how we help people achieve their full potential – and ultimately, improve their health, well-being and sense of security.   <br>Before they can accomplish any of that, we have to have the right people in place.   <br>The Delivery Acceleration Solutions Group's goal is to help the organization to rapidly produce software products and services while thinking about quality throughout the SDLC. This is the essence of DevOps. Are you an individual who understands the DevOps mentality? Do you have a start-up attitude, but think like an enterprise? Like taking risks and love it when it pays off? The healthcare industry is evolving and time to market is critical to success. Our Client is changing and as our CIO has said: &quot;We are not moving fast enough.” We need an individual who thinks differently and has the experience to influence an organization.   <br>----------   <br>Major Responsibilities:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Collaborate with team members (including scrum masters, product owners, system architecture ) to implement solutions supporting the DevOps evolution.   <br>   <br>* Extend our existing CI/CD best practices to our public cloud platforms to create a reusable pipeline for those workloads   <br>   <br>* Create additional supporting solutions using languages like Python, Node, Groovy or Go.   <br>   <br>* Ensure that everything we run (products or in-house developed solutions) are deployed using the same deployment automation (CI/CD) pipelines we build for our enterprise counterparts (Jenkins CI, Gitlab CI, Sonarqube, Artifactory, etc.)   <br>   <br>* Create an observability architecture for our solutions in order to make them easier to support while they run (log aggregation, monitoring, alerting, etc.)   <br>   <br>* Collaborate with Enterprise Architecture, Engineering Architecture and other architecture leaders to curate and manage best-of-breed solutions to support a DevOps culture   <br>   <br>* Maintain alignment with the industry as new architectures and capabilities within products we currently manage emerge and employ them in a way that improves our solutions   <br>   <br>* Engage with the technical community to collaboratively develop technologies through an inner-source methodology to fuel capability reuse   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Other Attributes:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Has strong focus on business outcomes and is focused on results   <br>   <br>* Subject matter expert in one or more technologies/platforms or highly specialized area(s), and working knowledge of other related domains   <br>   <br>* Is comfortable with open source and understand when a good commercial compliment is available   <br>   <br>* Bachelors degree in Computer Science or a related discipline, at least eight, typically ten or more years of solid, diverse work experience in IT with a minimum of four years experience application program development, or the equivalent in education and work experience.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Technologies:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Terraform   <br>   <br>* AWS   <br>   <br>* Jenkins/Groovy   <br>   <br>* Ansible   <br>   <br>* Openshift/Kubernetes   <br>   <br>* Splunk/Prometheus/Grafana/Alertmanager   <br>   <br>   <br>  </div> </div>",

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>We are now on the lookout for a DevOps Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.&nbsp;</p><p>As DevOps Engineer you will be responsible for ensuring that our different engineering teams have their needs covered when it comes to cross-cutting concerns such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD Pipelines.</p><p>Your deliverables will have a direct impact on the day-to-day work of all our engineers. You will help them reduce the time to market of the tasks and features they are working on. Whilst development and operational efficiency will be your primary goal, you should also have an eye for performant and resilient infrastructures.</p><p>Your responsibilities as DevOps Engineer at BlueLabs will include:</p><ul><li><p>Enable the different teams to deliver and operate their services on their own</p></li><li><p>Be a strong advocate for keeping all things automated and under version control</p></li><li><p>Provide DevOps and SRE expertise and best practices to all developers within the organisation</p></li><li><p>Work hand in hand with the Engineering Leads to execute the company's strategy and assist the development teams when it comes to topics such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD pipelines</p></li><li><p>Be the first point of contact when it comes to cross-cutting concerns, while ensuring that you do not become a single point of failure</p></li></ul><p>BlueLab’s Sports Betting platform consists of tens of microservices written in Elixir, Go and Scala.

Chances are if you’ve ordered directly from a restaurant brand’s app or website, we’ve made that happen. Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption. We’re quite up-front about the technical challenges our business faces. Running a platform with multiple white-labeled front-ends, that maintains real-time connections into thousands of restaurants’ POS systems, and coordinates complex transactions between these and other third parties (such as payment gateways and gift card providers) is not for the faint of heart!   <br>   <br>You’ll be joining our Infrastructure Team, responsible for keeping Olo’s food ordering and delivery systems up and running reliably and securely.   <br>   <br>Our DevOps-oriented team uses Infrastructure-as-Code with automation wherever possible.

We drive continual improvement (kaizen) and are always looking to remove waste, risk or inefficiency from the entire SDLC so that our teams can reach their full potential. Key to this is our adoption of the DevOps mind-set across all stakeholders – not just the development teams!</p><p>In order to realise this strategy, Worldpay runs a centralised team that provide the core DevOps capabilities required by the organisation (the DOCET team). The team designs, builds, tests, releases and supports our CI/CD pipeline which is used by engineering teams to build and deploy production applications to on- and off-premise environments including public clouds (AWS). Containers are a vital part of this architecture.</p><p>Most important of all – we believe that DevOps is a culture, not a team. As such members of the team are expected to evangelise our DevOps capabilities; helping other teams help themselves and always looking to empower stakeholders through self-service tooling. Our vision is a lightning-fast distributed development capability, constantly delivering business value and sharing solutions for the benefit of all.</p><p> <strong>How will you contribute on a day-to-day basis?</strong> </p><p>An opportunity has arisen for a Senior DevOps Engineer to join this team and assist in building the future of Worldpay’s delivery pipeline. You will work alongside other talented engineers to determine how best to meet the requirements of the business, and then turning that into a reliable, scalable and supported pipeline used by agile development teams across different business areas and geographical locations.<br>As a senior member of the team you will be expected to engage with stakeholders, provide technical leadership both within the team and to development teams starting on the DevOps journey, and should expect to take ownership for one or more of the tools that the team support.</p><p> <strong>What will make you the right fit for the team?</strong> </p><p>You will have extensive DevOps engineering and tools experience, as well as solid understanding of DevOps and Middleware implementations. Previous experience in DevOps design, engineering, implementation and support from a financial services organisation is ideal, and you will have experience with many of the following: CI/ CD pipelining, Ansible, Puppet, Chef High Availability and Disaster Recovery, Capacity Planning and Backup, Windows and Linux Administration, Application, Systems and Network Troubleshooting, Runbook Automation and Scripting, Application Performance Monitoring and Root Cause Analysis, Software Development Lifecycle, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Amazon Web Service (AWS), User and Process Documentation, Unit, Performance and Integration Testing.</p><p>You will have the ability to build strong relationships with business and technology stakeholders through open and honest dialogue. Knowledge of payment applications and services are ideal.</p><p> <strong>How is Worldpay changing the world?</strong> </p><p>Worldpay has merged with Vantiv Inc. to create a new global leader in payments. The new Worldpay will have the scale, the reach and the resources to take our success story to another level. This move allows us to expand further into high growth markets, deliver innovation at scale and above all, brings together exceptional talent and a shared passion that will help propel us forward to the next chapter of our collective story.</p><p>Our technology enables billions of payments to be made each year whether online or in person. Working with customers large and small we help them to take payments quickly, safely and reliably, allowing them to grow their businesses and making your life more convenient in the process.</p><p></p>                                                <div>                            <a href='https://www.jobg8.com/Traffic.aspx?VErAys6JIkGU%2bzCmviqJIQb' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>                    </div>                                    </div>",

As the internet’s regulatory landscape fractures around the globe, SaaS providers are increasing subject to strict controls regulating how and where certain information is stored. InCountry - founded by six-time founder Peter Yared -  is building a global, targeted storage and compute network which allows customers to transparently meet data regulations as they are changing around the world.<p>We are seeking senior engineers to join our team to work on a wide range of distributed systems and cloud infrastructure problems. We have technical challenges on a deep stack including: highly available systems and storage, cluster management, global networking, container orchestration, secure systems and key management, performance scaling and API design. Currently our stack is focused around Python and Postgres, but we will introduce Golang and Mongo DB to the stack this year.</p><p>Some key qualifications:</p><p>- Extensive experience with cloud infrastructure, either as a user or builder- Experience up and down the stack- You have carried the pager and operated web systems at scale</p><p>This is a chance to help build critical global infrastructure from the ground up. We are looking for people willing to code and mentor, but who can also write a great design spec. We are growing fast and working in a rapidly changing global landscape, so you should enjoy working fast in the face of ambiguity. The trade-off is autonomy, fast decisions, and big impact. Work wherever you want - InCountry is already a globally distributed team.</p><p>Headquarters is in SF, but we are globally distributed and encourage remote applicants.Apply jobs at incountry.com or <a href='https://www.indeed.com/job/hands-architect-cloud-infrastructure-remote-ok-014a7ac5aae61f12' rel='nofollow'>https://www.indeed.com/job/hands-architect-cloud-infrastruct...</a></p>",

Our vision is a world in which every single human can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. We believe that everyone has the potential to contribute something to our shared knowledge, and that everyone should be able to access that knowledge, free of interference. We host the Wikimedia projects, build software experiences for reading, contributing, and sharing Wikimedia content, support the volunteer communities and partners who make Wikimedia possible, and advocate for policies that enable Wikimedia and free knowledge to thrive.

[Check out our jobs page for more on that](https://skyscrapers.eu/jobs).   <br>   <br>Note that we are looking in the timezones between UTC-4 and UTC+3 to keep things practical.   <br>   <br># Responsibilities   <br> Depending on your specific skill set, passions and desires you’ll be tasked with a combination of any of the following:   <br>   <br>* Support developers in using the platforms we build and making the right decisions   <br>* Providing customers with expertise, guidance and engineering services (as part of ongoing commitments or consulting projects)   <br>* Setting up and maintaining platforms for customers   <br>* Ensure the operational availability, performance and efficiency of the various platforms we build   <br>* Researching, designing and implementing reference architectures and components based on the technologies we use (Kubernetes, serverless, open source)   <br>* Increase the automation of everything we do by codifying operational best practices   <br>* Participate in a (weekly) 24/7 rotation and some other non-24/7 shared roles   <br>* Occasional travel to meet colleagues, attend events and customers.   <br>   <br># Requirements   <br>The expertise and skills we’re looking for:   <br>   <br>* Amazon Web Services architectures for modern web applications (EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, ECS, EKS, S3, etc) holds no secrets for you   <br>* You are a wizard of the clouds employing such spells as infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) and using versioning (GitHub)   <br>* Excellent Linux-fu skills (command line, tools, scripting, networking, etc)   <br>* Ops: troubleshooting and fixing running systems make you feel like a ninja   <br>* Captain of containers: you have hands-on experience with deploying and managing containers   <br>* Modern web-app workflows and architectures makes you warm inside: CI/CD, 12-factor app and containerisation   <br>   <br>The more fluffy things we like (aka soft skills):   <br>   <br>* Excellent communicator using English: well considered, constructive, clear, no-bullshit and transparent communication through text and voice. (don’t worry about your accent, we all have one ;-) )   <br>* Be able to cope with change and ambiguity. You better be ready for that as it is not only a reality in our company but also in the world around us.   <br>* Passionate about technology, cloud and devops: you can't stop learning and have a desire to continuously want to stay on the cutting edge.   <br>* You think independently and take responsibility for the overall success of the organisation and have the maturity to speak your mind in a constructive way.   <br>* You are utmost professional in all the work you do by taking responsibility and delivering quality work at all times.   <br>* Transparency in work and people don’t scare you so we all have the information we need to get things done, grow and support one another.   <br>* You are absolutely respectful of everything and everybody. We embrace diversity.   <br>* Being a teamplayer comes naturally to you. You enjoy participating fully in all team activities and don’t hesitate to support others when needed.   <br>* You strive for wholeness in everything you do, both professionally and personally.   <br>* Be a self-starter: without anybody telling you, you know what to do today, you know where to search for the information you need to learn/get things done and you are not afraid or too proud to ask for help because you can’t possibly know everything.   <br>* Customers (Developers, CTO’s, etc) don’t scare you.

As one of Future’s Senior Site Reliability Engineers you’ll be coordinating a globally distributed team to achieve highly resilient, cost effective distributed service environments. You will be collaborating with our software development teams, key project stakeholders and vendors to ensure our technical delivery aligns with the business strategy.</p><p> You will ensure that all our services meet their availability objectives, and collaborate with the technology teams to build highly resilient services and workflows. An SRE role is similar to a DevOps Engineer role and emphasises our objective to maintain a robust and performant organisation from all aspects of its technical process from CI/CD patterns to routing traffic around failing regions.</p><p> This is a challenging role! You will be supporting our colleagues, ensuring maximum uptime for public services whilst keeping pace with industry trends and acting as a spokesperson for their best practice and adoption.</p><p> Some of your time will be spent on routine ‘Ops’ work such as managing on-call incidents, patching and security checks. When not working on operations tasks you will be working with the Technology teams to improve our service to meet service level objectives, improve service operability and delivering their product objectives.</p><p> To succeed in this role you will be a proficient software developer, with experience in networking, storage, containerisation, and Linux operating systems. This is a complex and ever-changing business so you will need to be able to attend to unfamiliar situations, logically identifying the key aspects to focus upon before working empirically to meet the objectives at hand.</p><p> <strong>Key role responsibilities</strong></p><ul><li>Respond to out of hours incidents as part of a shared rota</li><li>Take ownership of SRE projects and drive them forward</li><li>Be accountable for meeting Futures SLOs</li><li>Collaborate closely with development and project team mates to deliver on our shared goals</li><li>Implement, evolve and maintain runbooks, automation and documentation to improve working practices and system operation</li><li>Attend events, conferences and workshops to maintain awareness of industry trends and support their adoption within the organisation</li><li>Design, build and operate highly resilient, performant and observable infrastructure that serves the changing business objectives</li><li>Collaborate with third-party suppliers and customers where required to support business requirements</li></ul><p><strong>Department Summary</strong></p><p> The SRE position operates within the Technology &amp; Engineering department at Future. We provide the global digital infrastructure and support required to deliver a multitude of high traffic brand websites, ecommerce/content analysis systems, back-office services and advertising services.</p><p> The Engineering team has recently become globally distributed and is providing new challenges and opportunities to our operating model.</p><p> We frequently participate in hackdays, local meetups and larger conferences to ensure our skills are kept sharp and to work with different members of the team.</p><p><strong>What you will need to succeed</strong></p><p>Future’s operating infrastructure is very broad requiring an equally broad set of skills to support. As part of the SRE team you are not expected to be an expert in all fields but to recognise your own strengths and support the group. The principal systems we desire awareness of includes;</p><ul><li>Containerisation and orchestration, eg Kubernetes, Docker-Swarm</li><li>CI/CD practices and tooling such as Jenkins, Gitlab-CI, Spinnaker, ArgoCD</li><li>Observability at scale with tools such as Prometheus, Sensu, CloudWatch</li><li>On-prem and cloud hosting providers (eg XenServer, AWS)</li><li>Automation and Configuration Management tooling such as Ansible, Puppet, Chef, TerraForm</li><li>Development languages such as Python, Ruby or Golang </li></ul><p></p>                                                <div>                            <a href='https://www.jobg8.com/Traffic.aspx?RhEZzU3WQ81UiSFlGL7y3gt' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>                    </div>                                    </div>",

Everything derives from serving our patients.</p><p><strong>Secure, Reliable &amp; Flexible Data</strong></p><p>The features we build generate data. Some of it entirely unique to PeerWell. That data must be securely held, it must be reliably available, and&nbsp;be usable for innovation. We combine our patient data into populations so that we can discover and help predict the direction of patient outcomes, and thereby provide patients&nbsp;with information and guidance to aid their recovery.&nbsp;&nbsp;So building secure, reliable, performative and flexible systems is always a focus.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong></p><p>We seek to make sure our products not only perform but provide an excellent experience along the way. There are many users we serve ranging from patients, to nurses, and doctors, and insurers, and others. We seek to produce defect free software to serve them all, whatever their roles are with respect to the patient.</p><p><strong>Innovation and Appropriate Problem Solving</strong></p><p>We are looking to improve a very large and complex healthcare system. Our approach is through innovations that provide better care, efficiency, and knowledge to all the players.&nbsp; To this end we have created some never seen before innovations using smart-phones alone in the past couple of years, and we aim to do more. For example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Joint Range of Motion</li><li>Exercise Compliance</li><li>in-home Hazard Detection</li></ul><p>Sometimes, we apply well-known solutions and at others when innovation is needed we create something new. The point is, we innovate where it matters and has impact on patients and on the players who serve them.</p><p><strong>Civil Engagement</strong></p><p>We work together, often in different timezones. We expect kind and conscientious engagement with each other. Communication is essential, and honesty key.&nbsp; We are a diverse group of people with a variety of values, and we make it safe for everyone to do their work and express themselves.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Fully Remote Company!

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in.

We spend our time thinking about how to give a global workforce complete control of their own work life while automating the hundreds of thousands of man hours which would normally be required to manage people on this scale.</div><div><br></div><div>We do this using React &amp; Typescript on the frontend backed up by GraphQL servers, some written in Ruby and Rails and some in Elixir and Phoenix.</div><div><br></div><div>Businesses ranging from the largest high-street retailers to five star hotels and independent coffee boutiques rely on Catapult as their casual workforce. If you’ve spent time in a large UK city, you’ve probably been served by a Catapult waiter or sales assistant without even realising it!</div><div><br></div><div>We’re well funded by some amazing investors, our product is live in over 100 locations across the UK and we’ve recently launched in Berlin making us the first and only pan-european player in this space.</div><div><br></div><div>Our company values https://writing.joincatapult.com/our-values/ are really important to us and influence every facet of how we work together.</div><div><br></div><div>As our distributed product organisation grows, we're looking for somebody to help us improve our devops infrastructure and tooling, this includes:</div><div><br></div><div>1. Migrating our CI (gitlab) and feature branch deploys (GKE) to AWS</div><div><br></div><div>2. Upgrading our delivery pipeline for our mobile applications</div><div><br></div><div>3. Creating tooling and documentation to help engineers interact with our infrastructure</div><div><br></div><div>4. Helping us optimise our database infrastructure as we scale</div><div><br></div><div>And probably many other challenges we don't yet know about! You can read more about how we approach engineering with our engineering principles; https://writing.joincatapult.com/engineering-principles/</div><div><br></div><div>For now we're looking for someone to work with us on this 1-3 days a week, we're happy to be flexible on logistics, we could also work on a project basis. We're also flexible on direct employment v contracting depending on situation, location and structure.</div><div><br></div><div><b>About You</b></div><div><br></div><div>You've got deep experience working with AWS but are equally happy working on bare metal or with generic VPS providers like Linode or Digital Ocean. You're comfortable working with Ansible and Terraform and consider anything which isn't fully automated unfinished. You consider DevOps to be a first class value adding field rather than a support function and like to work closely with the rest of the product organisation.</div><div><br></div></div><div><h3> Related Jobs <span><a rel='nofollow'> See more DevOps &amp; Sysadmin jobs<span>→</span></a></span></h3><ul><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Snappy Kraken</span><br><span>Lead Software Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>USA</span></a></li><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Snappy Kraken</span><br><span>AWS Certified SysOps Administrator</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>USA</span></a></li><li><span>New</span><div></div><div><a rel='nofollow'><div></div><span>View company profile</span></a></div><a rel='nofollow'><span>Files.com</span><br><span>Senior Infrastructure Engineer</span><span>featured</span><br><span>Full-Time</span><span>/</span><span>U.S.A.</span></a></li></ul><br></div>",

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p><p>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.

The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p><p>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume. If we believe that you will be a good match, we'll contact you to arrange the next steps.

We believe in change through accountability, debate, ambition and respect for the communities and individuals that make up our networked universe(s).&nbsp;</p><p>Hierarchy is great for maintaining predictability and repeatability. It simplifies planning and makes it easier to control a large group of people from the top down, which is why military organizations, industrial corporations and nation-states have relied on it so heavily. But hierarchies carry their own institutional costs, which means that a regulatory bureaucracy can focus only on a few issues at a time – generally those most important to the people at the top or to the dominant groups in the ruling coalition.</p><p>But what if we can organize this company to embody the very structures of those network communication technologies and digital platforms we hope to build? What if this can enable us to take on all those dinosaur hierarchies as equals - and more than equals? What if self-regulation and social cooperation can be amplified and intensified in this way to empower all of us to care for our selves and ourselves without any authority?</p><p>That’s why Mav Farm is&nbsp;stigmergic. Like the products we build, stigmergy is a form of self-organization social network. It's the principle that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergic networks are superior to hierarchies, in that they are not slowed down by bureaucratic permission-seeking, communication asymmetries and problems associated with top-down coordination. Instead stigmergy allows individual contributors or cells to freely work within a shared platform, contributing to a shared goal as they see fit.</p><p>With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project. The innovations of individual contributors can freely travel throughout the chain when others wish to adopt them. Think of stigmergy as a heuristic approach to improving everything, allowing all of us to be agile and flexible.</p><p>This is our shorthand way of saying that we don’t have any management, and nobody “reports to” anybody else. We do have Founders, but even they aren't your manager. This company is yours to steer—toward opportunities and away from risks, toward high performance and quick creative fixes. You have the power to green-light projects. You have the power to ship products.</p><p>In this stigmergic structure every organizational barrier is removed between your work and the customer enjoying that work. Every company will tell you that “the customer is boss,” but here that statement has weight. There’s no red tape stopping you from figuring out for yourself what our customers want, and then giving it to them.</p><p>So far, our team has designed, architected and built things like: motion tracking in video, object recognition in video, machine learning recommender systems, real-time graphics shaders, AR shopping experiences, business intelligence dashboards, marketplace apps, video streaming apps and more. Our sights are set high!

You should have at least 5 years of professional experience and be able to point to a track record of caring about production systems with significant usage.</li><li>Feel at home with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Linux and shell scripting. You have been working in current cloud-based environments (such as AWS or GCP), but you don’t feel tied to one platform and generally appreciate picking the “right tool for the job.”</li><li>Like to learn and strive to do so often. As a company we improve to the extent that our team does. It starts with each individual. Humility and an open mind help a lot.</li><li>Ideally know what it is like to work in distributed development teams, or better yet, thrive in them. It probably means you already know you don’t need a structured office environment with a manager who checks in on you once a day.

Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love. Customers include Applebee’s, Chili’s, Chipotle, Denny’s, Five Guys Burgers &amp; Fries, Jamba Juice, Noodles &amp; Company, Red Robin, Shake Shack, sweetgreen, Wingstop, and more.</p><p>Olo is located at 26 Broadway in the historic Standard Oil Building, the former home of John D. Rockefeller. &nbsp;We offer great benefits, such as 20 days of Paid Time Off, fully paid health, dental and vision care premiums, stock options, a generous parental leave plan, and perks like FitBits, rotating craft beers on tap in our kitchen, and food events featuring our clients' menu items (now you know why we give out FitBits!).

Running such a platform is not for the faint of heart.</p><p>Mobile ordering and payments is an exciting and active industry, full of interesting players and yet still a relatively untapped market ripe for disruption.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a relatively small team of smart, senior engineers who all get along.&nbsp;</p><p>We're super DevOps oriented and like to automate and build tools for everything. We use Continuous Integration and push frequently.&nbsp;</p><p>We dedicate time to refactoring to reduce technical debt and to introduce newer technologies.

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1) Customized Credit-Improvement Tips: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2) Personalized Money-Saving Advice: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3) Wallet Surveillance: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p><p><strong>How to Apply</strong></p><p>To get our attention, all you need to do is send us a resume.
