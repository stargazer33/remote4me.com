The infrastructures we manage support millions of pounds of transactions every month.</p><p>Working with other Scale Factory colleagues, you'll help to build and support customers' platforms, working with their engineers to put together a foundation of good DevOps practise, helping them move faster, maintain uptime, and keep their secrets safe and secure.</p><p>Most of our work centres around ReadyScale, our platform design for scalable cloud infrastructure.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;deployed&nbsp;on AWS using Terraform and Puppet. We're currently building out a next generation ReadyScale architecture&nbsp;based on&nbsp;Kubernetes.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Attitude, flexibility, and the ability to learn new technologies quickly, are all more important than years of experience. However you'll need production experience with:</p><ul><li>AWS</li><li>Linux (either CentOS or Ubuntu)</li><li>Automation tools</li></ul><p>Experience with the following would also be beneficial, but not required: Jenkins, Terraform, Packer, ELK, Vagrant, Prometheus, Docker, Kubernetes. As dictated by client requirements, we work with a number of different language environments&nbsp;and application frameworks.</p><p>Honestly, if you're not sure if you have the relevant experience for this job, get in touch anyway and we'll figure it out together.</p><p><strong>Other</strong></p><p>The salary range listed here is indicative - we'll make you an offer based on your location and experience.</p><p>We're not looking to work with&nbsp;recruiters&nbsp;to fill this role.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://the-scale-factory.workable.com/jobs/57204/candidates/new' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About The Scale Factory</h3>            <div><p>The Scale Factory is a growing London-based consultancy. We design, build, operate, support and scale Linux infrastructure for clients of various sizes, across a number of business sectors.</p><p>We have an office near London Bridge, but we support remote working as long as you're within the UK; we encourage our team to make their own schedule with the hours that work best for them. That said, client visits (mostly London, but sometimes further afield) will occasionally be necessary, and some client engagements will influence the hours you'll need to be available - but most are pretty flexible around this too.</p><p>As well as monthly co-working days (one in London, one in Manchester), we bring the whole team together every couple of months for planning sessions, hack days, and socialising. We try to ensure that our social time is balanced and inclusive: we'll sometimes play board games in the office instead of just defaulting to&nbsp;a visit to the pub (though we do that from time to time too!)</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>25 days holiday per year</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>High spec Macbook or Thinkpad</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Budget for conference attendance (incl. international travel)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Culture of inclusivity</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Group life protection &amp; critical illness cover scheme</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Mixture of on-site and remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Friendly colleagues, with a wealth of experience to share</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours to suit you</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Training and development opportunities</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Olo is a pioneer in the industry, beginning with text message ordering on mobile feature phones in 2005. Today, millions of consumers use Olo to order ahead (SKIP THE LINE®) or get meals delivered from the restaurants they love.

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Our mission is to use these solutions to power the emerging economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet.</p><p>Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, security and infrastructure, and more. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us. </p><p>The role:</p><p>Are you looking for the next frontier and challenge where you can apply your expertise in penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, and threat modeling?  Smart contracts are programs on a blockchain: they never go down, cannot be changed, and run as programmed.  These smart contracts directly control money, so you can see that their security is critical.</p><p>ConsenSys is a development pioneer of the Ethereum ecosystem and many of our tools such as Truffle, INFURA, MetaMask, BlockApps, are among the most widely adopted globally.  With ConsenSys Enterprise, we have been delivering blockchain software solutions to major global institutions for the past two years.</p><p>ConsenSys is expanding its efforts on smart contract security to meet the needs of enterprise clients as well as home-grown platforms ranging from prediction markets to decentralized crowdfunding, including uPort, Gnosis, Stabl, WeiFund, and Virtue Poker.  Our aim is to build the most technically-gifted and engineering-focused blockchain security team.</p><p>We are looking to hire someone with a passion for Solidity, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and security.  Candidates should relish in technical subtleties and minutiae, and have a passion for combining them with a flair for creativity and insight to hack smart contracts.</p><p>A significant part of the work can be done remotely wherever you are; little travel is anticipated (most of the technical team works remotely around the world). There's also opportunity to stay ahead of demand and lead and build out this team in case that's also of interest. This will be an engineering-first development organization, with the autonomy to manage itself in a manner conducive to software development excellence. It will be rigorous, demanding and not for everyone. We are looking for exceptionally intellectual, bright and technically driven individuals. We will be addressing challenges that have not been encountered before while borrowing from patterns in previous software architectures.</p><p>Qualifications</p><p>Minimum qualifications:</p><p>1 year demonstrated expertise with Solidity, the EVM, and blockchain</p><p>3 years of relevant work experience.</p><p>BS degree in a relevant field or equivalent practical experience.</p><p>Coding/scripting experience in one or more general purpose languages.</p><p>Preferred qualification:</p><p>Demonstrated expertise and contributions towards smart contract security, EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals), or research.</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience analyzing the security of systems (penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, etc.).</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience, including experience in responding to security problems in target-rich environments, looking at security alerts, front-line analysis and response.</p><p>Programming experience in Python, C/C++, Java, or Go.</p><p>Advanced degree (MS, PhD) in relevant field is a plus.</p><p>Who We are, some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:</p><p>The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society. We believe that there is an opportunity to bring the remaining 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy and to radically transform our society for the enrichment of humankind.</p><p>A dynamic startup environment with runway. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization. At ConsenSys, the runway allows you to focus on what you do best without worrying about the runway.</p><p>Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new technologies, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</p><p>Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much work to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users. </p><p>ConsenSys was just named a Top 100 FinTech company by KPMG's 2016 Fintech Innovators report.</p></div>",

We currently do this by giving regulated businesses the tools they need to automate and digitalise the onboarding, verification and management of their customers - that means customers can be onboarded in real-time, without ever having met in person. <br /><br />And this is just the beginning - our technology allows us to define what ‘trust’ means across the digital economy. Our long term aim is to create a single network where people and businesses can share their digital identity securely and interchangeably - whether they’re applying for a mortgage, listing on the stock market, or applying for a new job. We're transforming how trust is established online, in the same way that Salesforce transformed sales, Stripe transformed payments and AWS transformed DevOps.<br /><br />What you’ll be doing<br /><br />Having just closed Series A, we’re looking for a DevOps engineer to help us solve the exciting infrastructure challenges that come along with significant growth. We’re a critical part of our client’s infrastructure, and we therefore need to build and manage our production environments for performance, reliability and high availability.

Our application utilises a microservices architecture, and is built within python and rust.<br />You’ll also be experimenting with new technologies, across our stack. You’ll work with the data team to pick the best tooling for warehousing and ETLs, as well as constantly investigating tools to help manage our core platform.<br /><br />What we’re looking for<br /><br />* 5+ years experience building scalable infrastructure including experience with<br />Kubernetes and Docker<br />* Production experience on Google Cloud<br />* Microservices architecture, complex distributed systems<br />* Passionate about infrastructure and delivery for short and long term goals<br />* Able to maintain services by measuring and monitoring availability, performance and overall health<br />* Great people skills to engage and empower software developers to build and deliver their services<br /><br />The Perks<br /><br />* Equity! We want you to succeed as we do<br />* Great location - we’re central to three stations, and sandwiched between Brick Lane and Spitalfields market<br />* An annual learning & development budget to spend on professional or personal development, we’re invested in both<br />* Birthday off - relax and put your feet up<br />* Dental cover<br />* Access to Perkbox - discounts to services and products (and honestly it’s fantastic)<br />* Equally Enhanced Maternity/Paternity/Shared Leave pay <br />* Generous holiday entitlement<br />* Pension contributions - investing in your future is important<br />* Pick your own equipment and kit<br />* Biscuits… we’re a bit obsessed.

We’re less interested in conforming to a specific title, and more interested in a passion for using systems and infrastructure to help build a great product.<br><br>Regardless of title, the following are core responsibilities:<br>* Manage and improve our AWS infrastructure, implementing best practices, evaluating AWS offerings, and deploying infrastructure resources.<br>* Develop processes to scale and automate our infrastructure using container-based systems.<br>* Monitoring hundreds of instances: database servers, API servers, custom servers... you name it!<br>* Reduce barriers for engineers to deploy and optimize systems.<br><br>In addition, there’s room to make a major impact in multiple areas:<br>* Help optimize for security, speed, and redundancy across all points of the AWS stack.<br>* Build tools and processes to help us detect and respond to operational issues more quickly.<br>* Increase performance visibility by working on our metrics and logging infrastructure.<br>* Improve and optimize resource monitoring and emergency response handling.<br><br>We’re not expecting expertise in each category.

Ultimately we’re looking for someone who has a passion for quickly leveraging and optimizing new technology, implementing best practices, and building world-class systems at scale.<br><br>**Our stack**<br>* AWS - we’ve drunk the kool-aid and use AWS across the board.<br>* Salt, Sensu, Graylog, Elasticsearch - provisioning, monitoring, and logging<br>* Node.js - APIs and backend development<br>* Kubernetes, Docker, ECS - tentative container exploration<br>* MariaDB, MongoDB, Solr, Redis - data persistence<br>* Github, Jenkins, Ghost Inspector, Mocha - deployment and testing<br><br>**How we work**<br>* Execute: this isn't a management position. This means you'll be executing your craft and shipping improvements every day.<br>* Contribute: we want our engineers to make an impact on the Knack product. This means you're not just implementing other’s specifications. You’re developing ideas, making suggestions, and keeping on top of new tech to understand opportunities.<br>* Engage: we expect a high level of engagement with decision-making, specifications, and consensus. You'll be expected to propose ideas, defend them, and contribute feedback to others.<br>* Learn and grow: we do code-reviews, pair-programming, lunch-and-learns, and use every opportunity to teach and learn.<br><br>**Remote**<br>Our work is 100% remote. We use GitHub, Slack, Trello, Google Docs and Google Hangouts to get our work done. As a remote company we optimize around asynchronous communication. We also realize that in-person communication is often going to be the most effective means to get something done.<br><br>**About You**<br>Above all, you build things. You have a history of starting --and completing-- projects, whether that’s products, applications, games, libraries, or plugins.<br><br>You’re both a teacher and a learner. You’re not afraid to admit when someone may know more than you. You have the confidence to help others level up.<br><br>You’re an outstanding communicator. You can document a problem, and clearly and succinctly outline a solution. You’re not afraid to distill things into plain English for teammates and customers.<br><br>You have experience working in fast-paced environments, prioritizing and balancing multiple projects, and working with cross-functional teams.<br><br>You want to work on a product you can be proud of that impacts thousands of people all over the world, from non-profits to the world’s biggest companies.<br><br>You go all in. You want to do your best work, and have that work make an impact.<br><br>**This isn’t for everyone, but for the right fit this will be the definitive experience of your career.

You will hear “What’s my login?” one trillion times, and you will have to say, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” with a straight face.<br /> <br />It’s not rocket science, which is why this helpdesk support role pays 30k not 300k, but we’ll throw in contributions to gym membership and a share of your first year’s new orders revenue.<br /> <br />You’ll be dealing with clients’ issues, from the first ticket to resolution. And, of course, you’ll be dealing with dummies who think toolkits are what Dad keeps in the garage, and who don’t know networks from nachos. That’s pretty much all you’ll do, day in, day out, so if you’d rather eat your own face than be polite to people every damn day, stop reading.<br /> <br />Still here? Cool. We also need you to document every step. So explain stuff to clients, and write it down. Officially, this is “retaining system knowledge”. Really it’s so when someone deletes the wrong thing and plunges of Europe into darkness, you can prove you didn’t tell ’em to do it.<br /> <br />To sum up so far:<br /><br />• Answer the damn phone or email, log the damn tickets and help the damn client.<br /><br />• Don’t swear or say stuff like “hybrid cloud” unless you want to freak them out.<br /><br />• Prioritise. If someone says, “I’ve deleted the wrong thing and plunged half of Europe into darkness,” put ’em ahead of someone whose Instagram is freezing.<br /><br />• Pass the buck. No, really. If you can’t resolve the issue, escalate it to Sales, Accounts, Management or upper line support. None of them will thank you for this, so buy them drinks when we go out, even though all of them will be paid more than you.<br /><br />• Maintain a knowledge base and suggest ideas for improvement. Keep these work-related for the probation period, then try asking for at-desk massages and in-house baristas. You won’t get them, but it’ll be slightly harder for us to fire you.<br /> <br />Don’t bother applying unless you have, or can convincingly lie about having:<br /><br />• one year’s experience on a technical and client-focused support desk.<br /><br />• one year’s customer service experience in any sector.<br /><br />• a logical approach to resolving functional and technical issues.<br /><br />• the ability to assess and document client issues, user experiences and processes.<br /><br />• a professional phone and email manner.<br /><br />• the ability to talk to people at different levels, with diverse backgrounds, without sighing or asking if they were dropped on their head as a baby.<br /><br />• experience of being accountable in a small team and the ability to work independently.<br /><br />• understanding of data protection and compliance principles, namely GDPR.<br /> <br />We need you to be organized, systematic, a good communicator, a problem-solver, proactive, reliable and able to prioritise. You need to know the Microsoft Office suite too – but, let’s face it, even your grandma can work Outlook, Word and Excel these days.<br /> <br />If you can do all that, you’re halfway through the door. If you can do all that, and you have experience of MS SharePoint (2010 and 2013), Zendesk, Targetprocess, remote assistance software and support portals, and conceptualising system frameworks and impacts, maybe those massages and baristas will happen.*<br /><br />*They won’t.<br /><br />Interested? please send us a CV and be sure to include a covering letter. That's right you don't go fishing without a hook. We look forward to hearing from you.",

    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Operations* *Associate*.<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />As Operations Associate you will be responsible for solving a wide range of business-critical logistical, technical and relationship management challenges. We are a company built on a strong technical foundation, which you will need to learn and understand. You’ll need to grasp and effectively manage a range of data sets, technology platforms and human complexity. Most importantly you will need initiative and drive.<br /><br />The role combines stakeholder management and a continuous requirement to solve new and complex operational problems. You will play an integral part in the delivery of Switchee services to our large social housing customers and the communities they house; you will work across fulfilment from our manufacturing partners, installer support, IoT fleet management, product testing and customer project management and delivery.<br /><br />The work will entail close collaboration with other operations functions as well as our sales and customer success and development teams. As an early joiner to the Operations team, at a time of high growth, you will play an important role in supporting the Head of Operations in designing the build out of our whole Operations capability.<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />* Administer the suite of Switchee operations and device management platforms<br />* Support in overseeing, sequencing and auditing the of delivery of customer orders all over the UK, in co-ordination with our UK based manufacturing partner<br />* Report on, troubleshoot and diagnose any in-field device outages<br />* Work with our development team to design and implement tests for both our hardware and software<br />* Produce bespoke client reports and analytics<br />* Contribute to the wider development of the business by inputting into the development of our internal systems and process<br />* Be responsible for the overall quality control of your areas of service delivery<br />* Support sales and customer success by delivering exceptional results and reacting quickly in a complex operating environment<br />* Understand that blockers may be cultural/behavioural as well as technical and thrive in finding solutions to these<br />* Contribute to the growth of Switchee by building long-term commercial relationships with our commercial partners, especially contractors and installers<br />* Support on handling user issues in the field<br /><br /><br />*Your* *experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places and we encourage graduate-level applicants.<br /><br />Required skills and experience:<br /><br />* Excellent communication and interpersonal skills<br />* Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience<br />* Strong analytical & numeracy skills with complete command of Excel or equivalent statistical software package<br />* Proven ability to develop and implement effective solutions to complex commercial problems<br />* Be process and solutions orientated<br />* A very high attention to detail and a love of learning fast under pressure<br />* An ability to feel comfortable collaborating with people of all levels and backgrounds.<br />* Be able to grasp, handle and communicate technical concepts effectively.<br /><br /><br />Desirable skills and experience<br /><br />Between 1-2 years’ experience in operations or a similar commercial field<br />Fluency with large data sets and an ability to interrogate them for commercial insight<br />Experience in putting in place and handling processes required to manage and deliver large operational projects<br /><br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market.<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems.<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We occasionally work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter via our website.",
