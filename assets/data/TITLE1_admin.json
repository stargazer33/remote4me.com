We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.</p><p>We're a semi-stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.</p><p>Our team is composed of neuro-experts, open-source enthusiasts, audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going (but dedicated!) folks.</p><p>About You:</p><p>- You're excited to design a service architecture that orthogonalizes the critical feedback loops that entangle our code, data, models, and products.</p><p>- You're tired of organizations treating DevOps like an individual role instead of a company-wide practice.</p><p>- You're a networks/containers nerd who will turn us into networks/containers nerds.</p><p>- You've witnessed the pains that result from fitting square AWS-provided-solution pegs into round in-house-problem holes. Conversely, you've also seen how NIH syndrome can drive teams down a rabbit hole whose endpoint is a shallow reproduction of an existing AWS solution that could've just been employed in the first place.</p><p>- You are familiar with the many idiosyncrasies of storing, streaming, and analyzing large volumes of dense signal data in the cloud (e.g. audio, video, domain-specific sensor data, etc.).</p><p>- You believe that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture, and that lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.</p><p>Our data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. This quarter, we're tackling model evaluation as a CI process, pushing &gt;70TB of signal data (and our processes for manipulating it) into AWS, and developing a browser-based viewing/analysis application for our signal data.

We believe that our experience paired with today’s technologies, great talent and the agility of a startup environment will enable us to deliver a best-in-class product that meets the demands of the market of tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>We are now on the lookout for a Lead DevOps Engineer who wants to join our distributed team and help us execute our vision.&nbsp;</p><p>As DevOps Engineer you will be responsible for ensuring that our different engineering teams have their needs covered when it comes to cross-cutting concerns such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD Pipelines.</p><p>Your deliverables will have a direct impact on the day-to-day work of all our engineers. You will help them reduce the time to market of the tasks and features they are working on. Whilst development and operational efficiency will be your primary goal, you should also have an eye for performant and resilient infrastructures.</p><p>Your responsibilities as DevOps Engineer at BlueLabs will include:</p><ul><li><p>Enable the different teams to deliver and operate their services on their own</p></li><li><p>Be a strong advocate for keeping all things automated and under version control</p></li><li><p>Provide DevOps and SRE expertise and best practices to all developers within the organisation</p></li><li><p>Work hand in hand with the Engineering Leads to execute the company's strategy and assist the development teams when it comes to topics such as Infrastructure, Security, Instrumentation and CI/CD pipelines</p></li><li><p>Be the first point of contact when it comes to cross-cutting concerns, while ensuring that you do not become a single point of failure</p></li></ul><p>BlueLab’s Sports Betting platform consists of tens of microservices written in Elixir, Go and Scala. You are not required to have professional experience with either of these languages but being interested in them will be valued positively, since it will help you better understand the needs of our Engineering teams.</p><p><strong>Remote Work</strong></p><p>We are hiring for talent, not for a specific location. You will find that members of our team are distributed all over Europe. Being a distributed team enables us to hire only the best, without being restricted to the talent pool available at a specific geographic location. However, to facilitate team communication and collaboration we currently require you to be located in a European time zone (between UTC-1 and UTC+3). You must also be able to travel to other European locations a few times a year for on-site meetings and workshops.</p><p><strong>Compensation</strong></p><p>The base compensation range for this role is €65k-90k annually, depending on your background and experience. It can be subject to an adjustment of up to 15% in either direction if the cost-of-living in your region is far above or below the European average.

More specifically, we are harnessing the power of data analytics and artificial intelligence to build the brain of a smart financial advisor, whose services we’re offering to everyone for free. The WalletHub brain enables users to make better financial decisions in a fraction of the time with three unique features:</p><p>1)&nbsp;<strong>Customized Credit-Improvement Tips</strong>: WalletHub identifies improvement opportunities and guides you through the necessary corrections.</p><p>2)&nbsp;<strong>Personalized Money-Saving Advice</strong>: WalletHub’s savings brain constantly scours the market for load-lightening opportunities, bringing you only the best deals.</p><p>3)&nbsp;<strong>Wallet Surveillance</strong>: Personal finance isn’t as scary with 24/7 credit monitoring providing backup, notifying you of important credit-report changes.</p><p>In addition to the valuable intelligence the brain provides, WalletHub is the first and only service to offer free credit scores and full credit reports that are updated on a daily basis absent of user interaction, rather than weekly or monthly and only when a user logs in. Some other services hang their hats on free credit scores and reports, yet they’re still inferior to what WalletHub considers minor pieces to a much larger puzzle.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/305949?reset=False&amp;ra=1EByIsq28mxa&amp;oqs=a%3D1EByIsq28mxa%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>            <h4>About Wallethub</h4>            <div><p>WalletHub helps all consumers reach top financial fitness by providing:<br><br>• Free credit scores and credit reports that are updated on a daily basis.<br><br>• Free 24/7 credit monitoring and personalized advice that will help you improve your credit and save money. <br><br>• More reviews on financial products, professionals and companies than any other website.<br><br>• An extensive education center coupled with the ability to ask financial experts your money-related questions for free .</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work visa sponsorship</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from home</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We’re committed to&nbsp;diversity and inclusion, and our common goal is to democratize publishing so that anyone with a story can tell it, regardless of income, gender, politics, language, or where they live in the world.</p><p>We believe in Open Source&nbsp;and the vast majority of our work is available under the GPL.</p><p>We strive to live by the&nbsp;Automattic Creed: <a href='https://automattic.com/creed' rel='nofollow'>https://automattic.com/creed</a>.</p><p>Come&nbsp;work with us.</p><p><strong>How We Work</strong></p><p><strong>Choose your own adventure</strong>&nbsp;· Everyone works from the location they choose. We’re spread out all over the world in more than 60 countries. We track about 70 percent of our projects on&nbsp;P2-themed&nbsp;WordPress.com blogs, 25 percent in private chat rooms, and the rest on Slack. Because of the geographic variance, we’re active 24/7. We care about the work you produce, not just the hours you put&nbsp;in.</p><p><strong>Coming on board</strong>&nbsp;· When you make it past the interview stage we’ll do a project together on contract, typically lasting between two to six weeks depending on how much time you can spend, to see how we work together (learn more about our&nbsp;global hiring guidelines). When you join full-time, you’ll do customer support for WordPress.com for your first two weeks and spend a week in support annually, for evermore, regardless of your position. We believe an early and ongoing connection with the people who use our products is irreplaceable. (If you’re applying for an engineering position, you can&nbsp;learn more about the process you can expect.)</p><p><strong>Meeting up</strong>&nbsp;· We get the whole company together once a year for seven days so that Automatticians can create bonds that influence them all year long. So far we’ve done Grand Meetups in San Francisco, California; La Paz, Mexico; Oracle, Arizona; Breckenridge, Colorado; Mont-Sainte-Anne, Québec; Seaside, Florida; Budapest, Hungary; San Diego, California; Santa Cruz, California;&nbsp;Park City, Utah; and Whistler, Canada.</p><p>In addition to our all-company Grand Meetup, teams meet for five to seven days to brainstorm team-level strategy and bond in locales ranging from Boulder to Buenos Aires, Las Vegas to Lisbon, Montréal to Mexico City, and Vienna to Vietnam. If you join our merry band, expect to travel three to four weeks per&nbsp;year.</p><p><strong>Diversity and Inclusion</strong>&nbsp;· In 2014 we started to work, as a company, on facilitating spaces for discussions about diversity at Automattic. And at the 2016 Grand Meetup with all of our employees across 50 countries, we decided to share with the rest of the world&nbsp;what we are doing about diversity and inclusion.</p><p><strong>What do we look for?&nbsp;</strong>· Automatticians are curious, driven, compassionate, tenacious, autonomous, friendly, independent, collaborative, communicative, supportive, self-motivated, and amazing with GIFs. We strive to live up to&nbsp;the Automattic Creed&nbsp;and we want to work with people who will do the same. Are you interested in making the web and the world a better place? Apply today.</p><p><strong>Our Development Process</strong></p><p><strong>Data-informed, user-driven&nbsp;·</strong>&nbsp;For every feature we launch, we gather metrics about its usage, interaction, and growth in addition to listening to the masses of feedback we get on our blog and through support channels. This helps us inform decisions about new features and enhancements. It’s not uncommon to launch a feature and then iterate immediately.</p><p><strong>Diversity &amp; Inclusion At Automattic</strong><br><br>We’re improving diversity in the tech industry. At Automattic, we want people to love their work and show respect and empathy to all. We welcome differences and strive to increase participation from traditionally underrepresented groups. Our D&amp;I committee involves Automatticians across the company and drives grassroots change. For example, this group has helped facilitate private online spaces for affiliated Automatticians to gather and helps run a monthly D&amp;I People Lab series for further learning. Diversity and Inclusion is a priority at Automattic, though our dedication influences far more than just Automatticians: We make our products freely available and translate our products into and offer customer support in numerous languages. We require unconscious bias training for our hiring teams and ensure our products are accessible across different bandwidths and devices.&nbsp;Read more about our dedication to&nbsp;diversity and inclusion:&nbsp;<a href='https://automattic.com/diversity-and-inclusion/' rel='nofollow'>https://automattic.com/diversity-and-inclusion</a></p>            </div>        ",

This wealth of performance data is made available to the public through Grafana dashboards and open datasets. We are looking to complement the team’s wide area of expertise with a person who has in-depth knowledge of system-level performance (Linux kernel, containers).</p><p>We strive to be the performance standard bearer in the Foundation and the Wikimedia community. We aim to be visible in the performance community and work to influence others and bring learnings to the team.</p><p>Wikipedia and its sister projects are themselves powered by Free and Open Source software with MediaWiki at their core, surrounded by an ecosystem of services in PHP, Node.js, and Python. The web traffic is served from geographically distributed caching clusters powered by Varnish and Apache Traffic Server.</p><p>If you find what we do interesting, and you are excited by improving the reliability and delivery of one of the Internet’s top 10 websites, you might be just the person we need.

But we&rsquo;re also a team of dedicated (self-proclaimed) nerds, tech is what we know and love. So, we have combined these two drives and created a product we can be proud of.</p><br /><p>The idea is that peace of mind about a loved one&rsquo;s wellbeing should be at people&rsquo;s fingertips no matter who or where they are. To do this, we created a wearable device and 11 sensors that can be placed around someone&rsquo;s home. Each sensor picks up information about a key activity. This means looking at drinking and eating habits, toilet usage, sleep patterns and heart rate (approximately 5,000 data points). These sensors collect data that our AI then analyses for any patterns of decline in wellbeing. When we start to notice that something isn&rsquo;t looking ideal, we send caregivers notifications so they can address problems before they escalate.</p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Check us out:</p><br /><p><a href='https://www.mysense.ai/'>https://www.mysense.ai</a></p><br /><p><a href='https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense'>https://www.linkedin.com/company/mysense</a></p><br /><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We are an equal opportunities employer and welcome applications from all suitably qualified persons regardless of their race, sex, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation or age.</p>",
