We&nbsp;work&nbsp;with customers across a number of sectors, including e-commerce, media, healthcare, and&nbsp;fintech. The infrastructures we manage support millions of pounds of transactions every month.</p><p>Working with other Scale Factory colleagues, you'll help to build and support customers' platforms, working with their engineers to put together a foundation of good DevOps practise, helping them move faster, maintain uptime, and keep their secrets safe and secure.</p><p>Most of our work centres around ReadyScale, our platform design for scalable cloud infrastructure.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;deployed&nbsp;on AWS using Terraform and Puppet. We're currently building out a next generation ReadyScale architecture&nbsp;based on&nbsp;Kubernetes.</p><p><strong>Skills &amp; Requirements</strong></p><p>Attitude, flexibility, and the ability to learn new technologies quickly, are all more important than years of experience. However you'll need production experience with:</p><ul><li>AWS</li><li>Linux (either CentOS or Ubuntu)</li><li>Automation tools</li></ul><p>Experience with the following would also be beneficial, but not required: Jenkins, Terraform, Packer, ELK, Vagrant, Prometheus, Docker, Kubernetes. As dictated by client requirements, we work with a number of different language environments&nbsp;and application frameworks.</p><p>Honestly, if you're not sure if you have the relevant experience for this job, get in touch anyway and we'll figure it out together.</p><p><strong>Other</strong></p><p>The salary range listed here is indicative - we'll make you an offer based on your location and experience.</p><p>We're not looking to work with&nbsp;recruiters&nbsp;to fill this role.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://the-scale-factory.workable.com/jobs/57204/candidates/new' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About The Scale Factory</h3>            <div><p>The Scale Factory is a growing London-based consultancy. We design, build, operate, support and scale Linux infrastructure for clients of various sizes, across a number of business sectors.</p><p>We have an office near London Bridge, but we support remote working as long as you're within the UK; we encourage our team to make their own schedule with the hours that work best for them. That said, client visits (mostly London, but sometimes further afield) will occasionally be necessary, and some client engagements will influence the hours you'll need to be available - but most are pretty flexible around this too.</p><p>As well as monthly co-working days (one in London, one in Manchester), we bring the whole team together every couple of months for planning sessions, hack days, and socialising. We try to ensure that our social time is balanced and inclusive: we'll sometimes play board games in the office instead of just defaulting to&nbsp;a visit to the pub (though we do that from time to time too!)</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>25 days holiday per year</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>High spec Macbook or Thinkpad</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Budget for conference attendance (incl. international travel)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Culture of inclusivity</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Group life protection &amp; critical illness cover scheme</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Mixture of on-site and remote work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Friendly colleagues, with a wealth of experience to share</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours to suit you</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Training and development opportunities</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

This involves a lot of really cool software (mostly written in a mix of Python and Go, and with user-facing tools in PHP and Javascript) that helps us make magical features at all layers of the traditional hosting stack: distributed and redundant storage, automated container orchestration, highly-available applications and services, fast creation and replication of environments, etc.</p><p>The company is entirely distributed with an HQ in Paris that 10-15% of the company works out of.

How do we define Hazelcast the company?</p><p>Immediately when you use the product, you notice that it is simple to use, that the code has been provided under an open source license and other details. Hazelcast nodes join together to form a cluster that is more powerful than any individual node. These qualities go beyond the Hazelcast project and are the basis for the culture of the company.</p><p><strong>OUR FOUNDER:</strong></p><p>Talip Ozturk, founder of Hazelcast describing 111:</p><p>I created Hazelcast 111 to define the unique “kernel” of Hazelcast company culture that is designed to scale as the company grows.</p><p>Hazelcast&nbsp;111&nbsp;(one-eleven) is the cultural&nbsp;”source code” for the company. The name is derived from the idea that&nbsp;1 + 1 + 1 can equal more than 3, that together we can be much more&nbsp;powerful than we are alone.These principles are expected to govern the professional behavior of&nbsp;Hazelcast team members and set expectations with the greater Hazelcast&nbsp;community about what they can expect when working with our team. New team members will be interviewed for cultural fit and we strive to make Hazelcast a great place to work for those who share these&nbsp;principles.</p><p><strong>111 PRINCIPLES:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Quality</strong></p><p><strong>Strive for work products that are reliable, stable and free of defects</strong></p><p><strong>2. Positivity</strong></p><p><strong>Solve problems or communicate about them in a constructive way.</strong></p><p><strong>3. Scalable Thinking</strong></p><p><strong>Make things work well as they scale up or down.</strong></p><p><strong>4. Bias Towards Simplicity</strong></p><p><strong>Try to make things as simple as possible.</strong></p><p><strong>5. Humility</strong></p><p><strong>Assume other Hazelcast community members are smart.</strong></p><p><strong>Give credit to the ideas and work of others first.</strong></p><p><strong>6. Honesty</strong></p><p><strong>Say what needs to be said even if it is difficult. Have hard conversations.</strong></p><p><strong>7. Ownership</strong></p><p><strong>Own your projects. Deliver on time.</strong></p><p><strong>Coordinate with anything that delivery depends on</strong></p><p><strong>Escalate when you are stuck</strong></p><p><strong>8. Community Focus</strong></p><p><strong>Seek to improve the lives of Hazelcast team members, customers and users.</strong></p><p><strong>9. Commitment</strong></p><p><strong>Participate in the decision process</strong></p><p><strong>Contribute to success even if you disagreed with the decision outcome</strong></p><p><strong>FEELS GOOD<br></strong></p><p>The correct implementation of&nbsp;111&nbsp;FEELS GOOD to team members, customers, partners, investors and open source users of Hazelcast. The test of&nbsp;111&nbsp;is whether it feels good. If it does not feel good, we need to improve either or both of our implementation or specification of&nbsp;111.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical, Dental and Vision Plans</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Commuter Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Savings Accounts (HSA)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Employee Assistance Program (EAP)</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Life Insurance, Voluntary Benefits, etc.</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Our users are real estate developers, homebuilders, and sales agencies that use Lasso to convert prospects to purchasers and sell their developments faster and easier.</p><p>We have experienced consistent growth during the last decade and our user base asks a lot of our system. Scale, reliability, and innovation keep us learning on daily basis. You will join our server-side team to enhance and maintain our server-side Java 8 and Kotlin applications.</p><p>We have distributed systems hosted in AWS, which are presented to our users through an AngularJS frontend.</p><p>Moving forward, the biggest challenge we face is scaling our systems to work with a large dataset and high system load. You’ll help us build systems that can easily scale up and down the number of processing nodes as needed and implement rate-limiting to ensure rogue systems don’t impact our SLAs for other applications.</p><p>Additionally, you’ll improve the performance of our main data store by adding or changing indexes as appropriate, add caching functionality where possible and set up monitoring to catch performance bottlenecks early on.</p><p><strong>Culture and Work Environment</strong></p><p>As a fully remote team, communication is extremely important - there is no chance to drop in on interesting discussions around the water cooler or to see if someone is busy just by glancing at their desk.</p><p>We have systems to signal busy-ness; regular meetings and stand-ups to disseminate information, frequent one-on-ones to ensure there are no frustrations building up, a code of conduct and a formal complaint process to resolve conflicts early-on.</p><p>You thrive in a self-directed and open work environment. There’s no boss breathing down your neck, no deadlines, no fixed work hours and no in-office requirements. It’s really important that you can manage your time well, and you know what you need in order to do your job well (e.g. what work hours to pick so you have enough time to communicate with team members effectively)</p><p><strong>As a key member of our server-side team, you’ll specifically be expected to:</strong></p><ul><li>Design and build API endpoints for our internal and public APIs</li><li>Architect efficient task scheduling and processing systems</li><li>Keep up-to-date on new AWS features and integrate them into our tech stack if appropriate</li><li>Work closely with the Director of Engineering to adapt and develop our architecture and systems</li><li>Implement monitoring systems for performance bottlenecks on our main data store</li><li>Determine through performance profiling where to add caching to our distributed systems and internal interfaces</li><li>Monitor the growth of our datasets and assist in creating strategies to address the systems where growth could become an issue</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>Deep knowledge of the OOP paradigm, experience with functional programming and other approaches is a plus</li><li>Experience building complex systems with many moving parts, such as different protocols, varying restrictions on latency or CAP parameters</li><li>Knowledge of common logging and CI tools, at least on an abstract level</li><li>Excellent knowledge of static type systems and compiled languages</li><li>Deep knowledge of various data stores such as SQL, document stores, key-value stores or queuing systems, as well as their performance characteristics and scalability issues</li><li>Good understanding of caching and cache invalidation strategies</li></ul><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li>Work where and how you are most productive</li><li>You are not required to be in the office. Start time and work times are flexible</li><li>We’ll provide a development setup of your choosing, whether it’s a MacBook Pro or the components for a nice PC tower, you can pick whatever works best for you</li><li>Pick your own tools. We use what we know best. Windows, Mac, Linux, whatever you like</li><li>We provide you with a tools budget that you can use to make yourself productive ($300 per purchase, no authorization needed)</li><li>We know learning is a must on and off the job. We provide formal education matching (up to $1500 yearly) and funding for other continued learning, conferences, and workshops</li><li>Medical and Dental benefits</li><li>Great Vancouver-market salary</li></ul><p><strong>Interested?</strong></p><p>Lasso’s vision is to be the technology hub for new home sales in North America by providing a unique combination of remarkable software and expert services.

    "content": "We won’t lie. You will hear “What’s my login?” one trillion times, and you will have to say, “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” with a straight face.<br /> <br />It’s not rocket science, which is why this helpdesk support role pays 30k not 300k, but we’ll throw in contributions to gym membership and a share of your first year’s new orders revenue.<br /> <br />You’ll be dealing with clients’ issues, from the first ticket to resolution. And, of course, you’ll be dealing with dummies who think toolkits are what Dad keeps in the garage, and who don’t know networks from nachos. That’s pretty much all you’ll do, day in, day out, so if you’d rather eat your own face than be polite to people every damn day, stop reading.<br /> <br />Still here? Cool. We also need you to document every step. So explain stuff to clients, and write it down. Officially, this is “retaining system knowledge”. Really it’s so when someone deletes the wrong thing and plunges of Europe into darkness, you can prove you didn’t tell ’em to do it.<br /> <br />To sum up so far:<br /><br />• Answer the damn phone or email, log the damn tickets and help the damn client.<br /><br />• Don’t swear or say stuff like “hybrid cloud” unless you want to freak them out.<br /><br />• Prioritise. If someone says, “I’ve deleted the wrong thing and plunged half of Europe into darkness,” put ’em ahead of someone whose Instagram is freezing.<br /><br />• Pass the buck. No, really. If you can’t resolve the issue, escalate it to Sales, Accounts, Management or upper line support. None of them will thank you for this, so buy them drinks when we go out, even though all of them will be paid more than you.<br /><br />• Maintain a knowledge base and suggest ideas for improvement. Keep these work-related for the probation period, then try asking for at-desk massages and in-house baristas. You won’t get them, but it’ll be slightly harder for us to fire you.<br /> <br />Don’t bother applying unless you have, or can convincingly lie about having:<br /><br />• one year’s experience on a technical and client-focused support desk.<br /><br />• one year’s customer service experience in any sector.<br /><br />• a logical approach to resolving functional and technical issues.<br /><br />• the ability to assess and document client issues, user experiences and processes.<br /><br />• a professional phone and email manner.<br /><br />• the ability to talk to people at different levels, with diverse backgrounds, without sighing or asking if they were dropped on their head as a baby.<br /><br />• experience of being accountable in a small team and the ability to work independently.<br /><br />• understanding of data protection and compliance principles, namely GDPR.<br /> <br />We need you to be organized, systematic, a good communicator, a problem-solver, proactive, reliable and able to prioritise. You need to know the Microsoft Office suite too – but, let’s face it, even your grandma can work Outlook, Word and Excel these days.<br /> <br />If you can do all that, you’re halfway through the door. If you can do all that, and you have experience of MS SharePoint (2010 and 2013), Zendesk, Targetprocess, remote assistance software and support portals, and conceptualising system frameworks and impacts, maybe those massages and baristas will happen.*<br /><br />*They won’t.<br /><br />Interested? please send us a CV and be sure to include a covering letter. That's right you don't go fishing without a hook. We look forward to hearing from you."

    "content": "One in five households in the UK live in social housing, a sector with the right values at its core but that has historically struggled to deploy innovations in the home. Many residents still can’t afford to heat their homes and live in cold, mouldy properties they can’t be proud of. At Switchee, we believe that everyone deserves to live in a decent home and that the environments we inhabit have a massive influence on our ability to enjoy life and prosper.<br /><br />We may be only three years old, but it’s already been quite a ride! Our first product, the internet connected Switchee thermostat is already in 35 of the biggest housing providers in the UK. We’re growing 100% year on year and are backed by some of the best-known investors in technology and social impact.<br /><br />To strengthen our small team of 15 passionate and ambitious people we are looking for an outstanding individual to join us as<br /><br />*Operations* *Associate*.<br /><br />We are driven by a collective desire to make a positive impact in the housing sector, both for residents and landlords, so your commitment to our values and mission are paramount.<br /><br />*Your* *responsibilities*<br /><br />As Operations Associate you will be responsible for solving a wide range of business-critical logistical, technical and relationship management challenges. We are a company built on a strong technical foundation, which you will need to learn and understand. You’ll need to grasp and effectively manage a range of data sets, technology platforms and human complexity. Most importantly you will need initiative and drive.<br /><br />The role combines stakeholder management and a continuous requirement to solve new and complex operational problems. You will play an integral part in the delivery of Switchee services to our large social housing customers and the communities they house; you will work across fulfilment from our manufacturing partners, installer support, IoT fleet management, product testing and customer project management and delivery.<br /><br />The work will entail close collaboration with other operations functions as well as our sales and customer success and development teams. As an early joiner to the Operations team, at a time of high growth, you will play an important role in supporting the Head of Operations in designing the build out of our whole Operations capability.<br /><br />Being more specific, you will:<br /><br />* Administer the suite of Switchee operations and device management platforms<br />* Support in overseeing, sequencing and auditing the of delivery of customer orders all over the UK, in co-ordination with our UK based manufacturing partner<br />* Report on, troubleshoot and diagnose any in-field device outages<br />* Work with our development team to design and implement tests for both our hardware and software<br />* Produce bespoke client reports and analytics<br />* Contribute to the wider development of the business by inputting into the development of our internal systems and process<br />* Be responsible for the overall quality control of your areas of service delivery<br />* Support sales and customer success by delivering exceptional results and reacting quickly in a complex operating environment<br />* Understand that blockers may be cultural/behavioural as well as technical and thrive in finding solutions to these<br />* Contribute to the growth of Switchee by building long-term commercial relationships with our commercial partners, especially contractors and installers<br />* Support on handling user issues in the field<br /><br /><br />*Your* *experience*<br /><br />We firmly believe extraordinary people can come from a wide range of places and we encourage graduate-level applicants.<br /><br />Required skills and experience:<br /><br />* Excellent communication and interpersonal skills<br />* Bachelor’s degree or equivalent experience<br />* Strong analytical & numeracy skills with complete command of Excel or equivalent statistical software package<br />* Proven ability to develop and implement effective solutions to complex commercial problems<br />* Be process and solutions orientated<br />* A very high attention to detail and a love of learning fast under pressure<br />* An ability to feel comfortable collaborating with people of all levels and backgrounds.<br />* Be able to grasp, handle and communicate technical concepts effectively.<br /><br /><br />Desirable skills and experience<br /><br />Between 1-2 years’ experience in operations or a similar commercial field<br />Fluency with large data sets and an ability to interrogate them for commercial insight<br />Experience in putting in place and handling processes required to manage and deliver large operational projects<br /><br /><br />*You*<br /><br />We are a diverse bunch of people at Switchee. That said, there are some characteristics we always look for:<br /><br />* You deeply care about Switchee’s mission; you have a desire to build something revolutionary, that will disrupt an industry, and positively impact ordinary people’s lives.<br />* You care about the environment, are interested in energy efficiency and have thought about the challenges and opportunities posed by an evolving domestic energy market.<br />* You like technology and neat solutions to complex problems.<br />* You thrive on challenge and change; you naturally gravitate to the hardest questions first and love thinking differently to solve them.<br />* You are biased towards action and you’re happiest when you’re ‘getting stuff done’.<br />* You’re open, positive & straightforward. You’re not afraid to stand up for your convictions, even when it’s hard to do so.<br />* You delight in your colleagues’ successes and thrive on your failures; you grasp any opportunity for learning and constantly seek to improve.<br /><br />*Our* *mission*<br /><br />We believe that radical innovation in internet connected technology can ensure that every resident, every day, is living in a home that allows them to succeed. That’s why our products are built not just on great technology, but on an understanding of what people want from the space they live in.<br /><br />This approach led us to reimagine the most mundane household object, a thermostat, into a product that automagically reduces energy bills, looks great and offers control to those who want it.<br /><br />We are also revolutionising the way social landlords manage their housing stock with an obsessively tailored SAAS property dashboard and handy alerts on things like when the boiler is going to break.<br /><br />Our next project is to build the ultimate connected hub for the social home. It’s going to revolutionise the way residents interact with their properties and landlords manage their homes.<br /><br />*Life* *at* *Switchee*<br /><br />We like to keep things simple and flexible at Switchee and consider you to be joining our family. We don’t currently track holidays so you’re free to take as much as you need. We occasionally work remotely but are sensitive to the needs of our colleagues.<br /><br />We socialise together with regular outings in London and an annual “working remotely” trip where you have the option (but not obligation) to join us in working from a fun location.<br /><br />If we end up working together, we can offer a competitive salary and a generous stake in the company.<br /><br />If you believe in the same things, don’t hesitate any longer, apply now! Please be in touch soon as we’ll proceed once the right person is found. If you’d like to apply please submit a CV and cover letter via our website."

Our mission is to use these solutions to power the emerging economic, social, and political operating systems of the planet.</p><p>Our teams are busy at work building the future of identity, financial markets, commerce, security and infrastructure, and more. If you are someone that thrives in a fast-paced environment where being self-directed, determined, and resilient are a requirement, we would love for you to join us. </p><p>The role:</p><p>Are you looking for the next frontier and challenge where you can apply your expertise in penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, and threat modeling?  Smart contracts are programs on a blockchain: they never go down, cannot be changed, and run as programmed.  These smart contracts directly control money, so you can see that their security is critical.</p><p>ConsenSys is a development pioneer of the Ethereum ecosystem and many of our tools such as Truffle, INFURA, MetaMask, BlockApps, are among the most widely adopted globally.  With ConsenSys Enterprise, we have been delivering blockchain software solutions to major global institutions for the past two years.</p><p>ConsenSys is expanding its efforts on smart contract security to meet the needs of enterprise clients as well as home-grown platforms ranging from prediction markets to decentralized crowdfunding, including uPort, Gnosis, Stabl, WeiFund, and Virtue Poker.  Our aim is to build the most technically-gifted and engineering-focused blockchain security team.</p><p>We are looking to hire someone with a passion for Solidity, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and security.  Candidates should relish in technical subtleties and minutiae, and have a passion for combining them with a flair for creativity and insight to hack smart contracts.</p><p>A significant part of the work can be done remotely wherever you are; little travel is anticipated (most of the technical team works remotely around the world). There's also opportunity to stay ahead of demand and lead and build out this team in case that's also of interest. This will be an engineering-first development organization, with the autonomy to manage itself in a manner conducive to software development excellence. It will be rigorous, demanding and not for everyone. We are looking for exceptionally intellectual, bright and technically driven individuals. We will be addressing challenges that have not been encountered before while borrowing from patterns in previous software architectures.</p><p>Qualifications</p><p>Minimum qualifications:</p><p>1 year demonstrated expertise with Solidity, the EVM, and blockchain</p><p>3 years of relevant work experience.</p><p>BS degree in a relevant field or equivalent practical experience.</p><p>Coding/scripting experience in one or more general purpose languages.</p><p>Preferred qualification:</p><p>Demonstrated expertise and contributions towards smart contract security, EIPs (Ethereum Improvement Proposals), or research.</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience analyzing the security of systems (penetration testing, Web Application security testing, vulnerability scanning, threat modeling, etc.).</p><p>5 years of relevant work experience, including experience in responding to security problems in target-rich environments, looking at security alerts, front-line analysis and response.</p><p>Programming experience in Python, C/C++, Java, or Go.</p><p>Advanced degree (MS, PhD) in relevant field is a plus.</p><p>Who We are, some of the perks of being part of a unique organization like ConsenSys:</p><p>The forefront of a revolution. At ConsenSys we fundamentally believe that a next generation of technologies presents the opportunity to create a more just and equitable society. We believe that there is an opportunity to bring the remaining 2 billion unbanked people into the global economy and to radically transform our society for the enrichment of humankind.</p><p>A dynamic startup environment with runway. ConsenSys is a thought leader in the blockchain space and we are absorbing a significant portion of the mindshare. This is both exciting and challenging, as we learn to scale our organization while adhering to the principles of decentralization. At ConsenSys, the runway allows you to focus on what you do best without worrying about the runway.</p><p>Continuous learning. You’ll be constantly exposed to new technologies, frameworks and ideas from your peers and as you work on different projects -- challenging you to stay at the top of your game.</p><p>Deep technical challenges. This entire ecosystem is less than 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler. There is much work to be done before these platforms can scale to the order of millions or billions of users. </p><p>ConsenSys was just named a Top 100 FinTech company by KPMG's 2016 Fintech Innovators report.</p></div></div><div><div>Compensation</div><div>$90K–$120K<br>0.01%–0.01%</div><div>Visa Sponsorship</div><div>Available</div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply Now</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to ConsenSys</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4>People also viewed</h4></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/nykaa-com/jobs/276079-security-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/nykaa-com/jobs/276079-security-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Security engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/nykaa-com/jobs/276079-security-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Nykaa.com</a></div><div>Gurgaon, Mumbai</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/enigma-platform/jobs/304453-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/enigma-platform/jobs/304453-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Blockchain Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/enigma-platform/jobs/304453-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Enigma</a></div><div>Petach Tikva</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bitclave/jobs/264169-blockchain-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bitclave/jobs/264169-blockchain-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Blockchain Developer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/bitclave/jobs/264169-blockchain-developer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>BitClave</a></div><div>San Jose, Beaverton, Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/takipi/jobs/313445-solution-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/takipi/jobs/313445-solution-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Solution Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/takipi/jobs/313445-solution-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>OverOps</a></div><div>San Francisco, Atlanta, Washington DC</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/cryptokitties/jobs/319673-blockchain-scaling-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/cryptokitties/jobs/319673-blockchain-scaling-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Blockchain Scaling Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/cryptokitties/jobs/319673-blockchain-scaling-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>CryptoKitties</a></div><div>Vancouver</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/originprotocol/jobs/308390-blockchain-solidity-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/originprotocol/jobs/308390-blockchain-solidity-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Blockchain/Solidity Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/originprotocol/jobs/308390-blockchain-solidity-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Origin Protocol</a></div><div>San Francisco, Boulder</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/0xproject/jobs/274577-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/0xproject/jobs/274577-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Blockchain Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/0xproject/jobs/274577-blockchain-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>0x</a></div><div>San Francisco</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/lightning/jobs/217817-lightning-protocol-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/lightning/jobs/217817-lightning-protocol-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Lightning Protocol Engineer</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/lightning/jobs/217817-lightning-protocol-engineer?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Lightning Labs</a></div><div>San Francisco, Silicon Valley, Remote</div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/tendermint/jobs/321761-senior-software-engineer-sdk?src=rec' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/tendermint/jobs/321761-senior-software-engineer-sdk?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Senior Software Engineer, SDK</a></div><div><a href='https://angel.co/tendermint/jobs/321761-senior-software-engineer-sdk?src=rec' rel='nofollow'>Tendermint</a></div><div>San Francisco, Berlin, Toronto</div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3>What We're Building</h3></div><div><div><p>ConsenSys is a blockchain venture production studio building decentralized applications, mostly on Ethereum.
