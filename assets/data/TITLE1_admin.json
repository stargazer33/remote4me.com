Each day we stream billions of realtime messages to millions of end-users for thousands of developers around the world. Some of the things our platform powers: HubSpot&rsquo;s chat and collaboration products, live score updates for millions of Australian Open tennis fans, live transit updates for three million Chicagoans. Working at Ably means helping to build the infrastructure that will power and shape the future of the internet.</p><br /><p>To see what life&rsquo;s like at Ably, check out our careers page at&nbsp;<a href='http://www.ably.io/careers'>www.ably.io/careers</a>.</p><br /><p><strong>What we do</strong></p><br /><p>Ably&rsquo;s engineering team is deeply technical, collectively bringing a wealth of experience and broad technology skills across infrastructure, security, distributed systems, and much more. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites and motivates us each day. If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably.</p><br /></div><br /><div class=&quot;description&quot;><br /><p><strong>In this role:</strong></p><br /><p>You will report to the Head of Infrastructure and will have responsibility for all aspects of Ably&rsquo;s infrastructure services. Together, these provide compute capacity, networking, and all ancillary services required to operate the core services and support the complete development cycle for all Ably products and services.</p><br /><p><strong>You will be successful if you:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Have a deep technical understanding of how systems work top-to-bottom and are committed to continuing to advance that understanding</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Enjoy getting your hands dirty, getting things done, and seeing your creations from inception through to production use by consumers&rsquo; apps</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Understand the Site Reliability Engineering discipline (<a href='https://go.ably.io/what-is-sre'>https://go.ably.io/what-is-sre</a>)&nbsp; and are excited by the idea of infrastructure-as-code and no manual maintenance of systems.</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Care about technical excellence in your work and fitness for purpose in your code</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Want to join a team that&rsquo;s on a mission to provide the best possible service for our customers</p><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Technical skills needed:</strong></p><br /><p>Ably is a cloud-native business with infrastructure that is almost wholly cloud-based, and we expect that to remain the case, at least in the near and medium term. Therefore, you must be intimately familiar with operations at scale on public cloud infrastructure, using the full range of functionality from the public cloud providers.</p><br /><p>This is primarily a software development role; not a traditional DevOps or sysadmin role. Ably&rsquo;s infrastructure operations are based currently on internally-developed software for deployment and orchestration, instance management and health monitoring, plus administration of the multiple ancillary systems used to operate the service. Therefore, you need to be a developer first, and have an established record of software development in production systems.</p><br /><p>As with all of our developer roles, we strongly prefer candidates that have a track record of working with open source, either with their own projects or contributions to community projects.</p><br /><p>Much of our existing infrastructure management code is written in Ruby and Go. We very much would like to see Ruby (not Rails) experience, even if not as a main language, and Go experience is advantageous.</p><br /><p>Our infrastructure runs in the public AWS cloud and therefore we need to see in-depth experience of operating production systems in the public cloud, and a detailed understanding of the full range of cloud services we use.</p><br /><p>We expect you to be very strong technically in Linux systems administration and networking.</p><br /><p><strong>Nice to have skills:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Containerisation, Docker;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Orchestration with Kubernetes or similar frameworks;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Go, Node.js and Bash;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Cassandra;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Experience with CI/CD systems;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Our team are active open source contributors and are encouraged to do this as part of their role at Ably.&nbsp; We like new team members who enjoy contributing back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small.&nbsp;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Good grasp of Agile, Kanban and SCRUM.</p><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What&rsquo;s it like to work at Ably?</strong></p><br /><p>Founded by two engineers who spotted a hard and largely unsolved problem, Ably is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide the infrastructure required for a high-bandwidth, always-connected world we hire engineers with a broad set of technical skills who are ready and capable of taking on challenging realtime engineering problems.</p><br /><p>As a company and engineering team we&rsquo;re committed to a future internet that&rsquo;s open and Ably&rsquo;s engineers contribute to existing open source projects. See&nbsp;<a href='https://go.ably.io/open'>https://go.ably.io/open</a>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We want to work in a company of inclusive people who treat each other well.

The last 4 years, ViaBill has grown from our first office in an art gallery to multiple offices throughout the world and from a handful of customers to handling transactions worth more than $150M per year.&nbsp; At ViaBill, we know that becoming the best at something is not easy. It takes skill, hard work, and an unmatched level of ambition. We believe in these ideals and offer a job with great potential for career development, freedom to unfold skills and competencies, and an environment that values different perspectives. Continuous improvement, learning, and growth are encouraged and even rewarded. From engineers to sales, we’re on the hunt for exceptional talent to help us scale our business and get ViaBill into the hands of millions of people.

However, as a UK-based company, some overlap with UK hours will be required. By default, you should assume that your working hours would be +/- 3h max from GMT start times of 9.00AM UK start time. There is some flexibility in this but please be aware that staff members starting outside of these hours are rare and, as such, if you would expect these hours to be an issue for you then we would not suggest that you apply.
