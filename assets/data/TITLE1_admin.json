Our vision is to empower developers around the world to ship great products.\\n\\nWe're a distributed, diverse, and growing team, spread across Europe. The company is based in Cologne, Germany, where we have a small office in a coworking space. However, less than 5% of us actually work there. All workflows are designed to function remotely - but of course, if you want to visit Cologne, you are more than welcome!\\n\\nWhat we offer on top:\\n\\n\\n* Choose the hardware you like the most!\\n\\n* Family first - we have more kids than employees!\\n\\n* Join our team at conferences all over the globe!\\n\\n* Internal Hackathons - we love to challenge ourselves!\\n\\n* 2 Off-Sites per year (check our photos on&nbsp;Instagram)!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat’s the most outstanding part about working for Giant Swarm?\\n&quot;It's a long list, but for me, the most important thing is the people. It's great to be surrounded by so many smart people - there's a lot of work to do but it doesn't feel like an uphill struggle because everyone pulls their weight so well&quot;\\n(Simon Weald, SRE)\\n\\nWhile we are remote-first, we appreciate quality time with our co-workers, so we meet in person twice a year to work and have fun together.\\n\\nWork-life integration\\n\\n\\n* Flexible working hours, and working from home or anywhere you prefer\\n\\n* Currently, the number of kids from our team members outnumbers the number of employees.\\n\\n* We don’t only care about the kids “within” the company, but also about all children - for example, we compensate the carbon of all our flights.\\n\\n* As an international company, we want to create similar standards for everyone, regardless of location. So, additional perks (for example, a location-aware, fixed amount paid each month to cover costs like co-working, phone contracts or gym memberships), paid parental leave and healthcare compensation are compulsory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour Job\\n\\n\\n* You maintain, operate and upgrade our own and our customer’s Kubernetes clusters.\\n\\n* You will design, configure, build, and maintain our core infrastructure, from kernel parameters to the cloud provider templates.\\n\\n* You understand how servers and systems work and you tweak their behavior to your needs.\\n\\n* You will be responsible for our monitoring, logging and alerting.\\n\\n* You will help resolve incidents on our own and our customer’s clusters.\\n\\n* You participate in the on-call support schedule (~ one 24 hours shift every 2 weeks)\\n\\n* You are a go-to person in case our developers need advice regarding infrastructure.\\n\\n* You will automate all the things.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRequirements\\n\\n\\n* You must have deep, hands-on knowledge of Kubernetes from both the end-user and the operation side.\\n\\n* You have wide experience with and are able to debug Networking, Security, Linux (Kernel, Namespaces, cgroups).\\n\\n* You have great debugging skills and you are not afraid to deep dive into thousands of lines of logs.\\n\\n* You have decent coding skills, preferably in Go. You have experience with maintaining infrastructure with code.\\n\\n* You know the good and bad parts of various automatization tools (Terraform, Chef, Puppet, Ansible or Saltstack).\\n\\n* You are fluent with CNCF products running on top of Kubernetes (prometheus, grafana, ingress controller, …) you know how to use them and how to configure them.\\n\\n* You have a decent knowledge of storage including software-defined storage.\\n\\n* You like reverse and performance engineering.\\n\\n* You automate all the things by writing code. Using bash scripts for it makes you sad :)\\n\\n* We are currently mostly distributed around Europe (around UTC), but we have recently won our first US client and are looking for someone in the same time zone. Thus, you are located somewhere at the American (North, South or Central) East Coast.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy we think this job is worth applying for!\\n\\nImpact, Impact, Impact! We are a remote-first organization with a growing team from 15+ European countries. Every new team member changes the team. This is great! People who know things we don’t are highly welcome.\\n\\n“It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission” (Grace Hopper) - sure, it’s not 100% like this, but we have a strong culture of failure which, is part of our agile mindset. We don’t do things like in the guidebook. You can try things out! Our default to 100% transparency will help you here.\\nWe play a key role in our customers' digital transformation. We have partnered up with Amazon and Microsoft to provide our solution on their cloud platforms - more will follow.\\nWe have been in this ecosystem from the get-go and as part of the CNCF family, we feel at home in the community. As a part of Giant Swarm, you will also join this extended family.\\nWe serve some of Europe's leading organizations and are talking to many more.\\n\\nWhat’s the most challenging part of your job?&quot;Finding time to concentrate on a specific task (especially if it's in-depth) - SREs context-switch a lot&quot;\\n(Simon Weald, SRE)\\n\\nInterested?

Each day we stream billions of realtime messages to millions of end-users for thousands of developers around the world. Some of the things our platform powers: HubSpot&rsquo;s chat and collaboration products, live score updates for millions of Australian Open tennis fans, live transit updates for three million Chicagoans. Working at Ably means helping to build the infrastructure that will power and shape the future of the internet.</p><br /><p>To see what life&rsquo;s like at Ably, check out our careers page at&nbsp;<a href='http://www.ably.io/careers'>www.ably.io/careers</a>.</p><br /><p><strong>What we do</strong></p><br /><p>Ably&rsquo;s engineering team is deeply technical, collectively bringing a wealth of experience and broad technology skills across infrastructure, security, distributed systems, and much more. The calibre of the code we produce is what excites and motivates us each day. If you enjoy solving hard distributed system problems that are mostly platform agnostic and theoretical in nature, then you'll love working at Ably.</p><br /></div><br /><div class=&quot;description&quot;><br /><p><strong>In this role:</strong></p><br /><p>You will report to the Head of Infrastructure and will have responsibility for all aspects of Ably&rsquo;s infrastructure services. Together, these provide compute capacity, networking, and all ancillary services required to operate the core services and support the complete development cycle for all Ably products and services.</p><br /><p><strong>You will be successful if you:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Have a deep technical understanding of how systems work top-to-bottom and are committed to continuing to advance that understanding</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Enjoy getting your hands dirty, getting things done, and seeing your creations from inception through to production use by consumers&rsquo; apps</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Understand the Site Reliability Engineering discipline (<a href='https://go.ably.io/what-is-sre'>https://go.ably.io/what-is-sre</a>)&nbsp; and are excited by the idea of infrastructure-as-code and no manual maintenance of systems.</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Care about technical excellence in your work and fitness for purpose in your code</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Want to join a team that&rsquo;s on a mission to provide the best possible service for our customers</p><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Technical skills needed:</strong></p><br /><p>Ably is a cloud-native business with infrastructure that is almost wholly cloud-based, and we expect that to remain the case, at least in the near and medium term. Therefore, you must be intimately familiar with operations at scale on public cloud infrastructure, using the full range of functionality from the public cloud providers.</p><br /><p>This is primarily a software development role; not a traditional DevOps or sysadmin role. Ably&rsquo;s infrastructure operations are based currently on internally-developed software for deployment and orchestration, instance management and health monitoring, plus administration of the multiple ancillary systems used to operate the service. Therefore, you need to be a developer first, and have an established record of software development in production systems.</p><br /><p>As with all of our developer roles, we strongly prefer candidates that have a track record of working with open source, either with their own projects or contributions to community projects.</p><br /><p>Much of our existing infrastructure management code is written in Ruby and Go. We very much would like to see Ruby (not Rails) experience, even if not as a main language, and Go experience is advantageous.</p><br /><p>Our infrastructure runs in the public AWS cloud and therefore we need to see in-depth experience of operating production systems in the public cloud, and a detailed understanding of the full range of cloud services we use.</p><br /><p>We expect you to be very strong technically in Linux systems administration and networking.</p><br /><p><strong>Nice to have skills:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li><br /><p>Containerisation, Docker;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Orchestration with Kubernetes or similar frameworks;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Go, Node.js and Bash;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Cassandra;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Experience with CI/CD systems;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Our team are active open source contributors and are encouraged to do this as part of their role at Ably.&nbsp; We like new team members who enjoy contributing back to the open source community, even if those contributions are small.&nbsp;</p><br /></li><br /><li><br /><p>Good grasp of Agile, Kanban and SCRUM.</p><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What&rsquo;s it like to work at Ably?</strong></p><br /><p>Founded by two engineers who spotted a hard and largely unsolved problem, Ably is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide the infrastructure required for a high-bandwidth, always-connected world we hire engineers with a broad set of technical skills who are ready and capable of taking on challenging realtime engineering problems.</p><br /><p>As a company and engineering team we&rsquo;re committed to a future internet that&rsquo;s open and Ably&rsquo;s engineers contribute to existing open source projects. See&nbsp;<a href='https://go.ably.io/open'>https://go.ably.io/open</a>&nbsp;</p><br /><p>We want to work in a company of inclusive people who treat each other well.

The last 4 years, ViaBill has grown from our first office in an art gallery to multiple offices throughout the world and from a handful of customers to handling transactions worth more than $150M per year.&nbsp; At ViaBill, we know that becoming the best at something is not easy. It takes skill, hard work, and an unmatched level of ambition. We believe in these ideals and offer a job with great potential for career development, freedom to unfold skills and competencies, and an environment that values different perspectives. Continuous improvement, learning, and growth are encouraged and even rewarded. From engineers to sales, we’re on the hunt for exceptional talent to help us scale our business and get ViaBill into the hands of millions of people.

There is some flexibility in this but please be aware that staff members starting outside of these hours are rare and, as such, if you would expect these hours to be an issue for you then we would not suggest that you apply.
