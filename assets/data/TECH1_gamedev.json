The experiences they publish work consistently across all browsers and devices, and all customer engagement is tracked with extensive analytics. All without writing code.</span></p><p><strong>About the Product</strong></p><p><span>Designing and building the Ceros platform is not an easy task. We require the best-of-the-best web developers, designers, and QA testers, ready to bring the functionality of desktop software to the web, often pushing web browsers to the limits of what’s currently possible.</span></p><p><span>Our codebase is 95% JavaScript and the Ceros product is comprised of multiple single-page applications with a client-heavy focus. We use libraries like jQuery, Require, and Backbone. The Ceros Studio is architected around the HTML5 Canvas element.</span></p><p><span>We’re not language zealots. We believe in using the right tool for the job, and our current server-side infrastructure runs PHP, Node.js, Redis, AWS Aurora, Chef, etc. on the Amazon AWS cloud.</span></p><p><strong>About the Team</strong></p><p><span>As part of the Ceros product team, you’ll be working with a small, cross-functional group of the most talented people you’ve ever worked with. We hire only passionate and creative people with a proven and unquestionable ability to execute, and every member of the team is equally responsible for moving the product forward.</span></p><p><span>We have a dynamic company culture that collaborates daily. We care deeply about the user experience, and we debate passionately about our ideas. When you work at Ceros, you check your ego at the door, and you aren’t afraid to be honest, especially to yourself. We take our jobs seriously but ourselves not so much -- whether it’s cracking jokes in the chat room or poking fun at the CEO’s atrocious spelling.</span></p><p><strong>About the Job</strong></p><p><span>Working completely from home, you’ll be communicating often through chat rooms, email, and video conferencing. We offer flexible working hours and an extremely flexible vacation policy. And we provide excellent gear (15” Macbook Pro, iPad, external monitor, etc.).</span></p><p><span>We believe that every piece of content created within Ceros is an experience. As such, we strive for the user’s experience to be as smooth as possible. To achieve this, we need developers with a passion for web performance. We’re looking for people with experience profiling javascript applications and squeezing every last millisecond out of the code. We want somebody that is knowledgeable in web performance best practices and strives to make code faster.</span></p><p><span>Desired experience:</span></p><ul><li><span>Object-oriented programming</span></li><li><span>Image &amp; video asset optimization (Webp, Adaptive bitrate streaming, etc.)</span></li><li><span>Asset preloading </span></li><li><span>Efficient use of caches</span></li><li><span>Building performant web animations</span></li><li><span>HTTP/2 protocol to streamline loading</span></li><li><span>Impress us with anything else you have experience with!</span></li></ul><p><span>As a developer, your typical day-to-day involves:</span></p><ul><li><span>writing maintainable code (probably goes without saying),</span></li><li><span>having your day ruined by functional QA testers who find every bug you write,</span></li><li><span>carrying out and being on the receiving end of intense code review sessions from your peers who hold your work (and their own) at the highest of standards,</span></li><li><span>agonizing over the user experience until even a trained monkey could use the product,</span></li><li><span>collaborating with and mentoring your peers on security best practices,</span></li><li><span>and finally, deploying your code to production and seeing the customer create something amazing and beautiful with it.</span></li></ul><p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p><p><span>If you’re interested in being part of the Ceros team, please send your resume and a cover letter to us. We’re a company of passionate, honest, and sometimes silly people, so don’t be afraid to express yourself.</span></p>                </div>                                    <div>                                    <div>                                        <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/186544?reset=False&amp;ra=10yMLam10e64&amp;oqs=a%3D10yMLam10e64' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>                                    </div>                        </div>        </div>            <h2>About Ceros</h2>            <div><p>With flexible hours, a generous vacation policy and the best darn coworkers you could ask for, we don't need to resort to bribing new hires with candy from our creepy white van.</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Vacation Policy</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Health Insurance</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Enjoy Your Work</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Top-notch Gear</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work 100% From Home</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Team meet-ups 3x/year</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
