Today more than 25,000 businesses, including New Relic, Sotheby’s, and Shopify, use Intercom to connect with a billion unique people worldwide.</p><p>Intercom is a deeply creative company with the confidence to believe it can fundamentally change the future of internet business. Our people are incredibly ambitious, yet humble. Warm, accepting, and positive. Whether you build, market, sell or support product, we want you to make your mark with us.</p><p><strong><strong>What's The Opportunity? </strong></strong></p><p>This is more than a technical role, you’ll be a creative product and technical contributor. You’ll use your experience to inform our engineering process and decisions when building new features and ensuring scalability and availability of the entire platform.</p><p>You’ll be part of one of our product teams which are multidisciplinary with design, frontend and backend engineering combined. While specialisation is important, we discourage pigeonholing. Our most effective people work across design and implementation, making the right technology decisions to build the best product.</p><p>One of our senior engineers, joining from a major PaaS provider, described his experience as “Before, I saw customers through a very large telescope. Now I’m right beside them.” We love the satisfaction of hearing how happy our customers are with what we build for them.</p><p><strong><strong>What Will I Be Doing? </strong></strong></p><p>As a Software Product Engineer you will:</p><ul><li>Contribute to our technical architecture as we grow. We scale to service requests from all our customers’ customers. We’re growing and so are they.</li><li>Care about agility as much you care for scalability and availability. Continuous deployment keeps us focused on incremental releases. Even our biggest technical achievements roll out piece by piece, feature flagged out of sight. Projects are kept short and tightly scoped. Teams&nbsp;<a href='http://blog.intercom.io/shipping-is-your-companys-heartbeat/' rel='nofollow'>build a weekly cadence</a>of releases</li><li>Ship a change to production on your first day and a significant public release in your first week. That “day one” change is automatically deployed to production&nbsp;<a href='http://blog.intercom.io/moving-faster-with-smaller-steps/' rel='nofollow'>along with 80 other deployments</a>&nbsp;(on average) each weekday</li><li>Be proud of what you work on, obsess about the quality of the work you produce. Join us to do the best work of your career.</li><li>Have regular opportunity and support for career growth. We are constantly growing and forming new teams. For those who are motivated to lead, we hugely bias internal promotions to Engineering Lead and Engineering Director roles. Public speaking, blogging, open source contributions and community participation is something we strongly encourage (and reward). We run events to share how we think and how we go about building great product - our&nbsp;<a href='https://twitter.com/hashtag/IntercomInsights' rel='nofollow'>last one</a>&nbsp;was very well received.</li></ul><p><strong><strong>What qualifications do I need?</strong></strong></p><p>Typically, a degree level qualification but at least NQF Level 6 (or similar)</p><p><strong><strong>What skills do I need?&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></strong></p><ul><li>Ideally, you’ve built an exciting SaaS product in your previous roles and loved the satisfaction that comes with knowing that people around the world are using something you’ve created</li><li>You can demonstrate significant impact that your work has head on the product and/or the team</li><li>You also need to have deep knowledge of a high-level programming language (for example, Ruby, Python, Perl etc.) but it doesn’t need to be a language that we use here! Great people are effective and learn what we use quickly (or introduce us to better ways of working)</li><li>You will have experience with Distributed systems</li><li>Knowledge of Web or mobile animation</li></ul><p><strong><strong>Where will I be working?</strong></strong></p><p>Your main place of work will be at our London office but you may be required occasionally to travel to our offices in Dublin and San Francisco.</p><p></p><p>First, apply so we can review your CV :) As the next step, we will send you our take home test to work on in your own time. You can find more details on the questions and how we evaluate answers&nbsp;. The following step will be a phone interview with one of our engineers which will focus on technical and&nbsp;&nbsp;questions (this step is sometimes broken down into 2 interviews). The final step is an onsite interview in our Dublin office (we can help with travel arrangements, visas etc.).</p><p><strong><strong>What could I be paid?</strong></strong></p><p>The salary range for this role is £60,000-£100,000, depending upon the amount of experience you bring to the role.</p><p><strong><strong>Benefits&nbsp;</strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p>We are a well treated bunch, with awesome benefits! If there’s something important to you that’s not on this list, talk to us! :)</p><ul><li>Competitive salary and meaningful equity in a fast-growing start-up</li><li>We serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner every weekday. There are also snacks and drinks on tap to keep you topped up</li><li>Regular compensation reviews - we reward great work!</li><li>Peace of mind with life assurance, as well as comprehensive health and dental insurance for you and your dependents</li><li>Open vacation policy and flexible holidays so you can take time off when you need to</li><li>Paid parental leave to let you spend valuable time with your loved ones</li><li>Commuting is a breeze with our generous public transport allowance</li><li>Keep active with our wellness programme that allows you to expense gym and other sports activities up to £90 quarterly</li><li>MacBooks are our standard, but we’re happy to get you whatever equipment helps you get your job done</li></ul><p>We are a diverse bunch of people and we want to continue to attract and retain a diverse range of people into our organisation. We're committed to an inclusive and diverse Intercom! We do not discriminate based on gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, civil or family status, age, disability, or race.</p><span>Apply now</span></div>"
