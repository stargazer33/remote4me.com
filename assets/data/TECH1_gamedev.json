    "content": "<p>We're looking for a frontend software engineer to join our growing team. We're looking for someone with strong opinions and an interest in running. We're open to a diversity of experience: you may be fresh out of university or a senior lead, we'd be interested to hear from you and see how we could work together.</p><br /><p><strong>What&rsquo;s Byrde?</strong></p><br /><p>We're building a product that&rsquo;s re-imagining how runners run. We're made by runners for runners and will improve the running experience for the 200 million runners globally. From experience design to AI we're making running more accessible and helping runners build a healthy lasting habit. The core of the product is an adaptive training plan that moves and updates as a runner progresses. The plan improves a runner&rsquo;s health and well-being one run at a time.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re in the process of finishing the beta version of the product that we&rsquo;ll be testing with runners through the UK ahead of the first public release in October 2020.</p><br /><p><strong>What you&rsquo;ll be working on</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be defining and developing the front-end of the product across Android and iOS using Dart, the Flutter framework, node.js. You&rsquo;ll be working collaboratively with other members of the team to define our front-end, motion graphics, animations and data visualisations. It&rsquo;s early days for the product so you&rsquo;re likely to cover the full-stack on some features as we move to our launch.</p><br /><p><strong>Who you are</strong></p><br /><p>The&nbsp; most important qualities we&rsquo;re looking for is someone who&rsquo;s self-motivated and interested in continually learning new technologies and languages. If that sounds like you then get in touch even if you don&rsquo;t have the exact experience we&rsquo;re looking for below.</p><br /><p>Ideally you&rsquo;ll have the following, or adjacent, experience:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience of Dart, Java or Swift (but really if you&rsquo;ve worked in Python, C or Javascript it&rsquo;s easy to transition to Dart)</li><br /><li>Experience of creating declarative UIs and working with stateful and stateless elements (e.g Flutter, React etc)</li><br /><li>Experience working with state management frameworks (e.g Redux, rxjs etc)</li><br /><li>Experience of programmatically generating animations and general understanding of motion graphic concepts</li><br /><li>Experience of generating graphs and data visualisations programmatically</li><br /><li>Experience of manipulating maps and generating dynamic information about a user&rsquo;s journey e.g. an elevation plot or speed at certain points of the journey. For reference, at the moment, we&rsquo;re expecting to use Mapbox and geoJSON but you might have used different systems</li><br /><li>Experience of using APIs to populate your front-end</li><br /><li>Experience of having worked using MVC, MTV, BLoC et al. and an understanding of why separation of concerns helps make software more robust</li><br /><li>Experience, even if limited to personal projects, of server provisioning and/or working with serverless platforms like Google&rsquo;s Firebase or AWS&rsquo;s Lamda</li><br /><li>Ability to roll with changes. We&rsquo;re actively user testing with runners and incorporating their feedback into the product as quickly as possible</li><br /><li>Ability to make pragmatic, quick decisions and a recognition that 'done&rsquo; is often better than &lsquo;perfect&rsquo;</li><br /><li>Interest in design, design thinking and how it interacts with development</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Who we are</strong></p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re currently a small team of three. Between us we&rsquo;ve experience of designing, developing and delivering work for Google, Dyson and Groupon amongst others. We&rsquo;re passionate about running and making the sport more accessible. We&rsquo;re also passionate about building an amazing work culture with a focus on allowing the time and space for everyone to do their best work.</p><br /><p><strong>Work for humans</strong></p><br /><p>Just as Byrde adapts to a runner we believe work needs to do the same. We have core hours when all meetings and standups happen. From there it's up to you when you feel you work best, or when it works best for you around the rest of your life. We use fairly standard tools: G Suite, Github and Slack are our core</p><br /><p><strong>Bristol or remote</strong></p><br /><p>From the start we&rsquo;ve been a remote-first company. If you&rsquo;re Bristol based, or interested in coming to Bristol: awesome! It&rsquo;s a running paradise here. From the flat, fast paths of the floating harbour through to the inner city trails taking you to the Somerset countryside. But if you&rsquo;ve got better trail-heads where you&rsquo;re already based that&rsquo;s awesome too. We were set up as a remote-first company and we&rsquo;re happy to receive applications from anyone within &plusmn; 2 hours time difference of UTC.</p><br /><p><strong>What you'll get</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Equity in the company</li><br /><li>Grown-up holiday policy</li><br /><li>Personal development budget</li><br /><li>Salary and pension as soon as we get funding</li><br /></ul><br /><p>We believe strongly that someone joining at this early stage should be rewarded generously with their equity share of the company.</p><br /><p><strong>Equal opportunities</strong></p><br /><p>We believe a diverse workplace is a strong workplace. Byrde is committed to equal opportunity for our roles and would strongly encourage anyone to apply for this role if it is of interest (even if you feel you might not necessarily have exactly the matching skills). All applicants will be treated in the same way regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, colour, age, disability or any other issue of diversity.</p>",

You'll work&nbsp;directly with top-tier artists, game designers, and educators from Harvard, Leapfrog, Teach For America,&nbsp;and more to build games that teach computer science to kids while *actually* being fun! The best part: this is a hands-on role. Less meetings, more coding! Sound exciting? Read on...\\n\\nAbout the Role\\n\\nYou’ll spearhead&nbsp;development of our first Unity-based version of Kodable,&nbsp;with&nbsp;the opportunity to work&nbsp;in a variety of areas including game frameworks, game design, UI, networking, optimization and everything in between. This is a direct-producer&nbsp;role, we're looking for someone that wants to build the product, not just direct.\\n\\nCurrently, Kodable is multi-platform with a main codebase written in JavaScript using Cocos2d-X. We have production deployments for Web and iOS that routinely get hundreds of thousands of&nbsp;users a week.

You’ll work with a product team with over 50 years of collective experience creating top-notch games for companies like EA, Leapfrog, and Scientific Learning. Every member of the team has a voice in making Kodable great.\\n\\nYou'll join a&nbsp;remote-first team that prioritizes communication, collaboration, and insights from diverse backgrounds when building new features. Most of the team is&nbsp;based in the Bay Area, but includes team members from across&nbsp;the United States as well as immigrants from Kenya and Kyrgyzstan.&nbsp;Kodable places value on creating an inclusive culture, where we can learn from each other’s different experiences.\\n\\nWe also focus on making each other better as people, not just as workers. For example, we have a #pushups channel in Slack (complete with pushup-coach bot)&nbsp;and we all&nbsp;set a weekly goal for ourselves that has nothing to do with work.

We will pay you $500 per game.&nbsp;These are simple games, so they shouldn't take you too long to create. Interested? Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 72 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>            </div>        <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>            Apply        </a>                            </div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p><p>While we’ve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p><p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p><ul><li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li><li>Working on interesting technical problems that haven’t been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li><li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li><li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li><li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li></ul><p>…you should reach out.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Any computer / tech you want</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
