We will pay you $500 per game.&nbsp;These are simple games, so they shouldn't take you too long to create. Interested? Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 24 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p><p>While we’ve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p><p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p><ul><li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li><li>Working on interesting technical problems that haven’t been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li><li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li><li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li><li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li></ul><p>…you should reach out.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Any computer / tech you want</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We will pay you $500 per game.&nbsp;These are simple games, so they shouldn't take you too long to create. Interested? Read on!</em></strong></p><p><a href='https://withkoji.com' rel='nofollow'>Koji</a> is a platform that lets non-coders &quot;remix&quot; games and apps to customize game assets, styles, and basic mechanics. We are excited to work with developers to grow our catalogue of games and let ordinary people remix them into new games that are hilarious, shocking, silly, fun, or all of the above!</p><p><strong>If you have ever wanted to get paid to make fun games and reach potentially millions of people with your work, this is your opportunity.</strong> Koji games have been remixed and shared by all kinds of people, including celebrities, influencers, and athletes from around the world! Koji games embed natively in Reddit, Snapchat, and Instagram, and can be played from any device and on any browser.</p><p>We are looking for developers of all skill levels to create fun, engaging games that are easy to remix and customize. <strong>These games should NOT be complex.</strong> Game formats that work well on Koji include things like endless runners, puzzles like Candy Crush, new takes on classic arcade games, etc. Think of these things like the next evolution of Flash games, not the next Skyrim :)</p><p>There are already hundreds of game templates on Koji, some of our favorites include:</p><ul><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/element-match</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/space-blast</a></li><li><a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/burger-revenge</a></li></ul><p>You can see more of our favorites at <a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>https://withkoji.com/create</a></p><p>These games are created using Javascript, and are adapted to Koji through the inclusion of a few extra JSON files. Please click &quot;Remix&quot; on any of the games above in order to see the file structure, and how the app uses JSON config files in order to render Koji VCCs (Visual Customization Controls). These VCCs let non-coders customize and modify the games (to do things like turn <a href='https://withkoji.com/~Svarog1389/7c7bd6a6-7947-42dd-843b-4dd933fdb5a3' rel='nofollow'>this game</a> into <a href='https://withkoji.com/~luis/deeterplays-spaceship-commando' rel='nofollow'>this game</a>).</p><p><strong>If you create a new game template that meets our specifications, we will pay you $500 USD per game.</strong> There is no limit on the number of games you can create for us, but additional games must be meaningfully distinct from each other in order to qualify for additional payment.</p><p>In order to be accepted, games must meet ALL of the following criteria:</p><ul><li>Game must load properly in the Koji editor and publish correctly from the editor. We recommend remixing a <a href='https://withkoji.com/tag/scaffolds-(for-developers)' rel='nofollow'>scaffold</a>, or remixing an existing game and simply deleting the game logic in the Koji editor and replacing it with your own game.<br><br></li><li>Game must include VCCs that allow people to remix and customize the game in meaningful ways (changing images, sounds, strings, and other game mechanics). Please remix some of the games on the &quot;<a href='https://withkoji.com/create' rel='nofollow'>/create</a>&quot; page tor examples of what kinds of things should be abstracted into VCCs. Changes to VCCs should be reflected immediately in the live preview of the Koji Editor via hot reloading.<br><br></li><li>If appropriate, game should include a backend with a leaderboard. Take a look at the code of some of the sample games for examples of how to do this using an Express server.<br><br></li><li>Game must be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices. Please make sure to test across browsers and devices. Game must work in Mobile Safari on iOS. If you do not have access to an iOS device, please join our Discord -- others in the community can help you to test and debug on iOS devices.<br><br></li><li>If game uses arrow keys, it should terminate propagation of those keypresses. Koji games render in iFrames, so pressing the down/up arrow keys when playing the game should not scroll the parent screen.<br><br></li><li>If a game has background audio/music, the music should not start playing until the user starts playing the game. No autoplay music on splash screens.<br><br></li><li>Game should feel compelling and fun to play. Use high-quality assets and pay attention to visual design. Use sounds when appropriate.</li></ul><p>Join our <a href='https://discord.gg/eQuMJF6' rel='nofollow'>Discord server</a> to connect with other developers if you have questions about how to use the platform, or are looking for feedback/inspiration for your game.</p><p><strong>Before you start working on your game, please apply using the application link and tell us a little bit about yourself, as well as give us a general idea of what you want to create.</strong> Don't worry, there's no lengthy interview process -- we just want to get a sense of what you want to build so we can make sure it meets our criteria before you start spending time working on it.</p><p>Once you've been approved (we try to process approvals within 24 hours), you will be given a link to a form where you can submit your game once it's finished, as well as your payment information. Once you've submitted your game, it will either be approved and you will be paid, or will be rejected with a list of required changes. After you make those changes, you can resubmit. Please make sure you share your game in Discord to get feedback from the community before submitting it to us for review.</p><p><strong>Let this be a change of pace from boring CRUD apps -- be creative, have fun, and get paid to make games! :)</strong></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://forms.gle/eNihPaasY8eb4EzB8' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Koji - Web App Development Platform</h4>            <div><p>Our small team is changing the way non-technical people think about creating software. In the same way that YouTube empowered everyone to become a video broadcaster, we are building a platform that empowers everyone to create apps.&nbsp;</p><p>There are millions of people in the world with ideas for apps and no means to bring those ideas to market. Some of those ideas might be viral hits or have utility to millions of users, but some of them might solve a problem that affects only a few thousand people, or a few hundred. Others might be silly games that make a handful of people giggle. They might be in languages we don’t understand; they might be made for cultures, or subcultures, of which we are not a part.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is so time-consuming, complex, and expensive to develop an app, that almost none of these ideas ever get a fair shake. Only an absurdly small percentage of ideas get built. Even those of us who are capable of full-stack development still limit our appetites because of the complexity of building, deploying, and maintaining an application.</p><p><strong>What is Koji?</strong></p><p><a href='https://venturebeat.com/2019/04/23/gometa-raises-6-million-and-launches-koji-web-app-development-platform/' rel='nofollow'>Koji, backed by over two dozen prominent investors</a>, is an app development platform that dramatically changes the dynamics of building and deploying web applications, empowering orders of magnitude more people to build apps.</p><p>Koji is a two sided marketplace where independent developers create app templates that can be purchased and cloned by “makers.” Koji is a development environment where makers can customize templates, expand their capabilities, and deploy them instantly. Because Koji is a collaborative platform, a supportive community of makers and developers is growing, discovering best practices, and forming lucrative relationships.</p><p>We are constantly getting feedback from users (from all walks of life and all around the world; sometimes tearful with joy and gratitude) who tell us how we have changed their lives. They have become entrepreneurs, found new ways to express their creativity, and get their product ideas to market.</p><p>While we’ve done much over the last 3 years, we are just getting started.</p><p><strong>If you are passionate about:</strong></p><ul><li>Playing a key role in architecting a broad platform and making an impact on the world stage,</li><li>Working on interesting technical problems that haven’t been solved before, utilizing cutting-edge technologies and methodologies,</li><li>Disrupting the status quo, and dramatically changing the dynamics of software development,</li><li>Empowering millions of people to create applications, launch new entrepreneurial ventures, and change their lives fundamentally,</li><li>Working with a close-knit team of technological dreamers who come from Google, MySpace, Buzzfeed, and have absurd, possibly attainable aspirations.</li></ul><p>…you should reach out.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Competitive Salary</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Stock Options</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Medical</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Dental</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>401k</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Any computer / tech you want</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Vacation / Sick Days</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We are currently focused on empowering young people to improve their mental health with engaging and effective digital solutions. In 2017, we launched&nbsp; <a href='https://www.championsoftheshengha.com/'>Champions of the Shengha</a> (COTS), a real-time card battling game that helps young people regulate their emotions through biofeedback, clinically proven through an RCT.</p><br /><p>We use an evidence-led, user-centred approach. That&rsquo;s a fancy way of saying we spend time getting to know a social issue really well and building empathy and understanding for the people we hope to reach. We&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work with the Wellcome Trust, ViiV Healthcare (GSK) and the NHS.</p><br /><h4><strong>About our current project</strong></h4><br /><p>Now, we are creating a game to support young people with low to medium anxiety.</p><br /><p>From our research, we know that there are an estimated 400,000 young people aged 7-12 in the UK with disordered anxiety, but 50-70% of these do not access support. Exposure therapy, the 'active ingredient' of CBT, is the most effective treatment for childhood anxiety disorders, but it is difficult for young people to access and costly for the NHS to provide. And when receiving treatment, an estimated 23-47% of young people drop off during the treatment period.</p><br /><p>At the same time, young people actively engage with games: 92% of boys and 96% of girls play games regularly, and 8-11 year olds in the UK spend on average 10 hours a week playing games.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our aim is to provide clinically effective, low-cost, accessible early support to young people aged 8-12 with low to medium anxiety by facilitating exposure therapy through our high quality, engaging and&nbsp; immersive digital game.</p><br /><h4><strong>The Role</strong></h4><br /><p>We're looking for a full stack developer who can support the data and data server, analytics, data dashboard site and distribution of our new mobile video game.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>The full stack developer will have the support of our game development team for adding data hooks into game code and our UX specialist, who can design the feel and flow of the frontend systems.&nbsp;</p><br /><h4><strong>Person Specification</strong></h4><br /><p><strong>Essential Skills &amp; Experience</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Knowledge of standard frontend languages, such as HTML 5, CSS3 or Javascript. (developer's preferred standard languages can be used for systems)</li><br /><li>Knowledge of standard backend languages, such as PHP, Java, Ruby or Python. (developer's preferred standard languages can be used for systems)</li><br /><li>Experience with using version control such as Perforce or Github.</li><br /><li>Proficiency in creating databases and dashboards in standard languages (ie, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLServer).</li><br /><li>Ability to work remotely and autonomously, communicating your availability to project lead and game producer.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Desirable Skills &amp; Experience</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience with creating Linux servers.</li><br /><li>Experience with unit and stress testing servers.</li><br /><li>Using JIRA to track progress.</li><br /><li>Able to travel to Manchester on occasion, if required, for direct development with game development team.</li><br /><li>Experience in using Unreal Engine 4.20+.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Please apply with a CV and covering letter.</strong></p>",

Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers.</p><p>You would be working on the core engine and the surrounding components that make up our application.</p><p>What we are looking for:</p><p>- Strong CS fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, networking)</p><p>- Prior experience building software systems (network game, game engine, Web browser, database engine, etc.)</p><p>Experience in any of the following is a plus:</p><p>- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)</p><p>- Database design and implementation (query planning, database/storage engines)</p><p>- Logic programming / optimization</p><p>Language experience:</p><p>- C++ is required</p><p>- Typescript / Javascript / Lua are plus.</p><p>- Any logic/constraint language, such as Prolog, Datalog, SAT / SMT, is a plus</p><p>The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there.

This is a 100% remote role, with a flat culture that gives you the autonomy to define how you can do the best work of your career.\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5>In this role, you will:</h5>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li>Collaborate with the marketing and design teams to reimagine and rebuild knack.com from scratch.</li>\n  <li>Use your creativity and experience to help tell Knack’s story and communicate Knack’s value.</li>\n  <li>Own the Knack marketing and customer-facing websites. You’ll lead on the architecture, content management system, and execution.</li>\n  <li>Use code to transform designs into polished and responsive digital marketing assets, including web templates, landing pages, micro-sites, newsletters, and case studies.</li>\n  <li>Help develop a consensus-driven process: collaborating on ideas (sketches, wireframes, mockups), producing web assets for early feedback, and continuously iterating on that feedback.</li>\n  <li>Use code and creativity to help convey complex messages in a simple and elegant manner to a broad audience.

Who says coders don’t care about design? We want to make beautiful things that we’re proud of, and this role will be a big part of that.</li>\n  <li>Humble but opinionated. You have lots of ideas, yet you are happy to shift directions when a better path emerges. You take your work much more seriously than you take yourself.</li>\n  <li>Okay being wrong sometimes. You are comfortable running experiments and don’t mind when the data disagrees with your ideas.</li>\n  <li>An active collaborator. You want feedback on your work early and often, and you get a kick out of a collaborative process because it challenges you to create better work.</li>\n  <li>Original and authentic.
