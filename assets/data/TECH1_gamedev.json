We are currently focused on empowering young people to improve their mental health with engaging and effective digital solutions. In 2017, we launched&nbsp; <a href='https://www.championsoftheshengha.com/'>Champions of the Shengha</a> (COTS), a real-time card battling game that helps young people regulate their emotions through biofeedback, clinically proven through an RCT.</p><br /><p>We use an evidence-led, user-centred approach. That&rsquo;s a fancy way of saying we spend time getting to know a social issue really well and building empathy and understanding for the people we hope to reach. We&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to work with the Wellcome Trust, ViiV Healthcare (GSK) and the NHS.</p><br /><h4><strong>About our current project</strong></h4><br /><p>Now, we are creating a game to support young people with low to medium anxiety.</p><br /><p>From our research, we know that there are an estimated 400,000 young people aged 7-12 in the UK with disordered anxiety, but 50-70% of these do not access support. Exposure therapy, the 'active ingredient' of CBT, is the most effective treatment for childhood anxiety disorders, but it is difficult for young people to access and costly for the NHS to provide. And when receiving treatment, an estimated 23-47% of young people drop off during the treatment period.</p><br /><p>At the same time, young people actively engage with games: 92% of boys and 96% of girls play games regularly, and 8-11 year olds in the UK spend on average 10 hours a week playing games.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>Our aim is to provide clinically effective, low-cost, accessible early support to young people aged 8-12 with low to medium anxiety by facilitating exposure therapy through our high quality, engaging and&nbsp; immersive digital game.</p><br /><h4><strong>The Role</strong></h4><br /><p>We're looking for a full stack developer who can support the data and data server, analytics, data dashboard site and distribution of our new mobile video game.&nbsp;</p><br /><p>The full stack developer will have the support of our game development team for adding data hooks into game code and our UX specialist, who can design the feel and flow of the frontend systems.&nbsp;</p><br /><h4><strong>Person Specification</strong></h4><br /><p><strong>Essential Skills &amp; Experience</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Knowledge of standard frontend languages, such as HTML 5, CSS3 or Javascript. (developer's preferred standard languages can be used for systems)</li><br /><li>Knowledge of standard backend languages, such as PHP, Java, Ruby or Python. (developer's preferred standard languages can be used for systems)</li><br /><li>Experience with using version control such as Perforce or Github.</li><br /><li>Proficiency in creating databases and dashboards in standard languages (ie, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLServer).</li><br /><li>Ability to work remotely and autonomously, communicating your availability to project lead and game producer.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Desirable Skills &amp; Experience</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience with creating Linux servers.</li><br /><li>Experience with unit and stress testing servers.</li><br /><li>Using JIRA to track progress.</li><br /><li>Able to travel to Manchester on occasion, if required, for direct development with game development team.</li><br /><li>Experience in using Unreal Engine 4.20+.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Please apply with a CV and covering letter.</strong></p>",

    "content": "Fact Labs | Founding Engineer | San Francisco and New York (NYC) | Onsite or Remote (US only) | Full Time<p>Building models in spreadsheets is broken. Spreadsheet models break down when you alter them, modularize them, or add more collaborators. Analysts in banking, investment management, and operations have gotten by with spreadsheets but not without enormous time and effort spent hacking around their many limitations. Fact Labs has developed a more powerful, more collaborative modeling paradigm that is inspired by logic programming and applied ontology yet is still accessible to sophisticated but non-programmer analysts. We are a small, funded, early-stage team with significant domain experience with our target customers.</p><p>You would be working on the core engine and the surrounding components that make up our application.</p><p>What we are looking for:</p><p>- Strong CS fundamentals (algorithms, data structures, networking)</p><p>- Prior experience building software systems (network game, game engine, Web browser, database engine, etc.)</p><p>Experience in any of the following is a plus:</p><p>- Language design and implementation (parsers, interpreters, virtual machines, compilers)</p><p>- Database design and implementation (query planning, database/storage engines)</p><p>- Logic programming / optimization</p><p>Language experience:</p><p>- C++ is required</p><p>- Typescript / Javascript / Lua are plus.</p><p>- Any logic/constraint language, such as Prolog, Datalog, SAT / SMT, is a plus</p><p>The modeling experience we’re building is unlike anything out there.

Who says coders don’t care about design? We want to make beautiful things that we’re proud of, and this role will be a big part of that.</li>\n  <li>Humble but opinionated. You have lots of ideas, yet you are happy to shift directions when a better path emerges. You take your work much more seriously than you take yourself.</li>\n  <li>Okay being wrong sometimes. You are comfortable running experiments and don’t mind when the data disagrees with your ideas.</li>\n  <li>An active collaborator.
