Our next-generation, all-in-one social media SaaS platform utilizes a proprietary scoring algorithm to discover, evaluate, and rank social content, changing how enterprises, franchises, and affiliates market on social media to their target audiences. SOCi has a growing team of passionate, innovative, and fun people in both our San Diego, CA and Austin, TX offices. \n  <br>*This position is open to fully remote candidates \n  <br>The job \n  <br>* We work collaboratively in groups of 3-4 (mobs) where you group program with other great engineers and product people, each representing different viewpoints and bringing different skills to the table. \n  <br>* Iterating and shipping daily in small increments, you're able to progress fast and have a sense of achievement every day going home. \n  <br>* Sometimes you'll need to complete other tasks and duties as needed. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>You \n  <br>* Love writing elegant code. \n  <br>* Have a solid foundation of core programming skills in MySQL, PHP and JavaScript \n  <br>* Have a strong sense of visual aesthetics on web and ability to make it reality with cutting-edge CSS. \n  <br>* Shiver in horror at the thought of copy-pasting coding. \n  <br>* Have&nbsp;experience working in social media space (a plus). \n  <br>* Get nightmares from badly formatted code. \n  <br>* Understand that usability and attention to visual details matters just as much as good performance and clean architecture. \n  <br>* You are equally comfortable discussing database architecture as you are in debating animations and shadows in the UI all the while keeping the user story in mind to ensure you're solving the right problem. \n  <br>* Have experience working with enterprise-grade SaaS products (a plus). \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What's SOCi's culture like? \n  <br>Our primary driver is professional growth and learning, coupled with a desire to help our customer succeed. We focus heavily on individual mentorship and guidance, peer feedback and are always pushing ourselves and each other to the next level.
