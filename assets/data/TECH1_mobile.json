platform to advocate and launch brands in real-time by allowing anyone to build a storefront in seconds. The platform provides tools to create and distribute original content paired to capsule collections with an emphasis on driving traffic to shops that generate sales. The apps and site allow users to intuitively curate collections from multiple affiliate networks to build pop-up stores connected to “window-fronts”. Users generate revenue on organic and sponsored posts (see gif below) while brands can seed products to content creators supported by campaign performance analytics via an admin panel.  </p><p>The service amplifies reach by providing embeddable window-fronts (aka flatlay cards) as customized dynamic units for premium publishers to serve content as native placements. It’s commissioned content crowdsourced as sponsored editorial — the power of actionable creative at scale. </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Los Angeles</span>, <span>Berlin</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Digital Media</span>, <span>Mobile Advertising</span>, <span>Image Recognition</span>, <span>Cryptocurrency</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/flatlayapp' rel='nofollow'>@flatlayapp</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://github.com/FLATLAY' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/FLATLAY</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://www.flat-lay.com' rel='nofollow'>flat-lay.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/750/662/750662-550f531bfe84fcacb5e40b6ec2e6ed40a142ee44.png?1475532585' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/493/752493-acf9b3f4c25088b99966d2391f4d8b6bca78fc7c.jpg?1475917752' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/494/752494-f333e8bd7cccbeda5d26e7039a28caf00042de0a.png?1475918143' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/618/752618-d0ab9c5aba91e1f4fb3eefc0f9c6f6dad94d48da.png?1475966575' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/790/387/790387-0f86ee1d3bea48c10f739d1dd9359ddfc0948afa.png?1487320328' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/790/388/790388-10e4042f20b7d144da58fb1fe4d3f191033fbcb4.png?1487320343' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/837/413/837413-3636a99f0809afde0ab2bfd181577f39ffc25b72.png?1507154302' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/837/414/837414-860b6064cf13754231ef38d34a4b2343614b9460.png?1507154392' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/271/866271-f06ff8dd6acc547f18e631073fb6840927d6bb9f.jpeg?1521837553' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/272/866272-5fbbea7e6de533e26f65186342a3d810451ad7d1.jpeg?1521837580' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div></div><div><span>See More</span></div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/273/866273-af3ccfbd7b524b520f8b577d329c4292ec2748f5.jpeg?1521837624' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/274/866274-e960a7ac458f977611c4459baf2b4c341387595e.png?1521837640' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/275/866275-008eafc2c3f4ddd80c40301e27275c0d7bb40ec6.png?1521837726' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/276/866276-d224cedf6c0daadb0d20c487b3e65906eea6ba1e.png?1521837740' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/277/866277-328662640f924a494379259d8fd865fe363b841a.jpeg?1521837754' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/594515-flatlay-the-photo-shop?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;FLATLAY®&quot;

And we’ve paid out over $40 million to our winners.</p><p>In our games and in our work we believe that fun is the secret to sustainable success. As such we care a lot about our culture and practice what we preach by making it enjoyable, social, and rewarding.</p><p>WayBetter is the rare company with a double bottom line: we succeed when our customers do.

People don’t approach Art+Logic to churn out routine apps; they come because they have something hard, often requiring research and skilled implementation.&nbsp;There is no better place than Art+Logic for software developers to do what they love — and also better hone their craft.</em>”</p><p><br>Job Type: 1099, rates ranging $35-$50/hour<br>Travel: None Required - Work from Home<br>Location: United States and Canada only</p><p><strong>Find out more at:</strong></p><ul><ul><li><a href='http://artandlogic.com/blog' rel='nofollow'>http://artandlogic.com/blog</a> (it's a<strong>&nbsp;tech blog</strong>, not a &quot;company&quot; blog)</li><li><a href='http://www.facebook.com/artandlogi' rel='nofollow'>www.facebook.com/artandlogic</a></li><li><a href='https://plus.google.coj/+ArtAndLogic' rel='nofollow'>https://plus.google.com/+ArtAndLogic</a></li><li><a href='http://www.artandlogic.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>http://www.artandlogic.com/careers/</a></li></ul></ul><p><strong>Have more questions?</strong>&nbsp;Email us at <a href='mailto:Recruiting@artandlogic.com' rel='nofollow'>Recruiting@artandlogic.com</a></p><p>Some things are best said multiple times. <strong>Please note&nbsp;your interest in this specific position, when applying.&nbsp;</strong>(You can do so&nbsp;in the &quot;Brag&quot; section.)</p>            </div>                            <h2>Benefits</h2>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual Conference</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                "

Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.</p><p>How we work:<br>* Happy Customers &gt; Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be &quot;pure.&quot;<br>* Vision &gt; GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.<br>* Writing &gt; Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.</p><p>We're working on:<br>* Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe).<br>* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.<br>* Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.</p><p>We work in San Francisco but are absolutely open to remote engineers. We'd love to hear from you!</p><p>Interested? Apply here: <a href='https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer</a></p></div>"

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.</p><p>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. That’s a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.</p><p><br></p> <p><strong>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?</strong></p><p>We're well-funded with significant traction; hundreds of thousands of families have downloaded the RoosterMoney app since our launch in January 2016 and we have over 51 currencies being used by children around the world. RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, Wall Street Journal, New Zealand Herald to name a few. We’ve been on CNBC and are considered experts in our field.</p><p>We are now expanding across a number of markets and looking for a talented and motivated senior UI developer to join our team to help us raise our game and achieve even more amazing things. We have a generous share option scheme as we believe that everyone within the company should share in the success they help build.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>THE ROLE:</strong></p><p>We're looking for a software developer who has held senior positions on front-end engineering teams, who will operate with a high level of autonomy, ensuring impeccable reliability. You care deeply about building applications with well thought out architecture.</p><p>You will be developing our core RoosterMoney app and working across the platform as a whole within our small but growing product team (currently 8), building an application that is used by families around the world. You have a passion for UX and UI, best practice development and building a product that delights users on a daily basis, taking pride in shipping quality code that is easy to test, maintain and build on. Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node API’s where required.</p><p>We are a small team so it’s important that the successful candidate isn’t just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apply if you want to:</strong></p><ul> <li>Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.</li> <li>Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.</li> <li>Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.</li> <li>Develop robust deployment and testing processes </li> <li>Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.</li> </ul><br><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br><p><strong>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> </strong></p><ul> <li>Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.</li> <li>25 days holiday</li> <li>Pension Scheme</li> <li>Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.</li> <li>We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office.

It is about a sophisticated hybrid app which merges video, audio, images and social media into one single place for the consumer. Part of the app are customized players, intelligent caching and offline availability of media data, social media features and a super modern UI with a great UX design.<br /><br />We are currently looking for talented developers on the global market to be a part of our team of developers, currently located in offices in Hamburg, Berlin, San Francisco and Rio de Janeiro. In addition, we are also open to opportunities for hiring developers from other cities around the globe to work remote on our devices.<br /><br />The project offers a series of challenges for being an iterative process, where we are always implementing and experimenting with features in a fast-paced environment. That promotes growth by giving you the responsibility to be always contributing with code that impacts directly the user experience.<br /><br />Technically, some of the main challenges involve dealing with multiple sources of media playback, managing and improving the many ways users can interact with these media (which are also conditioned by media types and app context, and maintaining and evolving the architecture, aiming to guarantee code that is well structured, solid and as accessible as possible for new developers, despite continually being changed by our iterative process."
