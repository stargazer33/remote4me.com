You’ll need a solid understanding of security threats and how to overcome them.\\n\\n* Previous experience in data is a plus, but most importantly you’re enthusiastic about data and how it can empower our customers to make good decisions.\\n\\n* You don’t wait to be told what to do.

We are looking for a full-time Android developer to improve our existing Android app and work on a build automation project.</p><p>Learn about who we are, what we’re looking for, and how you can grow with us!</p><p><strong>REQUIRED EXPERIENCE</strong></p><ul><li>A solid communicator.&nbsp;<strong>We are 100% remote</strong>&nbsp;and communication means everything.</li><li>Experienced in Java and Kotlin. Our codebase is mainly in Kotlin.</li><li>Care about good software architecture, testing, and automation. Our test coverage needs to be significantly improved.</li><li>Fair understanding of RxJava and Kotlin Coroutines. While we do not require high-level knowledge of RxJava, it is used in the current codebase.</li><li>At least basic knowledge of basic Material Design principles.</li><li>Interest in learning more about user behavior through use of analytics.</li><li>3+ years experience in Android software development.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT WE DO</strong></p><p>Events are where we go to be inspired by those who’ve followed their dreams, learn from successful people, build life-long friendships, and discover new opportunities.</p><p>Our mission at Sched is to empower teams to organize life-changing events. Thousands of events depend on Sched, like tech conferences, comic conventions, music festivals, yoga festivals, professional development days, and even furry conventions. Seriously, there is an event for everything.</p><p>You’ll be building something that makes a real difference to our customers. Here’s actual feedback about what you’ll be building:</p><ul><li>I wonder what the world did before Sched…</li><li>Sched completely revolutionized our convention.</li><li>Using Sched is something I actively LOOK FORWARD TO whenever we’re getting ready to put on another event.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL DO</strong></p><p>You will be the only Android engineer when you start. While you will take the lead in making most of the engineering decisions, collaboration remains a big part of your day-to-day. You will find yourself, for example, spending significant time communicating with your iOS counterpart to maintain a compatible feature set, with our support team to resolve with issues, and with the entire team on product roadmap discussions.</p><p>We keep track of progress through a loose kanban/loose agile project management approach. Each engineer is responsible for breaking down the tasks of their current project(s), laying out what they plan to implement in the cycle to-do list, and moving the task to “in-flight” when they are actively working on it.</p><p><strong>Your first two challenges in this position are to:</strong></p><ul><li>Stabilize and improve critical functionality in the existing android app.</li><li>Implement an automated build system for the Android app using iOS implementation as a rough reference.</li></ul><p><strong>PAY &amp; BENEFITS</strong></p><p>Salary is dependent on experience. Sched offers a broad suite of benefits to its employees including company-sponsored health, dental, vision, life, disability, and accidental dismemberment insurance. We offer retirement plans including a 401K and matching program. Other benefits include discretionary annual bonuses, education expenses, Paid Time Off, and other incentive programs.</p><p><strong>We are 100% remote! We get together throughout the year in incredible places like Morocco, Cambodia, and Medellín, all covered by Sched. Part work, part vacation, we call them #schedcations.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://sched.com/careers/android-engineer/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

This job is a great fit for pragmatic programmers with a functional bend.</p><p>Over the last few years, we’ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects, built full stack solutions leveraging Elixir and Phoenix, constructed models and data pipelines with Python and delighted our users utilizing in React, Native iOS and Android.</p><p>We do a lot.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p><p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions.</p><p>At Very, there is a never-ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year, we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p><p>You’ll spend the bulk your week (35 hours) designing and developing on a product or platform for one of our clients. The remainder can be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and/or participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p><p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p><p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools/platforms:</p><p><strong>Our Current Tooling</strong></p><ul><li>React &amp; React Native</li><li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li><li>Java &amp; Kotlin</li><li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Python</li><li>Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</li><li>Serverless</li><li>AWS</li></ul><p>You don’t need to be an expert in these tools, but familiarity is a plus. Our build teams operate with a very high degree of collaboration, so you will definitely have run-ins with these stacks throughout your time here.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p><p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, <strong>you can expect to make somewhere between $40,000 and $60,000 upon joining the company. </strong></p><p><strong>This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. </strong>We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in the continental United States. Thanks!</p><p><strong>Why work at Very?</strong></p><p>It’s not just about perks. It’s about solving tough problems and constantly learning, collaborating, and improving.</p><p><strong>What We Value</strong></p><p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p><p>We believe in empowering individuals to make an impact. Instead of having an org chart, we distribute authority through an approach called holacracy.</p><p><strong>Fairness</strong></p><p>We practice radical transparency, providing insight into all levels of the company, from financial performance to individual compensation.</p><p><strong>Balance</strong></p><p>We believe people do their best work when they have fulfilling lives outside of work. Ship great products, and we’ll give you the space to live your life.</p><p><strong>Yeah, but what about the perks?</strong></p><p><strong>Work where you want</strong></p><p><strong>Work from anywhere. Your home, our beautiful Chattanooga office, a co-working space, on the road, you name it. If you feel like moving, you don’t have to change jobs.</strong></p><p><strong>Level up your skills</strong></p><p>We’ll cover $2,000 annually for you to attend conferences, take courses, or learn something new. Plus we pay 100% of travel and registration costs for employees who speak at conferences. We also reserve time for internal projects and professional development.</p><p><strong>Paid parental leave</strong></p><p>When you welcome a new baby, we encourage you to take time off to bond with your child. We offer generous maternity and paternity leave for all new parents.</p><p><strong>Medical and fitness</strong></p><p>We believe that healthy bodies power healthy minds. We have many health, vision, and dental plans available through UHC, and we currently contribute a large portion to each plan. We also pay up to $70/month for your gym membership, yoga classes, or whatever you do to stay fit.</p><p><strong>401k match</strong></p><p>We match $1 for every $3 contributed up to $18,000.</p><p><strong>Home office stipend</strong></p><p>All remote employees may expense up to $60/month of their Internet service costs. Additionally, remote employees get a $1,000 home office stipend in their first year and $200/year for each subsequent year.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.verypossible.com/careers/senior-sofware-enginer-latam' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

The ambition to learn new things and continuously improve is a requirement. We are looking for someone to join us for the long term in providing the best possibles services to our customers.   <br>   <br>Voipfone runs a virtual office, meaning all our employees work from home (09:00 to 17:30 UK time), so self-motivation and reliability are essential qualities.

You will be responsible for writing documentation, as well as liaising with colleagues in the support teams to ensure end-users are provided with the best possible experience.   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>   <br>Given the nature of the projects you’ll be working on, you will require a good understanding of the following:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Programming GUIs   <br>   <br>* Cross-platform development   <br>   <br>* iOS development   <br>   <br>* Android development   <br>   <br>* macOS development   <br>   <br>* Windows development   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>While not essential, the following skills would certainly prove useful:   <br>   <br>   <br>* An eye for GUI design   <br>   <br>* Experience with frameworks such as React Native   <br>   <br>* Git version control   <br>   <br>* Knowledge of various network protocols   <br>   <br>* SIP   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>STRICTLY NO RECRUITMENT AGENCIES  </div> </div>",

And yet, while the interview is a universal experience, it has never been recognized as its own discipline. In fact, the vast majority of people conducting interviews receive no formal training in how to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Karat is the market leader in Interview Engineering</strong>\n<p>At Karat, our mission is to make every interview predictive, fair, and enjoyable. To do so, we created and established the category of Interview Engineering.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2014, Karat is a privately held and venture-funded company based in Seattle. Key clients include Pinterest, PayPal, Citrix, Intuit, and InVision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Interview Engineering at Karat</strong>\n<p>Karat Interview Engineers are a community of experienced software developers who are equipped with best practices and technology needed to provide the most predictive, fair, and enjoyable interviews to software engineering job candidates. Interview Engineers include software development managers, software engineers, and freelancers covering the full technology stack. As an Interview Engineer, you will interview job candidates using the Karat approach and interviewing infrastructure in a wide variety of roles on behalf of leading companies worldwide.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Flexible, high impact work that is compensated at highly competitive rates.</strong>\n<p>As an Interview Engineer, you will be compensated at highly competitive rates for your interviewing expertise. &nbsp;The time commitment is flexible—many of our interviews happen on nights and weekends. &nbsp;Some experts do 10 interviews/week while others do over 25 interviews/week. &nbsp;You can work from anywhere, anytime. &nbsp;You will sharpen your interviewing skills and transform the interviewing experience for every candidate and company. Interviews are paid on a per interview basis. $100 USD per interview (60 minute interview + up to 30 minutes for the feedback report)</p>\n<p> Experienced software engineers who believe that interviewing is a first-class job Interviewing experience focused on evaluating fundamental computer science skills (i.e. data structures, algorithms etc.), software craftsmanship (i.e. understanding of unit testing, source control, APIs etc.), and/or specific technologies (i.e. iOS, distributed systems etc.) Strong oral and written communication skills Able to empathize with candidates and provide actionable feedback A genuine desire to continuously improve the Karat service and technical interviewing</p>\n<strong>About You</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p> In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital/domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at Karat.</p>\n<em></em>\n<strong>Statement of Non-Discrimination:</strong>\n<br>\n<p>We value a diverse workforce: people of color, womxn, and LGBTQIA+ individuals are strongly encouraged to apply.</p>\n<p>With thanks to the Level Playing Field Institute for this statement of non-discrimination.</p>\n<div> \n <a href='https://grnh.se/4c9420f62' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>\n</div>",

Podcasts are unique in that they inspire us, help us learn something new, or captivate us with the way stories are told. Yet, all of these experiences are rarely shared with one another. By connecting people with an easy way to share and discuss podcasts, Repod helps people find and listen to great podcasts.</p>\n<p>Currently, we are a two person team (2 cofounders) and are looking for our 1st full-time team member by way of mobile engineer. We are in the midst of a public beta and will be launching in the near future.</p>\n<p>As the lead mobile engineer at Repod, you'll initially be working in our main repo developing and launching new features. Repod is built using React Native and relies heavily on a native audio player built in Swift/Java. As we expand our product, you’ll help inform the technologies used in our future growth. The team is small, which means your impact on the company’s success will be instrumental.</p>\n<p>We have one requirement — must love podcasts.</p>\n<p>Interested?
