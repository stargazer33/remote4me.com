As organizations collect and store more data to drive their businesses forward, they are simultaneously increasing&nbsp;their risk and liability. TrueVault removes 100 percent of that liability and ensures compliance with regulations such as HIPAA, GDPR, and the California Privacy Act.</p><p>TrueVault delivers brutally tough data security and seamless portability that empowers organizations and developers to build meaningful applications for its consumers. We're eliminating the false choice between data security and data accessibility.</p><p>Lastly, we are engineers. We build things. TrueVault is designed to be easy to use for the people who are responsible for the doing. Based in Silicon Valley, we are passionate about creating powerful tools so that developers can build incredible things.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who is TrueVault?</strong></p><p>TrueVault is a Y Combinator graduated startup based in Silicon Valley. We have an incredible group of investors including Paul Buchheit, Mark Pincus, and Bill Tai who have invested more than $3 million dollars because they deeply believe in our mission. We are a group of engineers passionate about data security, API performance, and building products that developers like us love to use. We are looking for a handful of engineering MacGyvers to join our founding team. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why join TrueVault?</strong></p><p>At TrueVault, you will have the opportunity to work in arguably the biggest market opportunity of this coming decade, improve the collection, portability, and security of really critical data, and push the envelop of data portability forward. You’ll work on things that haven't been done before. Plus you’ll get to choose what you want to work on and develop products that your peers will rely on and love using.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to work at a place that values &quot;getting things done&quot; more than &quot;working the startup hours,&quot; talk to us. If you take pride in what you do and care about the people who use the product, you’ll find people just like you here.

Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.</p><p>How we work:<br>* Happy Customers &gt; Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be &quot;pure.&quot;<br>* Vision &gt; GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.<br>* Writing &gt; Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.</p><p>We're working on:<br>* Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe).<br>* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.<br>* Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.</p><p>We work in San Francisco but are absolutely open to remote engineers. We'd love to hear from you!</p><p>Interested? Apply here: <a href='https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer</a></p></div>",

We will only ever ask for more of your time if we think you are a potentially good fit, rather than waste your time having you jump through unnecessary hoops.</p><p><strong>Will I get a job immediately after applying?</strong></p><p>If your skills, experience, and values align with a current opening we have, your chances of getting hired immediately are high. If we discover you're qualified, but all opportunities have been taken, we'll continue to work with you to help you get a role in X-Team. The key is having the most relevant, in-demand skills when you apply.</p>            </div>                            <h3>Benefits</h3>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Get the chance to work with big brands</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Live and work in one of our roaming hacker houses around the world</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work from anywhere as part of a community of digital nomads</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Join our vibrant community</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We provide up to $2,500 in funding for your growth &amp; wellbeing</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Gym reimbursement</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We custom build our hardware and software that connects to our growing fleet of hybrid cars. Our geeks write smart algorithms to increase car sharing utilisation and operational efficiency ensuring customer happiness. We leverage big data collected through thousands of trips to aid in decision making. Smove run both a B2C operation in addition to key B2B partnerships over the years with Uber, Singapore Government (Ministry of Manpower) and most recently with Grab.</p><p>Smove gives people without cars the ability to hire one when they need it, at short notice from their mobile phone in just 3-5 clicks. They like it because they can pick up the car from an ordinary parking location and drop it off wherever is convenient.</p><p>For the future, smove plans to offer to licence its technology to car fleet operators in urban locations outside Singapore, likely franchising a package to sell mobility as a service, giving operators the ability to create utility-like services for transportation of people &amp; goods anywhere.</p><p><strong>“Nothing happens in a start-up company until you do it”</strong></p><p>Smove is a young company that thrives on a clear vision to make cities more liveable and to solve all pain points around vehicle ownership by developing a service model around mobility &amp; transportation.</p><p>We are very ambitious, but also know that great things will take time and there are no shortcuts to building a lasting and sustainable business with a great culture.</p><p>If you are a thinker-doer &amp; self-starter, bring a growth mindset and you keep challenging yourself by building something meaningful, please continue reading. If you are able to thrive in an environment without clear-cut processes and even better, able to create lean, agile &amp; innovative processes yourself, this job is for you.</p><p><strong>THE CHALLENGE</strong></p><p>Acting as lead Android developer,&nbsp;you will be working alongside the iOS platform team.

Since launching our Beta in July 2017, customers like Github, Shopify, Unity, are using Abstract to manage their design workflow. Abstract is a technically ambitious product and we’re looking forward to seeing how you can contribute to these goals. The best candidates will be capable and enthusiastic about building out a world-class team and product with us. <br> <br>At Abstract, we are actively working to build a diverse and inclusive organization. Here, diversity includes age, economic class, educational background, ethnic variance, familial status, gender, gender expression, gender identity, marital status, national origin, religious affiliation, sex, sexual orientation, transgender status, or veteran status. <br> <br>Abstract is headquartered in San Francisco and is backed by Amplify Partners, Cowboy Ventures, First Round Capital, Scale Venture Partners and others. We announced our $16MM series B funding in May 2018.<br><br>----<br> <br>Abstract is looking for an engineering manager to help lead our growing Desktop team. At Abstract we develop desktop and web applications that help teams design with confidence by providing a version control system and collaboration platform focused on design artifacts.<br> <br>At Abstract we lead by serving our teams with empathy, knowledge, and coordination. Our engineering team is very distributed within the U.S., so experience working remotely is ideal, but not necessarily required.<br> <br>As a Desktop team lead we're more interested in your experience with leadership than your experience with Objective-C or Go, but some experience with Objective-C, Go, or a similarly compiled systems programming language is a skill we think will help you lead your team.<br> <br>Benefits<br>At Abstract, we offer resources that emphasize personal and familial well-being. We provide 99% healthcare coverage, including dental, vision, and life insurance. We offer 10 weeks parental leave, unlimited paid-time off, and flexible working arrangements.<br> <br>To help employees plan for the future, we're able to offer competitive pay and a 401k program. New teammates receive a MacBook Pro. <br> <br>We are a distributed team and we are able to offer US-based remote employment for most roles. We offer travel opportunities for company gatherings, team meet-ups, and the occasional conference.<br> <br> <br>Notes<br>Though we're a distributed team, we're currently only able to hire US-based candidates.<br> <br>As part of our security protocols, offers are contingent on successful completion of a background check. <h2>Responsibilities</h2>In a typical week as a Software Engineering Team Lead, you will:* Join the engineering leadership team in discussing and planning projects. You’ll be working with a growing group of engineering leads with extensive startup backgrounds on setting the direction for our engineering team and the entire company.* Lead a staff meeting of your team discussing project status, new projects, and ongoing Desktop development improvements we can make. Help your team members collaborate with each other to improve our Desktop code.* Get to know and help your direct reports by meeting with them one on one.* Help us grow the engineering team by interviewing and hiring new engineers.<h2>Requirements</h2>Practical skills you'll need for success:* Empathy. You see your team members first and foremost as people with inestimable worth and you always operate from that basis.* Strong communication. Our team leads are primarily communicators, so you've got to the the kind of person who succeeds on your skills with both writing and speaking.* Organization. You're someone who creates structures to organize the information you're receiving.* Coordination. You're someone who is good at connecting people to help them get their jobs done, and at connecting knowledge.* Experience. You’ve been an engineer and while maybe you’re not writing code day-to-day, you’re able to hold your own discussing strategy and architecture with engineers. You’ve worked with Objective-C, Go, or another systems programming language.Bonus points if you have:* Worked as a team lead at a very small company that transitioned to a larger company* Worked extensively with git. Even more bonus points if you’ve also worked with git’s internals<p><strong>Location:</strong> United States</p><p>See more jobs at <span>Abstract</span></p></div></div>",

We're looking for someone who knows algorithms, a few different languages, distributed systems, REST servers, Linux configuration, and maybe even some machine learning.

Our customers are sky diving operations, big auto industry players, and zip line operators. What they all have in common is that they want to use our cameras to capture their client's experiences and then use our software to automatically turn all that footage into a great final edited video that they can sell to their customers. Our auto editing software is fast: a final rendered video is ready less than two minutes after the client has completed the experience!

Universe is built to empower everyone to create their own home on the internet.<br><br>We're looking for an iOS developer to help accelerate our mission. You'll take on tasks throughout the stack. You will expand the editor: adding new block types, more complex layouts, and more customizations for each block. You will help build tools that are easy for everyone to understand, so that buying a domain, setting up metadata, and adding pages are super simple. And you will advance our Magic Builder, a personalized design “assistant” that generates a unique site by asking you just a few questions. <br><br>Our app is native, taking advantage of the many frameworks Apple gives us. It is built entirely with Swift. The bulk of the user data is stored in CloudKit though we do maintain a few of our own APIs. We're hoping to convert those APIs from node.js to Swift soon, so experience with Vapor or Kitura is a bonus ;). We use programatic autolayout for the majority of our UI. We do believe in Unit Tests, but we don't have enough yet.<br><br>This is a full time position and 100% remote. Experience working remotely is definitely a bonus. We offer health benefits and generous vacation because everyone needs to recharge their batteries.<br><br>We're looking for someone sharp, internally-driven, and passionate about building powerful tools for everyone.&nbsp;</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/195634?reset=False&amp;ra=13BNd2T27N4Y&amp;oqs=a%3D13BNd2T27N4Y' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Universe</h3>            <div><p>Universe&nbsp;is the first website builder designed for mobile.

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.</p><p>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. That’s a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.</p><p><br></p> <p><strong>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?</strong></p>RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, FT, Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Australian Herald to name a few. Hundreds of thousands of families have downloaded the RoosterMoney app since our launch in January 2016. We are looking for a talented and motivated senior UI developer to join our team to help us achieve even more amazing things. We have a generous share option scheme and you’ll be joining us as we expand across a number of new territories. <p><br></p><p><strong>THE ROLE:</strong></p><p>We're looking for a software developer who has held mid-senior positions on front-end engineering teams, who will operate with a high level of autonomy. </p><p>You will be developing our core RoosterMoney app and working across the platform as a whole within our small but growing product team (currently 8), building an application that is used by families around the world. You have a passion for UX and UI, best practice development and building a product that delights users on a daily basis, taking pride in shipping quality code that is easy to test, maintain and build on. You care deeply about building applications with well thought out architecture.</p><p><br></p><p> Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node API’s where required.</p><p><br></p><p>We are a small team so it’s important that the successful candidate isn’t just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apply if you want to:</strong></p><ul> <li>Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.</li> <li>Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.</li> <li>Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.</li> <li>Develop robust deployment and testing processes </li> <li>Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.</li> </ul><br><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br><p><strong>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> </strong></p><ul> <li>Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.</li> <li>25 days holiday</li> <li>Pension Scheme</li> <li>Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.</li> <li>We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office. We run a Remote working structure as a team (we currently have team members in London, Bristol and Stoke in the UK and Barcelona, Spain) so time zone variance (and travel distance) has to be sensible. </li> </ul><p><br></p><p>We can't offer visa sponsorship at this time. </p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/200492?reset=False&amp;ra=15eNWoq1EZXO&amp;oqs=a%3D15eNWoq1EZXO' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>            <h3>About RoosterMoney</h3>            <div><p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roostermoney.com%2F' rel='nofollow'>RoosterMoney</a> takes children from their first steps in understanding the value of money to their first bank account.

We help users all over the world discover the best hiking and biking routes, working to empower everybody to explore more of the great outdoors. And we’re good at what we do: Google and Apple have listed us as one of their Apps of the Year numerous times—and we are consistently ranked amongst the highest-grossing apps in both Google Play and the App Store. <br><br>One key driving factor to our growth has always been our understanding that a technological approach can provide an outdoor experience far beyond the possibilities of traditional services.
