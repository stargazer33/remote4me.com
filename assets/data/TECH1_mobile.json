With over 20 million enthusiastic customers in 195 countries, TeamSnap has quickly become one of the fastest-growing team and group management solutions on the planet.\\n\\nWe value trust, communication and fun more than big company policies and rules, and we thrive on empowering our employees instead of controlling them.

We’re passionate about helping our customers spend less time organizing and more time playing.\\n\\n**Benefits and Perks**\\nWe offer competitive salary and benefits, lots of opportunity to develop professionally, and the ability to demonstrate what you can achieve. TeamSnap is still small enough that your actions will help drive our success. Benefits include:\\n* Competitive salary\\n* Equity\\n* Medical/dental/vision for you and your family\\n* Education reimbursement up to $1,500/yr\\n* Wellness stipend of $50/mo\\n* 401K\\n* Up to $300/yr to donate to charitable causes\\n* Free TeamSnap service for your family and friends\\n* Free TeamSnap swag\\n* Flexible PTO and vacation policy\\n\\n**Diversity and Inclusion**\\nTeamSnap is a company built around trust, kindness and collaboration, where diverse backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints are celebrated and valued.

Do you have a stackoverflow profile? A hacker news profile? Do you tweet? Write about technical things on Medium? Contribute to open source in any way?</p><br /><p>- At least 3 years of professional experience</p><br /><p>- Live somewhere in the UK and can make it to Birmingham occasionally.</p><br /><p>- Have lots of ideas and a willingness to share them!</p><br /><p>- We&rsquo;re a startup so things can be chaotic. As well as being able to write good, clean code you&rsquo;ll need to be able to solve problems on a daily basis using your own initiative. Flexibility and resilience are key! If you&rsquo;re smart, friendly and love building software&mdash;we want to hear from you.</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>We&rsquo;ve boot-strapped the beta version with the help of contractors &ndash; so we&rsquo;re in the scrappy early stages. As we're pre-revenue the budget is limited. But the beta is ready and the business plan is written. And you&rsquo;ll be working with a founder who has raised an A-round of &pound;300k for an earlier project. The role will initially be part-time or on a contract basis. We're raising a round, we'll make you full time and pay you a full-time salary when we do.</p><br /><p>As a key partner, you'll get a generous share option package from the start to reflect your time and commitment in the fundraising.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Where you&rsquo;ll work </strong></p><br /><p>Although we&rsquo;re based in Birmingham and will need to see you in person from time to time, you can work remotely the rest of the time.</p>",

You'll join one of our cross-functional product team and will be its proud iOS representative.</p><p>There are plenty of challenges each of them are tackling at the moment such as:</p><ul><li>Driver: create a scalable and reliable platform used by dozen of thousands of drivers on a daily basis</li><li>Payment: make in-app payment management easy as pie for users.</li><li>Ride flow: improve our ride flow by making it more modular while we are expanding in new countries with completely different approaches of using the product</li></ul><p>... and many others!</p><p><strong>Does it sound like you?</strong></p><ul><li>You have more than 5 years of experience in iOS development.</li><li>You also have at least 2 years of experience in using Reactive programming.</li><li>You've already worked with Swift in Production.</li><li>You understand the iOS SDK and application lifecycle.</li><li>You've got knowledge in common architectural patterns.</li><li>You're skilled in UI using AutoLayout.</li><li>You're thorough when it comes to test coverage and other best practices.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points ;)</strong></p><ul><li>If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.</li><li>If you know about managing the lifecycle of background services and their impact on battery usage, it would also be a bonus.</li></ul><p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p><ul><li>Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features. </li><li>Work in a release train cycle (we ship often ).</li><li>Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of iOS drivers</li><li>Be a vital member of the broader iOS team at Heetch and contribute to core architecture and design discussions.</li><li>Work closely with engineers from other product teams building cross-team features at scale.</li><li>Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues.</li><li>Share knowledge with everyone and help your team to grow.</li><li>Have the freedom to experiment.

This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li><li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>What's next?</strong></p><p>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps:</p><ol><li>Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30)</li><li>Take home assignment (~5 days deadline)</li><li>Interview with your future teammates (1h)</li><li>Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders</li></ol>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/heetch/92f1292d-f8ee-41a2-9c05-79d6dc250835?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=StackOverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Heetch</h4>            <div><p>Heetch is a mobility app with a simple mission: We want people to enjoy going out.<br>Every night and every day, our drivers are doing their best to make their rides unforgettable and friendly!

We are hiring a senior Android developer to rewrite our Video/WebRTC recording app (and beyond).</p><p><strong>We have a functioning Android app, but it needs a full rewrite to:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Improve stability.</strong>&nbsp;Lookback is known for being rock-solid, and our Android app needs to up the game.</li><li><strong>Prepare for the future.</strong>&nbsp;We have product developments to push into the app further down the line.</li><li><strong>Great Android “feel”.</strong>&nbsp;The app should showcase a strong Android UI experience.</li></ul><p>To do this, we need you to have lots of experience in developing Android apps. We like&nbsp;<strong>Kotlin and functional reactive programming</strong>, but are open to pushing the envelope. We extensively use Video and WebRTC technologies: some experience in that is good, but we also have in-house devs in this area to guide you.</p><p>Our Android app works, but our current developer has shifted priorities, hence we want to recruit.</p><p>We offer competitive salaries, stock options, a 401(k) with a 4% match, health insurance that is 100% covered by us, and 30 days of vacation per year which we expect you to use.</p><p>We have a small but highly competent team of engineers and a hands-off management culture. And we love building tech.</p><p><strong>The position will be based remote in Europe or North America.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://lookback.io/jobs/android-developer-2019/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
