Universe is built to empower everyone to create their own home on the internet.<br><br>We're looking for an iOS developer to help accelerate our mission. You'll take on tasks throughout the stack. You will expand the editor: adding new block types, more complex layouts, and more customizations for each block. You will help build tools that are easy for everyone to understand, so that buying a domain, setting up metadata, and adding pages are super simple. And you will advance our Magic Builder, a personalized design “assistant” that generates a unique site by asking you just a few questions. <br><br>Our app is native, taking advantage of the many frameworks Apple gives us. It is built entirely with Swift. The bulk of the user data is stored in CloudKit though we do maintain a few of our own APIs. We're hoping to convert those APIs from node.js to Swift soon, so experience with Vapor or Kitura is a bonus ;). We use programatic autolayout for the majority of our UI. We do believe in Unit Tests, but we don't have enough yet.<br><br>This is a full time position and 100% remote. Experience working remotely is definitely a bonus. We offer health benefits and generous vacation because everyone needs to recharge their batteries.<br><br>We're looking for someone sharp, internally-driven, and passionate about building powerful tools for everyone.&nbsp;</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/195634?reset=False&amp;ra=13BNd2T27N4Y&amp;oqs=a%3D13BNd2T27N4Y' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Universe</h3>            <div><p>Universe&nbsp;is the first website builder designed for mobile.

Currently, we’re looking for developers with&nbsp;mobile development&nbsp;experience, for possible, upcoming projects.</p><p>Our project teams usually consist of 1-5 developers plus UX/UI design and dedicated QA. Since we create custom software, our projects often involve different technologies and industries, so there is always something to new to learn.

We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management.

Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.</p><p>How we work:<br>* Happy Customers &gt; Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be &quot;pure.&quot;<br>* Vision &gt; GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.<br>* Writing &gt; Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.</p><p>We're working on:<br>* Data capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe).<br>* Real-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies and reflect up-to-the-minute data. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.<br>* Data visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.</p><p>We work in San Francisco but are absolutely open to remote engineers. We'd love to hear from you!</p><p>Interested? Apply here: <a href='https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer' rel='nofollow'>https://heapanalytics.com/jobs#engineer</a></p></div>",

This is a great opportunity for highly skilled software engineers to do well-paid, flexible work, on your own schedule.<br><br>Triplebyte's mission is to help engineers find great jobs by assessing their abilities without relying on the prestige of their resume credentials. Part of our evaluation process for our candidates is a technical interview, where engineers demonstrate a variety of skills and abilities. We're looking for people to help us administer those interviews. We'll pay $200 per two-hour technical interview.<br><br>## Responsibilities<br><br>Our interviewer team is responsible for conducting technical interviews with candidates who pass our online quiz. Each interview is around two hours long, and interviewers are allowed to set their own availability. Triplebyte will fill your schedule for you, so all you need to focus on is providing a good experience for and accurately assessing each candidate. Once you've finished grading an interview, you've finished -- no remaining to-do tasks.<br><br>## Requirements<br><br>This role is a best fit for solid engineers with deep knowledge and skill in many different areas. The work is part time, with a flexible schedule. Preparation for it will involve intensive, full-time training on site, with us, in San Francisco. You'll work with our custom interview processes and interviewing software. We've done thousands of hours of interviews - we're experts, and we'll expect you to be an expert before you can administer interviews on our behalf.<h2>Requirements</h2>## How to ApplyIf you're interested, please sign up here: [https://triplebyte.com/remote_interviewer](https://triplebyte.com/remote_interviewer?ref=remoteok).
