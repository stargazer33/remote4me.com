We're also expanding to other spaces like tax, so as to make it financially accessible for anybody who juggles multiple gigs, or is just pursuing a dream on their own.</p><p>As a business, we sit on a unique position and have partnerships with a ton of giant companies who want to better serve their workforce. It's rare that a startup has a good mission and a good business, but here we are.</p><p>On the engineering side, we use Node, Python, Swift, Postgres, Akka and some cool machine learning models you're going to love hearing about. More particularly on Android, we're moving towards Kotlin at a fast pace (40% of our codebase is Kotlin already, all new code is Kotlin) and we use a state-of-the-art MVI architecture that's great to work on. Your work will be feature-heavy, and you'll have tons of say on its architecture and infrastructure.</p><p>We have a beautiful office in SOMA (San Francisco) close to South Park, but we also support and nurture remote workers. We offer fantastic benefits (after all, it's our product!) and you'll be surrounded by the most driven, smartest people I know. We have a supportive, productive culture that's respectful of your own personal time and well-being.</p><p><a href='https://www.stridehealth.com/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://www.stridehealth.com/careers</a> but hit me up at pedro.tabio at stridehealth.com and let's talk :)</p>",

Using a novel decentralized PKI, Celo lets you send cryptocurrency to phone numbers in a fully decentralized way.

Anyone can participate in the network and earn Celo currency, even with just a budget Android smartphone (by sending verification text messages).

We believe that people should have all their data without sacrificing their privacy, and this can be achieved through a good product with excellent user experience. \\n\\nWe have 14 people aboard, we work remotely and passionately. All our works are open sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/MixinNetwork). We are always welcoming new heroes to join us to build Mixin Network and Messenger together.\\n\\n## The Product\\n\\nMixin Network is a public distributed ledger for digital assets, almost all popular crypto assets can be transferred in Mixin Network. Unlike other blockchain projects, they aims at a distributed OS with complicated programming capabilities, Mixin focuses on the transferring of digital assets. The simplicity has given Mixin the ability to irreversibly confirm transactions in seconds. \\n\\nThe mainnet has been running since Feb 2019 and processed millions of real Bitcoin transactions. Compared to a similar project Bitcoin Lightning Network, Mixin has more than 1200 BTC in the network and much much more active transactions.\\n\\nMixin Messenger is a unique digital wallet and end-to-end encrypted messenger built on Signal protocol. We see it as an important entrance to Mixin Network, to help people transfer all their crypto assets and their messages securely.\\n\\n## The Job\\n\\nMost of our engineers are somewhat full-stack engineers, and with focus on some specific platforms. 3 on server, 3 on Android, 2 on iOS, 2 on deskotp, 2 on web, and of course they have some interleaves.\\n\\nNow we are expecting you to have excellent skills in web technology, and the passion to build open source project with great user experience. You will mainly have three kind of works to focus, but you are free to choose some new one.\\n\\n1. Open data visualization. Our code is open source, and Mixin Network is a public ledger. So we need to build an explorer for it.\\n2. Create the framework for Mixin Messenger bot. Our Messenger has many active users, they use many popular bots, but we still don't have an bot framework for developers. You may create the framework to help developers creating better bots.\\n3. Build useful and interesting bots. We build our own bots for both internal use and public use, some are just showcases maybe.\\n\\nIf you are interested and confident with your skills and passion, please don't hesitate to contact me.  </div> </div>",

We believe that people should have all their data without sacrificing their privacy, and this can be achieved through a good product with excellent user experience. We have 14 people aboard, we work remotely and passionately. All our works are open sourced at [GitHub](https://github.com/MixinNetwork). We are always welcoming new heroes to join us to build Mixin Network and Messenger together.## The ProductMixin Network is a public distributed ledger for digital assets, almost all popular crypto assets can be transferred in Mixin Network. Unlike other blockchain projects, they aims at a distributed OS with complicated programming capabilities, Mixin focuses on the transferring of digital assets. The simplicity has given Mixin the ability to irreversibly confirm transactions in seconds. The mainnet has been running since Feb 2019 and processed millions of real Bitcoin transactions. Compared to a similar project Bitcoin Lightning Network, Mixin has more than 1200 BTC in the network and much much more active transactions.Mixin Messenger is a unique digital wallet and end-to-end encrypted messenger built on Signal protocol. We see it as an important entrance to Mixin Network, to help people transfer all their crypto assets and their messages securely.## The JobMost of our engineers are somewhat full-stack engineers, and with focus on some specific platforms. 3 on server, 3 on Android, 2 on iOS, 2 on deskotp, 2 on web, and of course they have some interleaves.Now we are expecting you to have excellent skills in web technology, and the passion to build open source project with great user experience. You will mainly have three kind of works to focus, but you are free to choose some new one.1. Open data visualization. Our code is open source, and Mixin Network is a public ledger. So we need to build an explorer for it.2. Create the framework for Mixin Messenger bot. Our Messenger has many active users, they use many popular bots, but we still don't have an bot framework for developers. You may create the framework to help developers creating better bots.3. Build useful and interesting bots. We build our own bots for both internal use and public use, some are just showcases maybe.If you are interested and confident with your skills and passion, please don't hesitate to contact me.",

Everyone has a stake in the company.\\n\\n**About Us**\\nTeamSnap&nbsp; (www.teamsnap.com) is an award-winning mobile and web service for managing recreational and competitive sports teams and groups. With over 20 million enthusiastic customers in 195 countries, TeamSnap has quickly become one of the fastest-growing team and group management solutions on the planet.\\n\\nWe value trust, communication and fun more than big company policies and rules, and we thrive on empowering our employees instead of controlling them. We’ve been named to Outside Magazine’s list of Best Places to Work the last three years.\\n\\n**What You’ll Be Doing**\\nAs a strong Android developer (duh) you’ll generate creative ideas on how to harness the power of mobile apps to help players, coaches, group leaders and parents to interact with their sports teams and social groups.

We’re passionate about helping our customers spend less time organizing and more time playing.\\n\\n**Benefits and Perks**\\nWe offer competitive salary and benefits, lots of opportunity to develop professionally, and the ability to demonstrate what you can achieve. TeamSnap is still small enough that your actions will help drive our success. Benefits include:\\n* Competitive salary\\n* Equity\\n* Medical/dental/vision for you and your family\\n* Education reimbursement up to $1,500/yr\\n* Wellness stipend of $50/mo\\n* 401K\\n* Up to $300/yr to donate to charitable causes\\n* Free TeamSnap service for your family and friends\\n* Free TeamSnap swag\\n* Flexible PTO and vacation policy\\n\\n**Diversity and Inclusion**\\nTeamSnap is a company built around trust, kindness and collaboration, where diverse backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints are celebrated and valued. This is a place where everybody belongs.\\n\\n# Responsibilities\\n **Some things that are pretty important:**\\n\\n* Very strong understanding of Java, Kotlin and Android development\\n* 7+years development experience\\n* Solid experience with common libraries such as Retrofit, RxJava and Dagger\\n* Strong understanding of the full mobile development life cycle\\n* Deep architectural expertise on the Android platform and exposure to various design and architectural patterns\\n* Solid experience with the latest Android SDK’s; including Architecture Components\\n* Have published one or more Android apps in the Google Play Store\\n* Working knowledge of the general mobile landscape, architectures, trends, and emerging technologies\\n* Experience with Git, GitHub, and good version control practices\\n* Experience working on a self directed agile team\\n* Ability to work as part of a geographically-distributed development team\\n* Flexibility, teamwork, sense of humor and the willingness to do what's necessary to help a relatively small company grow quickly \\n\\n# Requirements\\nOther things that are nice to have:\\n\\n* Firebase and Firestore know how\\n* Exposure to automated build tools such as Jenkins.\\n* Experience with offline operation, caching strategies and data synchronization.\\n* Skilled in interfacing with API’s and third party libraries, including JSON REST API’s (take a look at https://developer.teamsnap.com)\\n* Ability to read and understand Ruby and Rails code (our back-end code)\\n* Be a parent, coach or participant in a recreational sport\\n* Be a TeamSnap user (sign up for a free trial to see what we’re about)\\n* Ability to talk to animals, Doctor Doolittle-style \\n\\n#Location\\n- US-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

If you&rsquo;re smart, friendly and love building software&mdash;we want to hear from you.</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>We&rsquo;ve boot-strapped the beta version with the help of contractors &ndash; so we&rsquo;re in the scrappy early stages. As we're pre-revenue the budget is limited. But the beta is ready and the business plan is written. And you&rsquo;ll be working with a founder who has raised an A-round of &pound;300k for an earlier project. The role will initially be part-time or on a contract basis. We're raising a round, we'll make you full time and pay you a full-time salary when we do.</p><br /><p>As a key partner, you'll get a generous share option package from the start to reflect your time and commitment in the fundraising.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Where you&rsquo;ll work </strong></p><br /><p>Although we&rsquo;re based in Birmingham and will need to see you in person from time to time, you can work remotely the rest of the time.</p>",
