We're also expanding to other spaces like tax, so as to make it financially accessible for anybody who juggles multiple gigs, or is just pursuing a dream on their own.</p><p>As a business, we sit on a unique position and have partnerships with a ton of giant companies who want to better serve their workforce. It's rare that a startup has a good mission and a good business, but here we are.</p><p>On the engineering side, we use Node, Python, Swift, Postgres, Akka and some cool machine learning models you're going to love hearing about. More particularly on Android, we're moving towards Kotlin at a fast pace (40% of our codebase is Kotlin already, all new code is Kotlin) and we use a state-of-the-art MVI architecture that's great to work on. Your work will be feature-heavy, and you'll have tons of say on its architecture and infrastructure.</p><p>We have a beautiful office in SOMA (San Francisco) close to South Park, but we also support and nurture remote workers.

Our software engineers tackle hard problems in streaming calculation, storage and distributed computing, leveraging the latest features in Java 11, Kotlin, and PostgreSQL.</p><p>Our company is 100% remote and proud of it. You can work anywhere in the US or Europe, but we require an overlap of 8am-noon Pacific working hours. We use a variety of collaboration tools, like Zoom and Slack, which makes us feel like we’re in the same building together. We have a stacked team of kind-hearted, talented engineers that love to collaborate, teach each other new tricks, and build products that far exceed our customers’ expectations.</p><p>Our technology stack is largely Java and Kotlin on the backend and TypeScript, AngularJS, and React on the frontend. The core of our product is a full-featured calculation engine that can perform complex math and execute machine learning algorithms on streaming time series data.</p><p>I am not the hiring manager, but involved with many parts of the interviewing processing, and happy to answer any questions. Feel free to contact me with questions at stephen.rosenthal@seeq.com (but please do not email applications to me).</p><p>To apply, go to <a href='https://www.seeq.com/about/careers' rel='nofollow'>https://www.seeq.com/about/careers</a></p>",

Using a novel decentralized PKI, Celo lets you send cryptocurrency to phone numbers in a fully decentralized way. Additionally, Celo uses stable-value tokens pegged to fiat currencies, like the US Dollar, to minimize volatility. Anyone can participate in the network and earn Celo currency, even with just a budget Android smartphone (by sending verification text messages). To make sure that the platform is scalable and fast enough for day-to-day use, Celo uses a new Proof-of-Stake blockchain protocol with fast block times and one block finality, and has a novel light client protocol that uses SNARK-based proofs to sync with the chain quickly. For Celo's first product, we are working with organizations such as the UN World Food Programme and GiveDirectly on a social payments and cash transfer app.</p><p>Investors: Andreessen Horowitz (a16z), Polychain, General Catalyst, Coinbase, Reid Hoffman and Jack Dorsey, among others.</p><p>Stack: Typescript, Solidity, Go, React Native, Python, Android, iOS, Rust, zk-SNARKs</p><p>Team backgrounds: Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Square, Zcash, QEDIT, MIT, Stanford</p><p>More about us here:</p><p>Blog - <a href='https://medium.com/celohq' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/celohq</a></p><p>Repos - <a href='https://github.com/celo-org' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/celo-org</a></p><p>Mobile App (alpha release): <a href='https://celo.org/app' rel='nofollow'>https://celo.org/app</a></p><p>SDK: <a href='https://docs.celo.org/celo-sdk' rel='nofollow'>https://docs.celo.org/celo-sdk</a></p>",

The simplicity has given Mixin the ability to irreversibly confirm transactions in seconds. \\n\\nThe mainnet has been running since Feb 2019 and processed millions of real Bitcoin transactions. Compared to a similar project Bitcoin Lightning Network, Mixin has more than 1200 BTC in the network and much much more active transactions.\\n\\nMixin Messenger is a unique digital wallet and end-to-end encrypted messenger built on Signal protocol. We see it as an important entrance to Mixin Network, to help people transfer all their crypto assets and their messages securely.\\n\\n## The Job\\n\\nMost of our engineers are somewhat full-stack engineers, and with focus on some specific platforms. 3 on server, 3 on Android, 2 on iOS, 2 on deskotp, 2 on web, and of course they have some interleaves.\\n\\nNow we are expecting you to have excellent skills in web technology, and the passion to build open source project with great user experience. You will mainly have three kind of works to focus, but you are free to choose some new one.\\n\\n1. Open data visualization. Our code is open source, and Mixin Network is a public ledger. So we need to build an explorer for it.\\n2. Create the framework for Mixin Messenger bot. Our Messenger has many active users, they use many popular bots, but we still don't have an bot framework for developers. You may create the framework to help developers creating better bots.\\n3. Build useful and interesting bots. We build our own bots for both internal use and public use, some are just showcases maybe.\\n\\nIf you are interested and confident with your skills and passion, please don't hesitate to contact me.  </div> </div>",

You will mainly have three kind of works to focus, but you are free to choose some new one.1. Open data visualization. Our code is open source, and Mixin Network is a public ledger. So we need to build an explorer for it.2. Create the framework for Mixin Messenger bot. Our Messenger has many active users, they use many popular bots, but we still don't have an bot framework for developers. You may create the framework to help developers creating better bots.3. Build useful and interesting bots. We build our own bots for both internal use and public use, some are just showcases maybe.If you are interested and confident with your skills and passion, please don't hesitate to contact me.",

With over 20 million enthusiastic customers in 195 countries, TeamSnap has quickly become one of the fastest-growing team and group management solutions on the planet.\\n\\nWe value trust, communication and fun more than big company policies and rules, and we thrive on empowering our employees instead of controlling them.

We’re passionate about helping our customers spend less time organizing and more time playing.\\n\\n**Benefits and Perks**\\nWe offer competitive salary and benefits, lots of opportunity to develop professionally, and the ability to demonstrate what you can achieve. TeamSnap is still small enough that your actions will help drive our success. Benefits include:\\n* Competitive salary\\n* Equity\\n* Medical/dental/vision for you and your family\\n* Education reimbursement up to $1,500/yr\\n* Wellness stipend of $50/mo\\n* 401K\\n* Up to $300/yr to donate to charitable causes\\n* Free TeamSnap service for your family and friends\\n* Free TeamSnap swag\\n* Flexible PTO and vacation policy\\n\\n**Diversity and Inclusion**\\nTeamSnap is a company built around trust, kindness and collaboration, where diverse backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints are celebrated and valued.

If you&rsquo;re smart, friendly and love building software&mdash;we want to hear from you.</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>We&rsquo;ve boot-strapped the beta version with the help of contractors &ndash; so we&rsquo;re in the scrappy early stages. As we're pre-revenue the budget is limited. But the beta is ready and the business plan is written. And you&rsquo;ll be working with a founder who has raised an A-round of &pound;300k for an earlier project. The role will initially be part-time or on a contract basis. We're raising a round, we'll make you full time and pay you a full-time salary when we do.</p><br /><p>As a key partner, you'll get a generous share option package from the start to reflect your time and commitment in the fundraising.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Where you&rsquo;ll work </strong></p><br /><p>Although we&rsquo;re based in Birmingham and will need to see you in person from time to time, you can work remotely the rest of the time.</p>",

You'll join one of our cross-functional product team and will be its proud iOS representative.</p><p>There are plenty of challenges each of them are tackling at the moment such as:</p><ul><li>Driver: create a scalable and reliable platform used by dozen of thousands of drivers on a daily basis</li><li>Payment: make in-app payment management easy as pie for users.</li><li>Ride flow: improve our ride flow by making it more modular while we are expanding in new countries with completely different approaches of using the product</li></ul><p>... and many others!</p><p><strong>Does it sound like you?</strong></p><ul><li>You have more than 5 years of experience in iOS development.</li><li>You also have at least 2 years of experience in using Reactive programming.</li><li>You've already worked with Swift in Production.</li><li>You understand the iOS SDK and application lifecycle.</li><li>You've got knowledge in common architectural patterns.</li><li>You're skilled in UI using AutoLayout.</li><li>You're thorough when it comes to test coverage and other best practices.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points ;)</strong></p><ul><li>If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.</li><li>If you know about managing the lifecycle of background services and their impact on battery usage, it would also be a bonus.</li></ul><p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p><ul><li>Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features. </li><li>Work in a release train cycle (we ship often ).</li><li>Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of iOS drivers</li><li>Be a vital member of the broader iOS team at Heetch and contribute to core architecture and design discussions.</li><li>Work closely with engineers from other product teams building cross-team features at scale.</li><li>Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues.</li><li>Share knowledge with everyone and help your team to grow.</li><li>Have the freedom to experiment.

This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li><li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers.

We extensively use Video and WebRTC technologies: some experience in that is good, but we also have in-house devs in this area to guide you.</p><p>Our Android app works, but our current developer has shifted priorities, hence we want to recruit.</p><p>We offer competitive salaries, stock options, a 401(k) with a 4% match, health insurance that is 100% covered by us, and 30 days of vacation per year which we expect you to use.</p><p>We have a small but highly competent team of engineers and a hands-off management culture. And we love building tech.</p><p><strong>The position will be based remote in Europe or North America.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://lookback.io/jobs/android-developer-2019/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",
