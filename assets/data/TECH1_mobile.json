We're looking for someone who knows algorithms, a few different languages, distributed systems, REST servers, Linux configuration, and maybe even some machine learning. If you want to be designing novel algorithms in C++ one day, writing Kotlin server code to expose your new algorithm as a REST endpoint the next, and then configuring the production deployment the day after that, then this is the opportunity for you!</p><p>Revl makes auto-editing software and smart action cameras. Our customers are sky diving operations, big auto industry players, and zip line operators. What they all have in common is that they want to use our cameras to capture their client's experiences and then use our software to automatically turn all that footage into a great final edited video that they can sell to their customers. Our auto editing software is fast: a final rendered video is ready less than two minutes after the client has completed the experience!

pioneering a new security technology called &quot;BiTSentry&quot; that stops malware and reduces the risk of vulnerabilities starting with the 2 billion devices powered by Android.</p><p>Unlike our competitors, BiTSentry is 100% effective at mitigating the risk of malware because we assume everything is a threat up front.  We do not detect or predict anything.  We isolate everything.</p><p>Our technology includes a microkernel, super lightweight virtual machine manager (hypervisor) and encryption management designed to replace the vulnerable and large (14M+ lines of code) linux kernel that Android is built on.  Our microkernel is &lt; 100K lines of code, resulting in a super small attack surface and secure foundation for Android.  This is the first step.  </p><p>Next, we change how executables run on Android so that every application and its data, regardless if its a system app or one you download, runs in its own isolated environment.  </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Diego</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Android</span>, <span>Tablets</span>, <span>Cyber Security</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/secureduniverse' rel='nofollow'>@secureduniverse</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://blog.secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>http://blog.secureduniverse.com</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>secureduniverse.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Secured Universe</h3><ul><li><div>Design Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/73428-ui-ux-jedi' rel='nofollow'>UI/UX Jedi</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69253-virtualization-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Virtualization Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69254-full-stack-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Full Stack Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69401-machine-learning-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Machine Learning Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/73426-kernel-hacker' rel='nofollow'>Kernel Hacker</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Operations Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69045-cfo-co-fundraiser' rel='nofollow'>CFO &amp;

We do not detect or predict anything.  We isolate everything.</p><p>Our technology includes a microkernel, super lightweight virtual machine manager (hypervisor) and encryption management designed to replace the vulnerable and large (14M+ lines of code) linux kernel that Android is built on.  Our microkernel is &lt; 100K lines of code, resulting in a super small attack surface and secure foundation for Android.  This is the first step.  </p><p>Next, we change how executables run on Android so that every application and its data, regardless if its a system app or one you download, runs in its own isolated environment.  </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>San Diego</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Android</span>, <span>Tablets</span>, <span>Cyber Security</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/secureduniverse' rel='nofollow'>@secureduniverse</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://blog.secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>http://blog.secureduniverse.com</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://secureduniverse.com' rel='nofollow'>secureduniverse.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Secured Universe</h3><ul><li><div>Design Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/73428-ui-ux-jedi' rel='nofollow'>UI/UX Jedi</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69250-aosp-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>AOSP Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69253-virtualization-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Virtualization Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69401-machine-learning-software-engineer' rel='nofollow'>Machine Learning Software Engineer</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/73426-kernel-hacker' rel='nofollow'>Kernel Hacker</a><div>San Diego·Full Time<span></span><span>·$40K – $120K · 0.0% – 5.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Secured Universe</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Operations Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/secured-universe/jobs/69045-cfo-co-fundraiser' rel='nofollow'>CFO &amp;

to build a storefront in seconds. The platform provides tools to create and distribute original content paired to capsule collections with an emphasis on driving traffic to shops that generate sales. The apps and site allow users to intuitively curate collections from multiple affiliate networks to build pop-up stores connected to “window-fronts”. Users generate revenue on organic and sponsored posts (see gif below) while brands can seed products to content creators supported by campaign performance analytics via an admin panel.  </p><p>The service amplifies reach by providing embeddable window-fronts (aka flatlay cards) as customized dynamic units for premium publishers to serve content as native placements. It’s commissioned content crowdsourced as sponsored editorial — the power of actionable creative at scale. </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Los Angeles</span>, <span>Berlin</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Digital Media</span>, <span>Mobile Advertising</span>, <span>Image Recognition</span>, <span>Cryptocurrency</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/flatlayapp' rel='nofollow'>@flatlayapp</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://github.com/FLATLAY' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/FLATLAY</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://www.flat-lay.com' rel='nofollow'>flat-lay.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/750/662/750662-550f531bfe84fcacb5e40b6ec2e6ed40a142ee44.png?1475532585' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/493/752493-acf9b3f4c25088b99966d2391f4d8b6bca78fc7c.jpg?1475917752' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/494/752494-f333e8bd7cccbeda5d26e7039a28caf00042de0a.png?1475918143' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/618/752618-d0ab9c5aba91e1f4fb3eefc0f9c6f6dad94d48da.png?1475966575' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/790/387/790387-0f86ee1d3bea48c10f739d1dd9359ddfc0948afa.png?1487320328' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/790/388/790388-10e4042f20b7d144da58fb1fe4d3f191033fbcb4.png?1487320343' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/837/413/837413-3636a99f0809afde0ab2bfd181577f39ffc25b72.png?1507154302' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/837/414/837414-860b6064cf13754231ef38d34a4b2343614b9460.png?1507154392' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/271/866271-f06ff8dd6acc547f18e631073fb6840927d6bb9f.jpeg?1521837553' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/272/866272-5fbbea7e6de533e26f65186342a3d810451ad7d1.jpeg?1521837580' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div></div><div><span>See More</span></div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/273/866273-af3ccfbd7b524b520f8b577d329c4292ec2748f5.jpeg?1521837624' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/274/866274-e960a7ac458f977611c4459baf2b4c341387595e.png?1521837640' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/275/866275-008eafc2c3f4ddd80c40301e27275c0d7bb40ec6.png?1521837726' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/276/866276-d224cedf6c0daadb0d20c487b3e65906eea6ba1e.png?1521837740' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/277/866277-328662640f924a494379259d8fd865fe363b841a.jpeg?1521837754' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/594515-flatlay-the-photo-shop?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;FLATLAY®&quot;

The platform provides tools to create and distribute original content paired to capsule collections with an emphasis on driving traffic to shops that generate sales. The apps and site allow users to intuitively curate collections from multiple affiliate networks to build pop-up stores connected to “window-fronts”. Users generate revenue on organic and sponsored posts (see gif below) while brands can seed products to content creators supported by campaign performance analytics via an admin panel.  </p><p>The service amplifies reach by providing embeddable window-fronts (aka flatlay cards) as customized dynamic units for premium publishers to serve content as native placements. It’s commissioned content crowdsourced as sponsored editorial — the power of actionable creative at scale. </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Los Angeles</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Digital Media</span>, <span>Mobile Advertising</span>, <span>Image Recognition</span>, <span>Cryptocurrency</span></div><div><div></div><a href='https://twitter.com/flatlayapp' rel='nofollow'>@flatlayapp</a></div><div><div></div><a href='https://github.com/FLATLAY' rel='nofollow'>https://github.com/FLATLAY</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://www.flat-lay.com' rel='nofollow'>flat-lay.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/750/662/750662-550f531bfe84fcacb5e40b6ec2e6ed40a142ee44.png?1475532585' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/493/752493-acf9b3f4c25088b99966d2391f4d8b6bca78fc7c.jpg?1475917752' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/494/752494-f333e8bd7cccbeda5d26e7039a28caf00042de0a.png?1475918143' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/752/618/752618-d0ab9c5aba91e1f4fb3eefc0f9c6f6dad94d48da.png?1475966575' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/790/387/790387-0f86ee1d3bea48c10f739d1dd9359ddfc0948afa.png?1487320328' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/790/388/790388-10e4042f20b7d144da58fb1fe4d3f191033fbcb4.png?1487320343' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/837/413/837413-3636a99f0809afde0ab2bfd181577f39ffc25b72.png?1507154302' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/837/414/837414-860b6064cf13754231ef38d34a4b2343614b9460.png?1507154392' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/271/866271-f06ff8dd6acc547f18e631073fb6840927d6bb9f.jpeg?1521837553' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/272/866272-5fbbea7e6de533e26f65186342a3d810451ad7d1.jpeg?1521837580' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div></div><div><span>See More</span></div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/273/866273-af3ccfbd7b524b520f8b577d329c4292ec2748f5.jpeg?1521837624' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/274/866274-e960a7ac458f977611c4459baf2b4c341387595e.png?1521837640' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/275/866275-008eafc2c3f4ddd80c40301e27275c0d7bb40ec6.png?1521837726' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/276/866276-d224cedf6c0daadb0d20c487b3e65906eea6ba1e.png?1521837740' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/866/277/866277-328662640f924a494379259d8fd865fe363b841a.jpeg?1521837754' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/projects/594515-flatlay-the-photo-shop?src=startup_profile' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a title=&quot;FLATLAY®&quot;

We're self-funded and doing this for 6.5 years. We believe in what we do, and are committed to the team and our value proposition. We give back plenty but are not able to compensate interns financially.</p><p>RiteKit interns share insights on the team, experience, career boosts: <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a></p><p>At our core:<br>&quot;Enhance&quot;: this feature is the gem at the center the RiteBoost automation dashboard and RiteForge, the social publishing SaaS. </p><p>The customer's customized &quot;Enhance&quot; does any/all of the following in one click: <br>• semantically determines topics of a post and auto-hashtags them for current and historical engagement <br>• Auto-emojify<br>• converts URLs in social posts to a custom tiny URL with a baked-in advertisement<br>• if the words in your post are not good as hashtags, Enhance adds up to two at the end of the post<br>• extracts a good image from images embedded in the body of a page, if the page's URL is in your post<br>• optional: highlight text or add &quot;quotes&quot; around text before Enhancing - this makes an image from the text, with a customer-branded image background.<br>• author attribution<br>• even more options are available</p><p>We serve enterprise customers, too: <a href='https://ritekit.com/api-demo' rel='nofollow'>https://ritekit.com/api-demo</a></p><p>We're growing fast, gaining traction, we're going big, and all the while, our culture continues to improve. No one works &quot;for&quot; RiteKit; we listen, mentor, involve people in the decision making. We work &quot;with&quot; people not above them. Please feel welcome to ask any of us to explain what the difference means to to them. See Hashtag Academy in Medium to see their interviews and read what they say about our impact on careers.</p><p>What do our interns do after us? Search RiteTag in LinkedIn, then do an advanced  search to see the people. Our interns either join the team or have moved on to PopSugar, Google, Snapchat and so on.</p><p>Our four SaaS products in 60 seconds: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply to RiteKit</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to RiteKit</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Job Description</h3></div><div><div><p>All RiteKit internships are unpaid. If you are not considering internships that are without salary or stipend, etc., this is not for you. </p><p>FIRM REQUIREMENTS:<br>•  64 bit Mac / Macbook / Hackintosh core i7 preferred<br>•  Must write clean, re-usable code (we will test you)<br>•  3 months X 20 hours/week commitment<br>•  Our internships are UNPAID. No salary, no stipend, etc. <br>•  Desire to work in a startup environment, able to self-manage and work remotely* <br>•  Must have built at least two Android and/or iOS apps with Flutter<br>•  Git experience<br>* Remotely = you would work as we all do, from home or where we live.</p><p>Beneficial but not required:<br>•  Fluency with Java<br>•  Basic understanding of Android extensions/custom keyboards<br>•  TDD/Testing frameworks awareness (JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, etc.)</p><p>We greatly limit the number of interns we work with in each division. Applications are now being taken for start dates 1~3 months from now.</p><p>Hashtags, yay!</p><p>No, that's not what we do. </p><p>So, what DO we do? <br>Data-driven, machine learning-infused social media engagement SaaS products. Please spend one minute to get a quick understanding of all four of our tools: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo' rel='nofollow'>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYKPrk2U4Jo</a> </p><p>• Total social media optimization - avoid paying for ads by intelligently automating everything shared to social with images, GIFs, emojis, influencer-tagging. Come up in social search, get curated and republished, and make a visual impact as well.<br>•  Hashtags that are recommended based on current engagement and outcomes, rather than whether they are &quot;trending&quot; (trending = many accounts sending posts with a hashtag; it says nothing about positive outcomes).<br> <br>What you will experience:<br>•  Building both Android and iOS applications with Flutter<br>•  Learn from mentors and peer feedback in a fast paced distributed startup team<br>•  Brainstorm and implement app features<br>•  Build the fully functional app from start to finish<br>•  Exposure to Rest APIs<br>•  We make you part of the process, so you can earn how to bootstrap your own startup, in case you want to do that<br>•  We ship fast - and with over 250,000 registrations, when put your latest feature into production, your work will be seen and become part of the workflow for thousands of business people.<br> <br>* As a self-funded startup, we have been extremely lucky to have a passionate team, advisors and friends who have brought us this far. Unfortunately this also means we can only offer unpaid internships at the time. Should you be selected for a first interview, please do ask what our interns go on to do, either as RiteKit salaried staff or after RiteKit. We'll give you ways to research this.</p><p>Do ask what our former interns went on to do immediately following their RiteKit internship when you have your first interview (and how to independently research this).<br> <br>First, see <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/tagged/ritekitinterns</a> and especially the video in <a href='https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845' rel='nofollow'>https://medium.com/hashtag-academy/ritekit-interns-tell-their-stories-acc09f4e1845</a> to hear from our former interns, who share what they got from the experience, in learning, career-boosts, jobs and other opportunities, both with RiteKit and other employers.</p></div></div><div><div>Skills</div><div>Java, Android, Git, Mac OS X, Dart, TDD,

Universe is built to empower everyone to create their own home on the internet.<br><br>We're looking for an iOS developer to help accelerate our mission. You'll take on tasks throughout the stack. You will expand the editor: adding new block types, more complex layouts, and more customizations for each block. You will help build tools that are easy for everyone to understand, so that buying a domain, setting up metadata, and adding pages are super simple. And you will advance our Magic Builder, a personalized design “assistant” that generates a unique site by asking you just a few questions. <br><br>Our app is native, taking advantage of the many frameworks Apple gives us. It is built entirely with Swift. The bulk of the user data is stored in CloudKit though we do maintain a few of our own APIs. We're hoping to convert those APIs from node.js to Swift soon, so experience with Vapor or Kitura is a bonus ;). We use programatic autolayout for the majority of our UI. We do believe in Unit Tests, but we don't have enough yet.<br><br>This is a full time position and 100% remote. Experience working remotely is definitely a bonus. We offer health benefits and generous vacation because everyone needs to recharge their batteries.<br><br>We're looking for someone sharp, internally-driven, and passionate about building powerful tools for everyone.&nbsp;</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/195634?reset=False&amp;ra=13BNd2T27N4Y&amp;oqs=a%3D13BNd2T27N4Y' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div><div>                                                                                                                                                            </div>            <h3>About Universe</h3>            <div><p>Universe&nbsp;is the first website builder designed for mobile.

Simple, progressive and gameful, we bring to life all the sound traditional financial principles we were brought up with (or wish we were!) and make managing money smart, fun &amp; relevant for the modern world.</p><p>We believe the world would be a better place if we all talked about money a little earlier on in life. Research shows that our money habits are formed by the age of seven. That’s a pretty amazing opportunity to help give kids a head-start in building habits that will stick with them for life.</p><p><br></p> <p><strong>WHY ROOSTERMONEY?</strong></p>RoosterMoney has been featured in The Times, Telegraph, Guardian, FT, Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Australian Herald to name a few. Hundreds of thousands of families have downloaded the RoosterMoney app since our launch in January 2016. We are looking for a talented and motivated senior UI developer to join our team to help us achieve even more amazing things. We have a generous share option scheme and you’ll be joining us as we expand across a number of new territories. <p><br></p><p><strong>THE ROLE:</strong></p><p>We're looking for a software developer who has held mid-senior positions on front-end engineering teams, who will operate with a high level of autonomy. </p><p>You will be developing our core RoosterMoney app and working across the platform as a whole within our small but growing product team (currently 8), building an application that is used by families around the world. You have a passion for UX and UI, best practice development and building a product that delights users on a daily basis, taking pride in shipping quality code that is easy to test, maintain and build on. You care deeply about building applications with well thought out architecture.</p><p><br></p><p> Aside from developing front-end applications, we expect you will also become involved with ops and back-end work with our Node API’s where required.</p><p><br></p><p>We are a small team so it’s important that the successful candidate isn’t just technically highly competent but is a good cultural fit. We run daily stand-ups, two week sprint cycles, retrospectives and utilise Slack for Chat and Jira for ticket and stream management. We use video calls to stay in contact and monthly all team meetings (State of the Rooster). We gather together every quarter for All Hands to celebrate successes, share ideas and plan for the next quarter of hustle.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Apply if you want to:</strong></p><ul> <li>Work closely with a small group of determined, like-minded people to reshape the way families talk and engage with money around the world.</li> <li>Play a critical role in the design and development of our app.</li> <li>Ship and take ownership of impactful new features and functionality.</li> <li>Develop robust deployment and testing processes </li> <li>Share your knowledge and passion with the rest of the team in making the app best in class.</li> </ul><br><p><strong>Benefits</strong></p><br><p><strong>In addition to a competitive salary:<br> </strong></p><ul> <li>Work with a fun, passionate team building something awesome.</li> <li>25 days holiday</li> <li>Pension Scheme</li> <li>Employee Option Scheme so you can benefit for all the input you put into the company.</li> <li>We will consider remote working for this role so long as you can spend up to 20% of your time in our London Bridge Hub office. We run a Remote working structure as a team (we currently have team members in London, Bristol and Stoke in the UK and Barcelona, Spain) so time zone variance (and travel distance) has to be sensible. </li> </ul><p><br></p><p>We can't offer visa sponsorship at this time. </p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/197745?reset=False&amp;ra=14jGCFLm37dm&amp;oqs=a%3D14jGCFLm37dm' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a></div>            <h3>About RoosterMoney</h3>            <div><p><a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roostermoney.com%2F' rel='nofollow'>RoosterMoney</a> takes children from their first steps in understanding the value of money to their first bank account.

Your work will empower over 8,000 businesses around the world to provide exceptional, human customer service, while supporting the other senior engineers on your team.</div><div><h3>Tools we use</h3></div><ul><li>Kotlin, Java, Pusher, AWS, Firebase</li><li>Slack, Trello, Jira, Github, Travis</li></ul><div><h3>About the role</h3></div><ul><li>Our engineering team is currently thirty-seven people, just over half the company. You will be working on our five-person mobile team which includes another Android engineer, two other iOS engineers and a designer. You’ll be involved in every decision made regarding implementation, testing, and backlog prioritization.</li><li>A separate team of engineers owns the back end API endpoints, so your work will be mostly focused on the app, SDK implementation, and design details. You’ll also get everything you need from the design team with regard to Android-specific visual design and interactions.</li><li>You’ll work with customers and QA testers to ensure releases meet customer demands and our high quality bar.</li><li>Our engineering teams work in two-week iterations, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/agile-remote-teams/' rel='nofollow'>remote, agile development</a>. When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with tests and tag your team for review - using video and screen-sharing as needed. Your development builds can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li><li>Everything is secondary to the&nbsp;<i>customer experience</i>. We expect you to have a keen sense of how your code will impact the experience in terms of performance, security and usability.</li><li>You'll be working with product people that challenge you to get better every day. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy work that moves the needle for businesses around the world.</li><li>You are located between UTC-5 and UTC+1. For example, you could work 9-5 from either Nova Scotia/Boston/Brazil or UK/France/Nigeria.</li></ul><div><h3>About you</h3></div><ul><li>You bring a level of Android-specific expertise that will help us craft an outstanding experience for customers and fellow Android app developers. You have years of experience working with Android and Java, but you are excited to develop primarily in Kotlin.</li><li>You have a great understanding of how “always online” products like Help Scout communicate with web services in an unpredictable Android reality. You can help us design everything to fail gracefully and leverage local storage to provide customers with a seamless offline / online experience.</li><li>You delight not only in the way an application works, but in how it looks, and have an excellent understanding of Android interaction design and how to create a perfect user experience.</li><li>You stay up-to-date on the Android platform and can provide insightful advice about leveraging native platform APIs or evaluating and leveraging wrappers.</li><li>You have experience digging through crash reports and metrics to find ways to incrementally improve your apps.</li><li>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea. You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.</li><li>You’re a great communicator and have an excellent command of written and spoken English. As a remote company, we rely on clear communication for collaboration and execution.</li><li>You are helpful and empathetic and care about building on our company culture that embraces these qualities.</li></ul><div><h3>Benefits</h3></div><ul><li><span>Competitive Salary</span>&nbsp;- We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well.

You won’t find any ping-pong tables or kegerators here. Instead, you’ll be surrounded by driven, supportive teammates who will push you to be better. We take work/life harmony seriously, too, as we want every career at Help Scout to be a long and satisfying one.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</span></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/diversity-inclusion/' rel='nofollow'>diversity and inclusion</a>.

Our goal is to craft a wonderful experience for our Android app users and also make it easy for Android developers to add Help Scout capabilities to their apps. Your work will empower over 8,000 businesses around the world to provide exceptional, human customer service, while supporting the other senior engineers on your team.</div><div><h3>Tools we use</h3></div><ul><li>Kotlin, Java, Pusher, AWS, Firebase</li><li>Slack, Trello, Jira, Github, Travis</li></ul><div><h3>About the role</h3></div><ul><li>Our engineering team is currently thirty-seven people, just over half the company. You will be working on our five-person mobile team which includes another Android engineer, two other iOS engineers and a designer. You’ll be involved in every decision made regarding implementation, testing, and backlog prioritization.</li><li>A separate team of engineers owns the back end API endpoints, so your work will be mostly focused on the app, SDK implementation, and design details. You’ll also get everything you need from the design team with regard to Android-specific visual design and interactions.</li><li>You’ll work with customers and QA testers to ensure releases meet customer demands and our high quality bar.</li><li>Our engineering teams work in two-week iterations, communicate mostly via Slack and are committed to&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/agile-remote-teams/' rel='nofollow'>remote, agile development</a>. When you are ready, you’ll create and send a pull request with tests and tag your team for review - using video and screen-sharing as needed. Your development builds can be easily tested on environments that closely match production. You’ll work autonomously for the most part and we trust you to get work done when/where you can be productive.</li><li>Your team performs engineering support when a question can’t be answered by our in-house support team and passes triage. We’ll get you up-to-speed with engineering support so you can help our customers and improve the product along the way.</li><li>Everything is secondary to the&nbsp;<i>customer experience</i>. We expect you to have a keen sense of how your code will impact the experience in terms of performance, security and usability.</li><li>You'll be working with product people that challenge you to get better every day. The founders are technical and committed to creating a magical experience for customers. You'll deploy work that moves the needle for businesses around the world.</li><li>You are located between UTC-5 and UTC+1. For example, you could work 9-5 from either Nova Scotia/Boston/Brazil or UK/France/Nigeria.</li></ul><div><h3>About you</h3></div><ul><li>You bring a level of Android-specific expertise that will help us craft an outstanding experience for customers and fellow Android app developers. You have years of experience working with Android and Java, but you are excited to develop primarily in Kotlin.</li><li>You have a great understanding of how “always online” products like Help Scout communicate with web services in an unpredictable Android reality. You can help us design everything to fail gracefully and leverage local storage to provide customers with a seamless offline / online experience.</li><li>You delight not only in the way an application works, but in how it looks, and have an excellent understanding of Android interaction design and how to create a perfect user experience.</li><li>You stay up-to-date on the Android platform and can provide insightful advice about leveraging native platform APIs or evaluating and leveraging wrappers.</li><li>You have experience digging through crash reports and metrics to find ways to incrementally improve your apps.</li><li>You believe remote teams are the future of work, or are at least excited about the idea. You have experience working with remote teams or can adjust your work/management style to be remote-friendly.</li><li>You’re a great communicator and have an excellent command of written and spoken English. As a remote company, we rely on clear communication for collaboration and execution.</li><li>You are helpful and empathetic and care about building on our company culture that embraces these qualities.</li></ul><div><h3>Benefits</h3></div><ul><li><span>Competitive Salary</span>&nbsp;- We pay at or above market salary in most cases and evaluate a lot of research to make sure everyone is paid well. The formula we use to calculate all salaries is public to employees and is improved upon regularly.</li><li><span>Health and dental insurance</span>&nbsp;- We cover you and your family's health/dental insurance 100%. If you are based in the US, we'll cover you on our Aetna policy. If you're based outside the US, we offer a healthcare stipend.</li><li><span>Long-term/Short-term Disability Insurance &amp; Life Insurance</span>&nbsp;- We cover 100% of the premiums for LT/ST Disability insurance and base Life Insurance. You also have the option to purchase supplementary life insurance through our provider. (currently US only)</li><li><span>Flexible vacation</span>&nbsp;- Take time off when you need it, we trust you.</li><li><span>Paid parental leave, including adoption and foster care&nbsp;</span>- 12 weeks for primary caretaker and 4 weeks for secondary caretaker.</li><li><span>401k with 1% match&nbsp;</span>- via Betterment for Business (currently US only)</li><li><span>Personal Development stipend</span>&nbsp;- Up to $1,800 per year to improve your craft</li><li><span>Great tools</span>&nbsp;- Each employee will be provided with a Mac laptop and 27'' display (or equivalent equipment of choice).</li><li><span>Home Office Stipend</span>&nbsp;- You'll also receive $1,000 to spend on outfitting your home office, as well as up to $350 a month to rent a co-working space if you like.</li><li><span>Complete transparency</span>&nbsp;- Everyone has full access to business metrics and financial information about the company.</li></ul><div><span><br></span></div><div>About Us</div><div><br></div><div>Help Scout is made by roughly 75 people in 40+ cities around the world, all with a passion for excellence in their craft.</div><div><br></div><div>We come from diverse backgrounds and are united by an enthusiasm for great products and delightful customer experiences.</div><div><br></div><div>Since launching in April of 2011, Help Scout now powers 8,000+ support teams in over 140 countries.

While growth is important, team and values are paramount. We’re always striving to do impactful work we’re proud of in lieu of chasing overnight success.</div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re builders without borders</span></div><div><br></div><div>Our entire team is free to work remotely from wherever they choose. We overcome remote challenges through transparency, trust, and video conferencing. The reward is worth the effort—we’ll take talent, skill, and diverse perspectives over local geography any day.</div><div><br></div><div>Above all, we want Help Scout to be a place where passionate people can do their very best work. You won’t find any ping-pong tables or kegerators here. Instead, you’ll be surrounded by driven, supportive teammates who will push you to be better. We take work/life harmony seriously, too, as we want every career at Help Scout to be a long and satisfying one.</div><div><br></div><div><span>Diversity &amp; Inclusion</span></div><div>We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates&nbsp;<a href='https://www.helpscout.net/blog/diversity-inclusion/' rel='nofollow'>diversity and inclusion</a>.

UX research highlighted the fact that mom’s suffer from “baby brain” at 3 am when they can’t think but have to remember such things as “what side did I last feed from?” The UI accommodates quick glances and 1-tap logging to relieve friction during those early morning feedings. Future growth for this product includes making an &quot;enterprise edition&quot; for day care centers.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Hollywood</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Parenting</span>, <span>Productivity Software</span>, <span>Health and Wellness</span></div><div><div></div><a href='http://twitter.com/eatsleeppoopapp' rel='nofollow'>@eatsleeppoopapp</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://EatSleepPoopApp.com' rel='nofollow'>EatSleepPoopApp.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/798/621/798621-e367e42bda4b5351a14aeb811b433cf11122105c.png?1490200975' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Add testimonials, product launches, and photos that highlight your company</div>Add Highlight</div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at Eat Sleep Poop App</h3><ul><li><div>Software Engineering Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/eat-sleep-poop-app/jobs/294664-android-engineer-as-tech-founder' rel='nofollow'>Android Engineer as Tech Founder</a><div>Hollywood·Cofounder<span></span><span>·No Salary · 10.0% – 12.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to Eat Sleep Poop App</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Eat Sleep Poop App Team</h3><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/sergibosch-me-com' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/sergibosch-me-com' rel='nofollow'>Sergi Bosch</a><span>,</span></div><div>UX Designer.

The videos/media are stored on the CRUMZ cloud database and opened when physically ‘geo-triggered’ by followers of the videos author or any CRUMZ user if the video is set as Public.  CRUMZ users may also create end-to-end encrypted messages that attach to the media to foment conversations.  Think &quot;Communication Safe-Zones&quot;</p><p>Users may also &quot;Shake&quot; the phone to enter (AR) mode.  Visual representations in the form of avatars, stickers or emojis in live camera mode represent a portal to view the same media in the CRUMZ “Home” feed.  Geofences are represented visually as digital circles painted around these emojis.<br> <br>The current backend architecture for the Crumz prototype runs a Java / MySQL stack.  It consists of a series of REST based endpoints to support the iOS (Swift)  client.  The current end points are built on top of an open source Java framework.  </p><p>**Contact for the technical description of the job.</p><p>This is an equity only position until the funding round is

TrndStar is a social platform that was built for creative individuals to share their talents in a fun, unique, and interactive setting.</p><p>2. For the first time, ever TrndStar users will be able to compete and collaborate with each other. This will give the artist a chance to go head to head with other users and have their respective followers vote, comment, rate, and share. As well as giving them an opportunity to collaborate with an artist that they wouldn't normally be able to work with.</p><p>3. With these unique features, TrndStar will allow users the ability to leverage other users to grow their following and fanbase. This will allow them to gain followers 10 times faster than any other social platform.</p><p>4. Trndstar isn't exclusive to just artists and people wanting to share their talents. But anyone will be able to share videos and photos with their family and friends. </p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Hiring in <span>Baltimore</span>, Remote OK</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div>1-10 Employees</div><div></div></div><div><div></div><span>Mobile</span>, <span>Social Media</span>, <span>Online Video Advertising</span></div><div><div></div><a href='http://twitter.com/@Trndstar16' rel='nofollow'>@Trndstar16</a></div><div><div></div><a href='http://Trndstar.com' rel='nofollow'>Trndstar.com</a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/747/575/747575-4712ca312d22c7e3b959d9263e717e5ebac8c6ae.png?1474829210' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/747/576/747576-40ee996d741d3c1543dae6a9fe305f879b354cfc.png?1474829322' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/747/577/747577-6b6c90bc242e6a61af422ec8cb9ed9ed23fd7fa2.png?1474829570' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/747/578/747578-a7e5d364fb89b44dfd5fdf897697b5f1437fa6fa.png?1474829574' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><a href='https://d2gn4xht817m0g.cloudfront.net/p/product_screenshots/images/original/000/747/585/747585-4cb2fd870b53222cca27b520a1b9bd6f12036a00.png?1474832071' rel='nofollow'></a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div></div><div>Add testimonials, product launches, and photos that highlight your company</div>Add Highlight</div></div></div><div></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>Other Jobs at OVER Technology</h3><ul><li><div>Design Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/over-technology/jobs/174232-mobile-ui-designer' rel='nofollow'>Mobile UI Designer</a><div>Baltimore·Contract<span></span><span>·$5K – $8K · 1.0% – 3.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to OVER Technology</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Operations Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/over-technology/jobs/260820-co-founders' rel='nofollow'>Co-Founders</a><div>Baltimore·Cofounder<span></span><span>·No Salary · 10.0% – 20.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to OVER Technology</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li><li><div>Management Jobs</div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/over-technology/jobs/190494-business-development-cfo' rel='nofollow'>Business Development/CFO</a><div>Baltimore·Full Time<span></span><span>·$90K – $120K · 10.0% – 15.0%</span></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><a rel='nofollow'><span></span>Applied</a></div></div><div></div><div><span>Apply</span><div><div></div><div></div><div><div><div><div>Add a message to OVER Technology</div>Apply<div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></li></ul></div></div></div><div><div><div><h3>OVER Technology Team</h3><div><div><div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/damarncarroll' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/damarncarroll' rel='nofollow'>Damarn Carroll</a><span>,</span></div><div>Founder <a href='https://angel.co/over-technology' title=&quot;OVER Technology&quot; rel='nofollow'><span>@</span><span>OVER Technology</span></a> • Worked at <a href='https://angel.co/home-point-financial' title=&quot;Home Point Financial&quot; rel='nofollow'><span>@</span><span>Home Point Financial</span></a> • </div></div></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/khalilah-carroll' rel='nofollow'></a></div><div><div><a href='https://angel.co/khalilah-carroll' rel='nofollow'>Khalilah Carroll</a></div></div></div></div></div></div><div></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div>OVER Technology  is one of 26,103 startups hiring on AngelList</div><div></div></div><div><div><span>Browse All Startup Jobs</span><a href='https://angel.co/recruiting/signup?src=job-showcase' rel='nofollow'>Post a Job</a></div></div><div><span>Help</span>·<span>Terms</span>·<span>Jobs by location</span><span>Problem?<span>Report this company</span></span></div></div></div></div></div><div></div>"
