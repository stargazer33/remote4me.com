Our speak up culture is strong.</li><li><strong>Remote first</strong>:&nbsp;Our team is fully distributed, and we work hard at that, but feel free to work from any of our offices in Paris, London, Brussels or Casablanca.</li><li><strong>The courage to fail</strong>:&nbsp;We celebrate the wins, but more importantly we're not afraid to fail, we always learn and go again.</li><li><strong>Team Unity</strong>: No one is left behind.</li><li><strong>Code quality</strong>:&nbsp;It's not software without tests.</li></ul><p><strong>What will be your role?</strong></p><p>We're hiring for talent, not location, that is why you will find members of our group based remotely throughout Europe. You'll join one of our cross-functional product team and will be its proud Android representative. There are plenty of challenges each of them are tackling at the moment such as:</p><ul><li>Driver team: create a scalable and reliable platform used by dozen of thousands of drivers on a daily basis</li><li>Payment team: make in-app payment management easy as pie for users.</li><li>Ride flow team: improve our ride flow by making it more modular while we are expanding in new countries with completely different approaches of using the product</li></ul><p>... and many others!</p><p><strong>Does it sound like you?</strong></p><ul><li>You have <strong>5 years of experience</strong> or more in Android development and you still like it.</li><li>Thanks to your advanced knowledge of <strong>Rx</strong>, you can write complete use cases with flatMaps, concats, zips and are not afraid to jump from one scheduler to another.</li><li>Though you could write a book about Java, you now only want to deal with data/sealed classes, extension functions and know the difference between apply/with/also/run/let.</li><li>You know enough about Fragments, Activities, savedInstanceStates &amp; Parcelables to know what you want to work with on your next project, and what you sincerely want to see burn.</li><li>You're in love with <strong>ConstraintLayout</strong>, can make art out of Canvas and build custom views when the framework is just not enough.</li><li>You know the difference between <strong>unit &amp; automated tests</strong>, can write Rx-oriented test cases without wanting to die and know how to get everything running on a<strong> CI platform</strong> while you sleep.</li><li>You know when to use API or implementation in your gradle files and are not afraid of multi-modules projects.</li><li>If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.</li><li>If you have experience with background services, unreliable network conditions &amp; location updates, we'd love it.</li><li>If you know what kills the phone's battery and how to help mitigate the issue, we'd enjoy knowing more about it too.</li></ul><p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p><ul><li>Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features. </li><li>Work in a release train cycle (we ship often ).</li><li>Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of Android drivers</li><li>Be a vital member of the broader Android team at Heetch and contribute to core architecture and design discussions.</li><li>Work closely with engineers from other product teams building cross-team features at scale.</li><li>Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues.</li><li>Share knowledge with everyone and help your team to grow.</li><li>Have the freedom to experiment. Intrigued by a new tech or library? Go for it! Let's see how it improves our services.</li><li>Routinely own and manage releases to the Play store.</li><li>Work on large cross-team projects.</li></ul><p><strong>What will be your main challenges?</strong></p><p>Our app is one, of the few mobile apps, running in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li><li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>What's next?</strong></p><p>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps:</p><ol><li>Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30)</li><li>Take home assignment (~5 days deadline)</li><li>Interview with your future teammates (1h)</li><li>Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders</li></ol><p></p><span>Apply now</span></div>",

Let's see how it improves our services.</li><li>Routinely own and manage releases to the Play store.</li><li>Work on large cross-team projects.</li></ul><p><strong>What will be your main challenges?</strong></p><p>Our app is one, of the few mobile apps, running in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li><li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>What's next?</strong></p><p>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps:</p><ol><li>Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30)</li><li>Take home assignment (~5 days deadline)</li><li>Interview with your future teammates (1h)</li><li>Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders</li></ol>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/heetch/031b3ac7-dae4-4c7b-bef6-760f6990e2ea?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=StackOverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Heetch</h3>            <div><p>Heetch is a mobility app with a simple mission: We want people to enjoy going out.<br>Every night and every day, our drivers are doing their best to make their rides unforgettable and friendly!

    "content": "<span><h2>Humbly Confident Senior Mobile Developer</h2></span> <br> <span><h3>You Need a Budget</h3></span> <div>  <div>   <br>About Us and Why We’re Hiring   <br>   <br>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;Google us, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.   <br>   <br>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.   <br>   <br>We have some big plans for our iOS (iPad, Apple Watch) and Android apps, and that’s where you might come in. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original Cultural Manifesto has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!   <br>   <br>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of professional software development experience, with at least 4 of those years spent writing iOS and/or Android apps. But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.   <br>   <br>Who you’d be working with:   <br>   <br>Our developer team is about 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.   <br>   <br>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.   <br>   <br>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.   <br>   <br>How You’ll Work at YNAB   <br>   <br>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:   <br>   <br>Live Where You Want   <br>   <br>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.   <br>   <br>No Crazy Hours   <br>   <br>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.   <br>   <br>Take Vacation (Seriously)   <br>   <br>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.   <br>   <br>The YNAB Retreat   <br>   <br>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on Laguna Beach. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.   <br>   <br>Up Your Game   <br>   <br>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.   <br>   <br>If You’re International...   <br>   <br>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.   <br>   <br>If You’re Stateside…   <br>   <br>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)   <br>   <br>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)   <br>   <br>Other Tidbits   <br>   <br>   <br>* Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)   <br>   <br>* The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.   <br>   <br>* We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.   <br>   <br>* We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.   <br>   <br>* We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.   <br>   <br>* Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. You will change lives.   <br>   <br>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…   <br>   <br>You're a software developer with over 5 years of professional, full time experience. At least four of those have been spent working with iOS or Android, or both. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.   <br>   <br>You'll help us maintain and implement new features in our mobile apps. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library that is currently based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across all of our platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help.   <br>   <br>Technologies we use on Android (current baseline is Marshmallow):   <br>   <br>   <br>* Kotlin for development   <br>   <br>* Moving towards an MVI architecture   <br>   <br>* Integrating with V8 JS engine   <br>   <br>* RxJava, Dagger, Robolectric   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>Technologies we use on iOS (current baseline is iOS 11):   <br>   <br>   <br>* Swift for any new development - we are slowly migrating the existing codebase over from Objective-C   <br>   <br>* Leveraging JavaScriptCore for our shared library integration   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.   <br>   <br>* Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.   <br>   <br>* Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.   <br>   <br>* Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* &quot;This part of the program is too slow. Can you find out why?&quot; &nbsp;   <br>   <br>* &quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?&quot;   <br>   <br>* “Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.   <br>   <br>* Have experience with either:   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* Kotlin and Java   <br>   <br>* Swift and Objective-C   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.   <br>   <br>* Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.   <br>   <br>* Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.   <br>   <br>* “Bonus points” awarded if you already use and love YNAB. :)   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.   <br>   <br>How to Apply   <br>   <br>   <br>* Apply below (here) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on June 30th, 2019. Firm. It’s a real deadline.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:   <br>   <br>* You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter.

(But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8' rel='nofollow'>reviews on the app store</a>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have some big plans for our iOS (iPad, Apple Watch) and Android apps, and that’s where you might come in. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> Cultural Manifesto</a> has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of professional software development experience, with at least 4 of those years spent writing iOS and/or Android apps. But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></strong></p><p>Our developer team is about 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.</p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s <em>external</em> competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.</p><p><strong><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></strong></p><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></strong></p><p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'> Costa Rica</a>, a <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'>Laguna Beach</a>. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong><strong>Up Your Game</strong></strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re International...</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p><p><strong><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></strong></p><p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em> <em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. <em>You will change lives. </em></p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…</strong></p><p>You're a software developer with over 5 years of professional, full time experience. At least four of those have been spent working with iOS or Android, or both. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.</p><p>You'll help us maintain and implement new features in our mobile apps. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library that is currently based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across all of our platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help.</p><p>Technologies we use on Android (current baseline is Marshmallow):</p><ul><li>Kotlin for development</li><li>Moving towards an MVI architecture</li><li>Integrating with V8 JS engine</li><li>RxJava, Dagger, Robolectric</li></ul><p>Technologies we use on iOS (current baseline is iOS 11):</p><ul><li>Swift for any new development - we are slowly migrating the existing codebase over from Objective-C</li><li>Leveraging JavaScriptCore for our shared library integration</li></ul><p><strong><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:</li><ul><li>&quot;This part of the program is too slow. Can you find out why?&quot; &nbsp;</li><li>&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?&quot;</li><li>“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”</li></ul><li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li><li>Have experience with either:</li><ul><li>Kotlin and Java</li><li>Swift and Objective-C</li></ul><li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Are a <em>senior</em> developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li><li>“Bonus points” awarded if you already use and love YNAB. :)</li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for <em>all</em> employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p><p><strong><strong>How to Apply</strong></strong></p><ul><li>Apply below (<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9oz' rel='nofollow'>here</a>) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on <strong>June 30th, 2019</strong><strong>.</strong> Firm.

(But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. Google us, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p><p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p><p>We have some big plans for our iOS (iPad, Apple Watch) and Android apps, and that’s where you might come in. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original Cultural Manifesto has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p><p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of professional software development experience, with at least 4 of those years spent writing iOS and/or Android apps. But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p><p>Our developer team is about 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you’ll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.</p><p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s <em>external</em> competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p><p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p><p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p><p><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></p><p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p><p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p><p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p><p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></p><p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p><p><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></p><p><strong>We get the teams together once a year</strong> to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on Laguna Beach. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p><p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p><p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new….We love to see our people grow.</p><p><strong>If You’re International…</strong></p><p><strong>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</strong></p><p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></p><p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p><p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em> <em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p><p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p><ul><li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li><li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li><li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li><li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li><li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li><li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li></ul><p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. <em>You will change lives.</em></p><p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…</strong></p><p>You’re a software developer with over 5 years of professional, full time experience. At least four of those have been spent working with iOS or Android, or both. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.</p><p>You’ll help us maintain and implement new features in our mobile apps. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library that is currently based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across all of our platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don’t have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Marshmallow on Android and iOS 10 on iOS. You’ll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you’ll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app.</p><p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p><ul><li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li><li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li><li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li><li>Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:<ul><li>“This part of the program is too slow. Can you find out why?”</li><li>“This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?”</li><li>“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”</li></ul></li><li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li><li>Have experience with either:<ul><li>Kotlin and Java</li><li>Swift and Objective-C</li></ul></li><li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.</li><li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li><li>Are a <em>senior</em> developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li><li>“Bonus points” awarded if you already use and love YNAB. </li></ul><p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for <em>all</em> employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9oz' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives.  [Google us](https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab), or [read some of our reviews on the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8), and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. We have some big plans for our iOS (iPad, Apple Watch) and Android apps, and that’s where you might come in. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original [Cultural Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit) has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of professional software development experience, with at least 4 of those years spent writing iOS and/or Android apps. But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. **Who you’d be working with:**Our developer team is about 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. **How You’ll Work at YNAB**We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:**Live Where You Want**We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.**No Crazy Hours**We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.**Take Vacation (Seriously)**We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.**The YNAB Retreat**We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done [Costa Rica](https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343), [a gigantic cabin](https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/) in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on [Laguna Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be). We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.**Up Your Game**We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.**If You’re International...**You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. **If You’re Stateside…**You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)**Other Tidbits**- Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) - The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. - We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.- We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.- We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.- Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money.  You will change lives. **Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…**You're a software developer with over 5 years of professional, full time experience. At least four of those have been spent working with iOS or Android, or both. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap. You'll help us maintain and implement new features in our mobile apps. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library that is currently based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across all of our platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Marshmallow on Android and iOS 10 on iOS. You'll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you'll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app. **You’re the one we’re looking for if you:**- Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.- Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.- Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.- Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:- &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This part of the program is too slow. Can you find out why?&quot;  - &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?&quot;- &gt;&gt;&gt;“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”- Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.- Have experience with either:- &gt;&gt;&gt;Kotlin and Java- &gt;&gt;&gt;Swift and Objective-C- Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.- Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.- Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.- “Bonus points” awarded if you already use and love YNAB. :)YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.**How to Apply**- Apply [here](https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9oz) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on **June 30th, 2019**. Firm. It’s a real deadline.- First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:- You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:- &gt;&gt;&gt;Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and **why you would be a great fit for the position**. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).- &gt;&gt;&gt;Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)- &gt;&gt;&gt;Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.- Includes answers to the following questions:- &gt;&gt;&gt;What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them? - &gt;&gt;&gt;Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.- &gt;&gt;&gt;If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?- Complete this short coding test [(https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb)](https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.We look forward to hearing from you!P.S.  If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!",

    "content": "<h2> Humbly Confident Senior Mobile Developer </h2><div><div><span><h2><span>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</span></h2></span></div><div><span>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. </span><a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a><span>, or read some of our </span><a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8' rel='nofollow'><span>reviews on the app store</span></a><span>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We have some big plans for our iOS (iPad, Apple Watch) and Android apps, and that’s where you might come in. </span><span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original</span><a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'><span></span><span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a><span> has to really </span><em>click</em><span> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of professional software development experience, with at least 4 of those years spent writing iOS and/or Android apps. But </span><span>first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h2>Who you'd be working with:</h2></div><div><span>Our developer team is about 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s </span><em>external</em><span> competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h2>How You'll Work at YNAB</h2></div><div><span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Live Where You Want</span></h4></div><div><span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h4></div><div><span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h4></div><div><span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span><em>minimum</em><span> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>The YNAB Retreat</span></h4></div><div><span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span><a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a><span>, a </span><a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a><span> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on </span><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'><span>Laguna Beach</span></a><span>. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Up Your Game</span></h4></div><div><span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>If You’re International...</span></h4></div><div><span>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h4></div><div><span>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span><em>and your family.</em><span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</span></div><div><br></div><div><span>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span><em>your retirement</em><span></span><em>nest egg</em><span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>Other Tidbits</span></h4></div><ul><li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span><br></li><li><span>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span><br></li><li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span><br></li><li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span><br></li><li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span><br></li><li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</span><br><br></li></ul><div><span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. </span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>You will change lives. </em></div><div><br></div><div><h2><span>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…</span></h2></div><div><span>You're a software developer with over 5 years of professional, full time experience. At least four of those have been spent working with iOS or Android, or both. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap. </span></div><div><br></div><div><span>You'll help us maintain and implement new features in our mobile apps. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library that is currently based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across all of our platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Marshmallow on Android and iOS 10 on iOS. You'll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you'll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app. </span></div><div><br></div><div><h4><span>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</span></h4></div><ul><li><span>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</span><br></li><li><span>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</span><br></li><li><span>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</span><br></li><li><span>Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:</span></li><li>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This part of the program is too slow. Can you find out why?&quot;</li><li>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?&quot;<br></li><li>&gt;&gt;&gt;“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”</li><li><span>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</span></li></ul><ul><li>Have experience with either:</li></ul><div><li>&gt;&gt;&gt;Kotlin and Java<br></li></div><div></div><div></div><div><li>&gt;&gt;&gt;Swift and Objective-C<br></li></div><div></div><div></div><ul><li><span>Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.</span></li><li><span>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</span></li><li><span>Are a </span><em>senior</em><span> developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</span></li></ul><ul><li>“Bonus points” awarded if you already use and love YNAB. :)</li></ul><div><br></div><div><span>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for </span><em>all</em><span> employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</span></div><div><br></div><div><h2><span>How to Apply</span></h2></div><ul><li><span>Apply here (<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9oz' rel='nofollow'>https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9oz</a>) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on </span><span><b>June 30th, 2019</b></span><span>.</span><span> Firm.

Either way, you’ll have built or contributed to a few different projects and can demonstrate that.<br /><br />You’ll be working on:<br /><br />- Our iOS app, written in Swift<br />- Our backend platform, written in .NET Framework 4.5 with a SQL Server database (we’d like to update this to .NET Core 2.2).<br />- Our event door app, written in JavaScript and the Electron framework<br />- Developing or delivering our new Android app, written in whatever you’d like; Java, Kotlin, React Native, it’s your choice!<br />- Developing the analytical tools to understand ticket buyer behaviour in detail.<br />- Expanding and developing app features including geolocational security and last minute activation of tickets.<br /><br />We hope that you will:<br /><br />- Have experience with at least some of the technologies we’ve mentioned above (iOS Development with Swift, .NET & ASP.NET, JavaScript, Android Development, and Azure).<br />- Have some public evidence of what you know. Do you have a stackoverflow profile? A hacker news profile? Do <br />you tweet? Write about technical things on Medium? Contribute to open source in any way?<br />- At least 3 years of professional experience<br />- Live somewhere in the UK and can make it to Birmingham occasionally.<br />- Have lots of ideas and a willingness to share them!<br />- We’re a startup so things can be chaotic. As well as being able to write good, clean code you’ll need to be able to solve problems on a daily basis using your own initiative. Flexibility and resilience are key!<br /><br />If you’re smart, friendly and love building software—we want to hear from you.<br /><br />Us<br /><br />We’ve boot-strapped the beta version with the help of contractors – so we’re in the scrappy early stages. As we're pre-revenue the budget is limited. <br /><br />But the beta is ready and the business plan is written.

You want to make sure people can know what's going on with their money   <br>   <br>Our team's values   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* Transparency: We discuss everything openly within the team.

This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>* Network and GPS management: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.   <br>   <br>* UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.   <br>   <br>* One way data flow and functional pattern: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers.

We’re fortunate to be backed by the top VCs in Europe, including&nbsp;Index Ventures,&nbsp;Creandum&nbsp;and&nbsp;firstminute capital.   <br>   <br>The Senior Android Developer role   <br>   <br>You'll drive the development of our native Android app. This is critical to Argent’s future as Android is the dominant platform in emerging markets, where there are some of the most urgent use cases for crypto. You’ll therefore be solving problems at scale for people around the world.   <br>   <br>This means we’re looking for a highly skilled Android developer who can push mobile technologies to their limits.   <br>   <br>Your code will be efficient, maintainable, reusable and well-tested. You’ll define and build state-of-the-art application architecture. And you’ll implement custom native user interfaces using the latest Android programming techniques.   <br>   <br>In the role you’ll work closely with world class engineers and product designers who aim to build an unrivalled product. You’ll not only contribute technical ideas but will help shape their overall direction.   <br>   <br>Requirements are:   <br>   <br>   <br>* 3+ years experience delivering quality, at scale consumer-facing Android apps available in the Play Store   <br>   <br>* Fluency with Java and RxJava; knowledge of Kotlin is a plus   <br>   <br>* Interest in blockchain and the Ethereum ecosystem   <br>   <br>* Strong object-oriented programming, and a good knowledge of pattern and anti-pattern design   <br>   <br>* Experience with app profiling, code versioning, deployment and continuous integration   <br>   <br>* Strong communication skills and an ability to work with both engineers and other roles   <br>   <br>* Fluency in written and spoken english   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>How we work   <br>   <br>We work remotely, transparently and balance Argent with the rest of our lives. We’ve all got loved ones with unpredictable schedules, be they kids or cats.   <br>   <br>Although we’re a distributed team you'll need to be based in the UK or Europe. This is because we find communication much easier when we’re in similar time zones and a short flight away. Within Europe you can choose to work wherever you like!   <br>   <br>We get together for a week every quarter so we can collaborate in person, explore new solutions, and have fun. So far we’ve played pétanque in Nice, bonded in Brussels and (tried to) surf in Lisbon.   <br>   <br>Equal opportunities   <br>   <br>At the heart of what we do is making crypto accessible to everyone. We want the team itself to reflect that diversity so we’d strongly encourage applications from underrepresented demographics.   <br>   <br>Please apply on&nbsp;https://www.argent.xyz/careers   <br>   <br>No agencies please   <br>   <br>#Location   <br>- EU-only   <br>  </div> </div>",

We want to make that accessible to everyone.</p><p>To do this, we’ve built a&nbsp;<a href='https://www.argent.xyz/' rel='nofollow'>crypto wallet</a>&nbsp;with the simplicity and security of the best new banking apps - without the bank. We hope it solves some of crypto’s biggest problems: there are no seed phrases, transaction fees or cryptic addresses. And it protects you from theft.</p><p>As a team, we have experience scaling mobile apps to tens of millions of users. Our eclectic backgrounds include PhDs in nuclear physics, quantum cryptography and decentralised cognitive networks. We’re fortunate to be backed by the top VCs in Europe, including&nbsp;<a href='https://www.indexventures.com/' rel='nofollow'>Index Ventures</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://www.creandum.com/' rel='nofollow'>Creandum</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.firstminute.capital/' rel='nofollow'>firstminute capital</a>.</p><p><strong>The Senior Android Developer role</strong></p><p>You'll drive the development of our native Android app. This is critical to Argent’s future as Android is the dominant platform in emerging markets, where there are some of the most urgent use cases for crypto. You’ll therefore be solving problems at scale for people around the world.</p><p>This means we’re looking for a highly skilled Android developer who can push mobile technologies to their limits.</p><p>Your code will be efficient, maintainable, reusable and well-tested. You’ll define and build state-of-the-art application architecture. And you’ll implement custom native user interfaces using the latest Android programming techniques.</p><p>In the role you’ll work closely with world class engineers and product designers who aim to build an unrivalled product. You’ll not only contribute technical ideas but will help shape their overall direction.</p><p><strong>Requirements are:</strong></p><ul><li>3+ years experience delivering quality, at scale consumer-facing Android apps available in the Play Store</li><li>Fluency with Java and RxJava; knowledge of Kotlin is a plus</li><li>Interest in blockchain and the Ethereum ecosystem</li><li>Strong object-oriented programming, and a good knowledge of pattern and anti-pattern design</li><li>Experience with app profiling, code versioning, deployment and continuous integration</li><li>Strong communication skills and an ability to work with both engineers and other roles</li><li>Fluency in written and spoken english</li></ul><p><strong>How we work</strong></p><p>We work remotely, transparently and balance Argent with the rest of our lives. We’ve all got loved ones with unpredictable schedules, be they kids or cats.</p><p>Although we’re a distributed team you'll need to be based in the UK or Europe. This is because we find communication much easier when we’re in similar time zones and a short flight away. Within Europe you can choose to work wherever you like!</p><p>We get together for a week every quarter so we can collaborate in person, explore new solutions, and have fun. So far we’ve played pétanque in Nice, bonded in Brussels and (tried to) surf in Lisbon.</p><p><strong>Equal opportunities</strong></p><p>At the heart of what we do is making crypto accessible to everyone. We want the team itself to reflect that diversity so we’d strongly encourage applications from underrepresented demographics.</p><p><strong><em>Please apply on&nbsp;<a href='https://www.argent.xyz/careers/' rel='nofollow'>https://www.argent.xyz/careers</a></em></strong></p><p><strong><em>No agencies please</em></strong></p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://argent.breezy.hr/p/0c4dc62073ef01-senior-android-developer-remote-europe-only?source=stackoverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Argent</h3>            <div><p><strong>Who we are ?</strong></p><p>Argent is lead by experienced entrepreneurs and funded by some of the best VCs in London.

Here is the portrait of a&nbsp;person we’re looking for.</em></p><p>You agree that JavaScript&nbsp;has&nbsp;won the war, at least for now. It’s your favorite tool, and you mastered it while making apps and web servers for years.&nbsp;You are an expert in <a href='http://node.js/' rel='nofollow'>node.js</a>. You know it’s architecture, and you don’t hesitate to use a profiler to improve the performance of a service. You’re following best development practices. Your code is nice and clean, and you can be on the same page with your teammates about this. You passed through times of manual deployments and now enjoy the era of Docker containers. However, you prefer to be serverless. Although you can spin up any services and self-manage them, you're more happy&nbsp;with using managed cloud solutions. You love Firebase. You can tell us at least a couple of stories how did it help you to solve a business problem in hours instead of days and weeks. You’re not trying to dump QA responsibility on someone else. You agree that testing is a developer’s responsibility. You&nbsp;are proud of your typical above 95% test coverage. You can organize CI/CD flow and push a constant stream of features and patches to a staging environment, then to the production.&nbsp; We are all constantly learning, but that’s not your first reason for joining us.&nbsp;You come here, first and foremost,&nbsp;to add another solid mark in your track record of successful projects. You&nbsp;listen to business needs and can evaluate priorities.&nbsp;You don’t want to be micromanaged.&nbsp;You are feature and delivery oriented. You&nbsp;are&nbsp;keen to make a great product.

You have an excellent opportunity to jump on-board and&nbsp;join us on this exciting journey. Here is the portrait of a&nbsp;person we’re looking for.</em></p><p>You agree that JavaScript&nbsp;has&nbsp;won the war, at least for now. It’s your favorite tool, and you mastered it while making apps and web servers for years. Your favorite front-end framework is <a href='http://react.js/' rel='nofollow'>React.js</a>. You can use it in different variations depending on a task and a project size. You are an expert in <a href='http://node.js/' rel='nofollow'>node.js</a>. You know it’s architecture, and you don’t hesitate to use a profiler to improve the performance of a service. You’re following best development practices. Your code is nice and clean, and you can be on the same page with your teammates about this. You passed through times of manual deployments and now enjoy the era of Docker containers. However, you prefer to be serverless. Although you can spin up any services and self-manage them, you're more happy&nbsp;with using managed cloud solutions. You love Firebase. You can tell us at least a couple of stories how did it help you to solve a business problem in hours instead of days and weeks. You’re not trying to dump QA responsibility on someone else. You agree that testing is a developer’s responsibility. You&nbsp;are proud of your typical above 95% test coverage. You can organize CI/CD flow and push a constant stream of features and patches to a staging environment, then to the production.&nbsp; We are all constantly learning, but that’s not your first reason for joining us.&nbsp;You come here, first and foremost,&nbsp;to add another solid mark in your track record of successful projects. You&nbsp;listen to business needs and can evaluate priorities.&nbsp;You don’t want to be micromanaged.&nbsp;You are feature and delivery oriented. You&nbsp;are&nbsp;keen to make a great product.

You want to make sure people can know what's going on with their money <strong>Our team's values</strong><ul><li><strong>Transparency</strong>: We discuss everything openly within the team. Our speak up culture is strong.</li><li><strong>Remote first:</strong>&nbsp;Our team is fully distributed, and we work hard at that, but feel free to work from any of our offices in Paris, London, Brussels or Casablanca.</li><li><strong>The courage to fail:</strong>&nbsp;We celebrate the wins, but more importantly we're not afraid to fail, we always learn and go again.</li><li><strong>Team Unity</strong>: No one is left behind.</li><li><strong>Code quality:</strong>&nbsp;It's not software without tests.</li></ul><strong>Does it sound like you?</strong><ul><li>You have more than 5 years of experience in iOS development.</li><li>You also have at least 2 years of experience in using Reactive programming.</li><li>You've already worked with Swift in Production.</li><li>You understand the iOS SDK and application lifecycle.</li><li>You've got knowledge in common architectural patterns.</li><li>You're skilled in UI using ConstraintLayout.</li><li>You're thorough when it comes to test coverage and other best practices.</li><li>If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.</li><li>If you know about managing the lifecycle of background services and their impact on battery usage, it would also be a bonus.</li></ul><strong>What will you do?</strong><ul><li>Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features </li><li>Work in a release train cycle (we ship often )</li><li>Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of Android drivers</li><li>Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues</li><li>Have the freedom to experiment.

This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.<ul><li>Network and GPS management: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li><li>UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design.

This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li><li>UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li><li>One way data flow and functional pattern: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from.</li></ul><p><strong>What's next?</strong></p><p>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps:</p><ol><li>Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30)</li><li>Take home assignment (~5 days deadline)</li><li>Interview with your future teammates (1h)</li><li>Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders</li></ol>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://jobs.lever.co/heetch/808d2619-097d-4497-9ada-ec1ae33dfb35?lever-origin=applied&amp;lever-source%5B%5D=StackOverflow' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h3>About Heetch</h3>            <div><p>Heetch is a mobility app with a simple mission: We want people to enjoy going out.<br>Every night and every day, our drivers are doing their best to make their rides unforgettable and friendly!
