The work spans a broad range, from engineering and coding features, to polishing world-class user interfaces.</p><p>*Constantly improve the quality of our products by fixing bugs and refactoring the code base where necessary, as well as adding that WOW factor to put a smile on our users’ faces.</p><p>*Stay up to speed with new technologies (particularly on Android), and test the promising ones to make sure we don’t miss out on game-changing opportunities.</p><p>What We Offer</p><p>*Huge impact. You’ll be working on apps used by millions of people all around the world. The quality of your work will make a decisive difference—both to the users and to Bending Spoons as a whole.</p><p>*Talented, knowledgeable colleagues.

We strive to use the best, most modern tools and technologies, and when they fall short of our expectations we invent our own. It’s a geek’s paradise.</p><p>*Own products.

You’re massively into getting results, and always aim for excellence in what you do.</p><p>*Curiosity and initiative.

You seek—you don’t just wait to be told what to do.</p><p>*A knack for UX and attention to detail. You care about developing quality user experiences, and notice the details that make a difference. You get a kick out of making a UI or an animation just perfect.</p><p>*Diligence, organization. You can be entrusted with responsibilities big and small.</p><p>*Humility. You’re down to earth, eager to listen to feedback and constructive criticism, and ready to get your hands dirty with whatever the team needs to succeed.</p><p>*Proficient in English. You read, write, and speak fluently in English.</p><p>*Availability. We work 9-6 GMT+1. Our schedule is flexible, but we prefer to work together most of the time. That’s why you should live somewhere with a similar timezone—between GMT-2 and GMT+3.</p><p>Commitment &amp; Contract: Full-time, permanent (tempo indeterminato).</p><p>Location: Our HQ is in downtown Milan, but you'll be working from the comfort of your home.</p><p>Compensation &amp; Benefits: Generous, top of market, and moreover can grow very rapidly and include stock options, depending on performance. You’ll receive the latest Mac, iPhone, and wireless noise-canceling Bose headset, as well as any software you might need to perform at your best.</p><p>IMPORTANT</p><p>Please notice that only applications submitted through our website will be considered.

We&rsquo;re less bothered about seniority. We're open to a diversity of experience: you may be fresh out of university or a senior lead, we'd love to hear from you and see how we could work together.</p><br /><p><strong>What&rsquo;s Byrde?</strong></p><br /><p>We're building a product that&rsquo;s re-imagining how runners run. We're made by runners for runners and will improve the running experience for the 200 million runners globally. From experience design to AI we're making running more accessible and helping runners build a healthy lasting habit. The core of the product is an adaptive training plan that moves and updates as a runner progresses. The plan improves a runner&rsquo;s health and well-being one run at a time.</p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re in the process of finishing the beta version of the product that we&rsquo;ll be testing with runners through the UK ahead of the first public release in October 2020.</p><br /><p><strong>What you&rsquo;ll be working on</strong></p><br /><p>You&rsquo;ll be defining, and building, the back-end architecture of the project. You&rsquo;ll be working collaboratively with other members of the team to define our content model, public and private API integrations, and platform architecture. It&rsquo;s early days for the product so you&rsquo;re likely to cover the full-stack on some features.</p><br /><p><strong>Who you are</strong></p><br /><p>Ideally you&rsquo;ll have the following, or adjacent, experience:</p><br /><ul><br /><li>Experience working with Firebase, Cloud SQL, Cloud Run / App Engine</li><br /><li>Experience of Flutter, Java and/ or Swift</li><br /><li>Experience of consuming, creating and maintaining REST APIs</li><br /><li>Experience of using services such as Actions on Google to generate conversational experiences with users</li><br /><li>Experience refactoring code and hunting for inefficiencies/ bottlenecks</li><br /><li>Willingness to learn new skills, make things better and find the best tools</li><br /><li>Ability to work with uncertainty and lots of change</li><br /><li>Ability to make pragmatic, quick decisions and a recognition that 'done&rsquo; is often better than &lsquo;perfect&rsquo;</li><br /><li>Interest in design, design thinking and how it interacts with development</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Who we are</strong></p><br /><p>We&rsquo;re currently a small team of three. Between us we&rsquo;ve experience of designing, developing and delivering work for Google, Dyson and Groupon amongst others. We&rsquo;re passionate about running and making the sport more accessible. We&rsquo;re also passionate about building an amazing work culture with a focus on allowing the time and space for everyone to do their best work.</p><br /><p><strong>Work for humans</strong></p><br /><p>Just as Byrde adapts to a runner we believe work needs to do the same. We have core hours when all meetings and standups happen. From there it's up to you when you feel you work best, or when it works best for you around the rest of your life. We use fairly standard tools: G Suite, Github and Slack are our core</p><br /><p><strong>Bristol or remote</strong></p><br /><p>From the start we&rsquo;ve been a remote-first company. If you&rsquo;re Bristol based, or interested in coming to Bristol: awesome! It&rsquo;s a running paradise here. From the flat, fast paths of the floating harbour through to the inner city trails taking you to the Somerset countryside. But if you&rsquo;ve got better trail-heads where you&rsquo;re already based that&rsquo;s awesome too.

Byrde is committed to equal opportunity for our roles and would strongly encourage anyone to apply for this role if it is of interest (even if you feel you might not necessarily have exactly the matching skills). All applicants will be treated in the same way regardless of gender, race, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, colour, age, disability or any other issue of diversity.</p>",

    "content": "<p><strong>Who are Opensignal?</strong></p><br /><p>Opensignal, a mobile analytics company, is the global standard for measuring real-world mobile network experience. Using billions of measurements collected 24/7 from tens of millions of smartphones, we analyze real-world mobile network experience at the largest scale and frequency in the wireless industry. We believe measuring how the network performs directly through users&rsquo; eyes is key to building better wireless networks. Our insights are used across the industry by mobile operators, telecoms regulators, equipment manufacturers and analysts. We have done business across six continents and have driven press headlines in 80 countries, in an industry impacting the lives of billions around the world.</p><br /><p>Founded in 2010, Opensignal is a high-growth global company harnessing the power of mobile technologies and big data analytics to redefine how the mobile industry measures network performance. We&rsquo;re part of the<a href='https://www.globaltelecomsbusiness.com/article/b14xj0qzzyc34x/gtb-announces-power100-for-2017'> </a><u>Global Telecoms &lsquo;Power 100&rsquo;</u>, <a href='https://technation.io/news/26-late-stage-uk-tech-companies-join-future-fifty-6/'>TechCity Future Fifty</a>, and backed by an impressive portfolio of investors.</p><br /><p>We're headquartered in London, UK, where you&rsquo;ll find most of our employees, who we like to call 'Opensignalers', but the teams you'll work with are global. A truly international team, our &lsquo;Opensignalers&rsquo; work across four continents, and represent over 25 nationalities.</p><br /><p>Find out more by visiting our <a href='https://www.opensignal.com/about/about-us'>website</a>.</p><br /><p><strong>Purpose of the role</strong></p><br /><p>Opensignal market insights or analytics solutions are powered by data coming from millions of devices, through connectivity tests performed on Android and iOS devices, in realistic conditions. To provide the most accurate insights, we need a large amount of data from both mobile platforms.</p><br /><p>We are currently maintaining two iOS applications: <a href='https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/opensignal-speed-test-maps/id598298030'>OpenSignal</a>, providing technical network information to users, live average speed, video streaming quality, or coverage maps. And <a href='https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/meteor-3g-4g-5g-speed-test/id1292709222'>Meteor</a>, where speed tests results are translated into real life experience ratings for popular apps, aimed at a less technical audience. Both of these apps are powered by our network testing SDK, that we continuously improve to provide as rich a dataset to our analysts as possible.</p><br /><p>Over the coming months, we have an exciting roadmap of new features we are looking to build into both apps, with the aim of providing more information to our users, as well as grow our sample size and produce better reports. To deliver this roadmap, we need help &ndash; we need you!</p><br /><p>Our Engineering function is organised using a variation of the &ldquo;Spotify&rdquo; Squad Model: you will be joining our &ldquo;Data Acquisition Squad&rdquo;, a cross-functional team containing all the skills to deliver our goals from A to Z, and as a member of our &ldquo;Mobile Chapter&rdquo;, which groups all our mobile developers. The mission of the Data Acquisition Squad is to collect as much good quality connectivity information as possible from real life devices. We then pass it on to other Squads, whose data scientists and data engineers work together to provide compelling Metrics and Awards, as seen for example in this recent report covering <a href='https://www.opensignal.com/reports/2020/03/netherlands/mobile-network-experience'>the Netherlands</a>.</p><br /><p>Within the Data Acquisition Squad, you will be working alongside another iOS Engineer, 4 Android Engineers, a Data Scientist, a Data Engineer, a QA Engineer, and the Squad Lead, collaborating with wider colleagues from the Design, Product &amp; Programme Management teams, who support us on a daily basis. We are a multi-cultural team &ndash; with as many nationalities as we have team members! Most of the team is based in our London HQ, with a few members working remotely.</p><br /><p>We organise our work following the Agile principles (mostly!): we run 2-week sprints, with daily stand-up, retrospectives, demos, and planning meetings. Tech wise, our code is on GitHub, and we use Jira for task management. Jenkins runs our CI.</p><br /><p><strong>As an iOS Engineer you will be responsible for</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Implementing new UI features in both of our apps, written mostly in Swift, with some older components still in written in Objective C. As an example, we recently added the ability to test video experience in our OpenSignal application. You could build our next connectivity test or bring this capability across to our Meteor app.</li><br /><li>Extend our network testing SDK to collect more accurate data, leveraging the latest APIs from the iOS platform. For example, we expect a new 5G iPhone to be released soon, we will need to optimize our connectivity tests for it!</li><br /><li>On top of this, the usual responsibilities of a Mobile Engineer will apply, such as:<br /><ul><br /><li>Managing technical debt, and repaying it, when the time is right</li><br /><li>Extending our automated testing capability</li><br /><li>Maintaining our continuous integration builds</li><br /><li>Review other team members pull requests</li><br /><li>Work closely with our Designer to guide mock-ups and early prototypes and provide informed advice based on iOS platform guidance and restrictions</li><br /></ul><br /></li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What we need from you</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>This is a mid-level iOS role; we&rsquo;d be looking for experience in at least one if not two previous roles as an iOS Developer, working on commercially available applications or SDKs. You&rsquo;ll have worked in either Swift or Objective-C, although both would be a big advantage.</li><br /><li>You have experience building UI components, and know how to handle data persistence, handle the application lifecycle events from the iOS platform, and how to build an app with a clean architecture.</li><br /><li>You will be familiar with the Agile methodology and best practices and ideally have experience working cross-functionally, collaborating with stakeholders outside of your immediate team,</li><br /><li>You'll have an excellent knowledge of coding principles - variables, loops, types etc. and be able to practically apply them to challenging problems. We strive for high quality in all of our deployed code. You&rsquo;ll have some experience working with TDD, SOLID principles and have a good understanding of what makes clean, readable code.</li><br /><li>This knowledge will extend to having used threads while working at least one previous role. You&rsquo;ll be comfortable with the ideas behind multi-threading and will be able to work on code that uses this paradigm, even if you&rsquo;ve never created an app that works this way from scratch.</li><br /><li>You'll have the attitude of a pragmatic problem solver, and an engineering mind-set. By this we mean an interest in all things tech, a desire to experiment and tinker (even with tools and technologies outside your immediate remit) and you'll find the challenges faced whilst programming to be interesting and satisfying.</li><br /><li>You should be able to work autonomously, and gel with the team. The role will involve a significant amount of code reviewing other&rsquo;s work, and you should have the ability to do this in a respectful and understanding way.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>Desirable:</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Some exposure to the Android ecosystem would be a plus, as you may at times need to read some Kotlin or Java code from our Android apps to port it over and adapt it to iOS.</li><br /><li>A strong understanding of network protocols and technologies (tcp, udp, network layers, http / https etc.) will be a definite advantage for all the work involving our iOS SDK.</li><br /><li>Knowledge about telecommunications technologies (LTE, 5G) and the telecoms industry in general will be also beneficial, but not critical.</li><br /></ul><br /><p><strong>What will you get in return?</strong></p><br /><ul><br /><li>Competitive salary and stock options to share our growth</li><br /><li>Matched-contribution based pension scheme, company-wide bonus, private healthcare (including wellbeing subscriptions and discounted gym membership), cycle to work scheme and MacBook of your choice</li><br /><li>Constant exposure to learning opportunities in your role and the ability to make an impact from day one</li><br /><li>&pound;1000 learning budget with access to a learning platform providing access to thousands of opportunities to spend it on &ndash; from conferences to courses and training, and regular 'Opensessions' (internal learning talks)</li><br /><li>Our 'Opensignalers' - an ambitious, focused and friendly team backed by some of Europe's top investors</li><br /><li>25 days holiday per year and generous flexible working culture</li><br /><li>Regular all-company events &ndash; from team lunches, to monthly HQ town halls and bi-annual away days)</li><br /><li>HQ in Angel, central London, filled with fresh fruit, coffee and an abundance of snacks and drinks, set in an area buzzing with coffee shops, eateries, a local market and bars.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>To understand how we will be holding your information please take a look at our&nbsp;<a href='https://workable.com/nr?l=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensignal.com%2Fsites%2Fopensignal-com%2Ffiles%2Frecruitment_privacy_policy.pdf'>Recruitment Privacy Notice</a>.</p>",

Whatever you choose, we'll always have a workstation for you at our HQ too.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Home cooked, Healthy, and Tasty Lunch Everyday</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Monthly Wellness Reimbursement</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible Work Schedules</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Conference &amp; Education Budget</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Collaborative, Fun Work Environment</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Whatever Hardware You Need</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Learn and Work Across the Entire Stack</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Offsites Galore!</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great Benefits</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Remote based wfh</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

We then open an app to find people’s curated photos of their lives. We tap another, for meditation.&nbsp; Another, to hail a rideshare.&nbsp; Another, for email. Then back to the news app. To Slack. Email. Skype. Whatsapp. Yelp. Maps. Everything. Anything. Except what we care about most intimately: friends and loved ones. What they’re up to that day. What they’re thinking about doing, seeing, experiencing. I care most about my social life. There’s no app for that—yet.</p><p>After creating a world of infinite connection online, the internet is now pushing us apart in our real lives, making us lonelier, more isolated. The world is becoming more unstable, while the simple act of kicking back and bullshitting with close friends is becoming more elusive. We need an app that gets us off our phones and out into the world. Closer to our friends, family, and loved ones.</p><p><strong>What<br></strong>The world’s first platform that truly connects us. The world’s first&nbsp;<em>Social Life</em>&nbsp;application.&nbsp;</p><p>Social life is simply: things to do, and people to do those things with.&nbsp;What’s needed is a platform that bridges the gap. An app that tackles the mundane, intimate, and basic human desire of interconnectedness. More importantly, a product that does not rely on turning users into a click farm. What’s needed is&nbsp;<strong>Go</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Go delivers timely, exciting, and desirable things to do by allowing you to opt-in&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;to receive information about&nbsp;<em>specific</em>&nbsp;types of activities that&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;care about! This creates a new paradigm: one in which people can safely broadcast their activities without spending social capital, because they know that all their friends have directly opted-in to receiving updates about activities of this type. There is no 'invitation' to accept or deny, no social capital to lose by sharing that you want to grab a coffee with whoever’s free this weekend.</p><p>Even without active friends, Go shows you what's out there: things that you care about, happening right now. It helps by showing possible activities that others have posted, or that the system generates based on your interests and location. Go helps you find all of the connections the world has to offer.</p><p>Go both&nbsp;<em>improves</em>&nbsp;the social contract with your friends and&nbsp;<em>expands</em>&nbsp;the limits of what your social life is by connecting you to the world in real life—not just the fantasy version on your screen.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Paid Health Premiums; 80% for Dependents, 80% for Dental &amp; Vision</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Unlimited Time Off</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>7 Holidays + Year-End Break</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>100% Paid Parental Leave</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Great Hardware</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",

Everyone's voice is heard, and we strongly believe that&nbsp;being part of an&nbsp;inclusive and&nbsp;diverse team that works closely together can produce amazing results.</p><p>The&nbsp;size of our team is small enough to allow everyone to be equally involved and have a clear view of the big picture. We won’t bore you with a single never-ending subtask of a subtask. Meetings and interruptions are always kept to a minimum. We want to you to do work that matters and work that you are proud of.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Who we're looking for</strong></p><p>We're looking&nbsp;for team members that are enjoy&nbsp;working on all the aspects of developing&nbsp;and evolving an iOS app.&nbsp;From the deep inner workings of the application’s backend architecture and scaling to polishing the animations of the UI and working with our support team to diagnose an issue that a user is having. We require at least 3 years of iOS development experience&nbsp;and you must be able to show at least one real-world project where you have made a significant contribution.</p><p>It's important to know that we're&nbsp;looking for a full-time exclusive collaboration that will last for years and evolve over time. Don't apply for this position if you are a freelance developer searching&nbsp;for a side&nbsp;project to work on for the next few months and move on to the next one.&nbsp;</p><p>Skills and expertise that we require:</p><ul><li>At least 3 years of iOS development experience using&nbsp;Swift and Objective-C&nbsp;</li><li>Experience working with UIKit, Core Animation, GCD, Core Data and WatchKit.</li><li>Experience working with Git version control and Unit testing.</li><li>Experience in performance profiling with Instruments on Xcode.</li><li>Comfortable working and communicating in English, both in writing and speaking.</li><li>Willingness to learn and experiment with new technologies.</li></ul><p><strong>A day at Neybox</strong></p><p>All team members start their day with a quick five-minute report of what they intend to do&nbsp;work on and what has been their progress so far to help us coordinate and prioritise. After that each member of the team will be working on their assigned tasks alone or in coordination with other members of the team developing new features, squashing bugs, prototyping, updating the UI or experimenting with new technologies or the next crazy idea that might change the world.</p><p>We practice Agile development and plan our work on a&nbsp;fifteen-day sprints so there will be regular meetings every second Monday, Thursday and Friday to start a new sprint, plan ahead and show the rest of the team what has be done. There are very few other meetings during the sprint because we have actual work to do ;) That's it!</p><p><strong>What we offer</strong></p><p>We offer a great salary, paid vacation time, financial support for opportunities that will help you grow as professional&nbsp;and&nbsp;we reward every team member with additional bonuses and benefits for outstanding work and personal or team goals achieved.</p><p>If that sounds like what you're looking for, just apply for the position and we'll reach to set up a meeting to get to know you better.</p>            </div>        <div>            <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/276716?reset=False&amp;ra=1uNIKvCk9BHa&amp;oqs=a%3D1uNIKvCk9BHa%26so_medium%3DTalent%26so_source%3DTalentApi' rel='nofollow'>                                <span>Easy apply</span>            </a>                            </div>",
