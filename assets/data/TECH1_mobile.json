With over 20 million enthusiastic customers in 195 countries, TeamSnap has quickly become one of the fastest-growing team and group management solutions on the planet.\\n\\nWe value trust, communication and fun more than big company policies and rules, and we thrive on empowering our employees instead of controlling them. We’ve been named to Outside Magazine’s list of Best Places to Work the last three years.\\n\\n**What You’ll Be Doing**\\nAs a strong Android developer (duh) you’ll generate creative ideas on how to harness the power of mobile apps to help players, coaches, group leaders and parents to interact with their sports teams and social groups.

We’re passionate about helping our customers spend less time organizing and more time playing.\\n\\n**Benefits and Perks**\\nWe offer competitive salary and benefits, lots of opportunity to develop professionally, and the ability to demonstrate what you can achieve. TeamSnap is still small enough that your actions will help drive our success. Benefits include:\\n* Competitive salary\\n* Equity\\n* Medical/dental/vision for you and your family\\n* Education reimbursement up to $1,500/yr\\n* Wellness stipend of $50/mo\\n* 401K\\n* Up to $300/yr to donate to charitable causes\\n* Free TeamSnap service for your family and friends\\n* Free TeamSnap swag\\n* Flexible PTO and vacation policy\\n\\n**Diversity and Inclusion**\\nTeamSnap is a company built around trust, kindness and collaboration, where diverse backgrounds, experiences and viewpoints are celebrated and valued.

Either way, you&rsquo;ll have built or contributed to a few different projects and can demonstrate that. You&rsquo;ll be working on:</p><br /><p>- Our backend platform, written in .NET Framework 4.5 with a SQL Server database (we&rsquo;d like to update this to .NET Core 2.2). -</p><br /><p>- Our iOS app, written in Swift (or managing contractors)</p><br /><p>- Our event door app, written in JavaScript and the Electron framework</p><br /><p>- Developing or delivering our new Android app, written in whatever you&rsquo;d like; Java, Kotlin, React Native, it&rsquo;s your choice! -</p><br /><p>- Developing the analytical tools to understand ticket buyer behaviour in detail.</p><br /><p>- Expanding and developing app features including geolocational security and last minute activation of tickets.</p><br /><p><strong>We hope that you will: </strong></p><br /><p>- Have experience with at least some of the technologies we&rsquo;ve mentioned above (iOS Development with Swift, .NET &amp; ASP.NET, JavaScript, Android Development, and Azure).</p><br /><p>- Have some public evidence of what you know. Do you have a stackoverflow profile? A hacker news profile? Do you tweet? Write about technical things on Medium? Contribute to open source in any way?</p><br /><p>- At least 3 years of professional experience</p><br /><p>- Live somewhere in the UK and can make it to Birmingham occasionally.</p><br /><p>- Have lots of ideas and a willingness to share them!</p><br /><p>- We&rsquo;re a startup so things can be chaotic. As well as being able to write good, clean code you&rsquo;ll need to be able to solve problems on a daily basis using your own initiative. Flexibility and resilience are key! If you&rsquo;re smart, friendly and love building software&mdash;we want to hear from you.</p><br /><p><strong>About us</strong></p><br /><p>We&rsquo;ve boot-strapped the beta version with the help of contractors &ndash; so we&rsquo;re in the scrappy early stages. As we're pre-revenue the budget is limited. But the beta is ready and the business plan is written. And you&rsquo;ll be working with a founder who has raised an A-round of &pound;300k for an earlier project. The role will initially be part-time or on a contract basis. We're raising a round, we'll make you full time and pay you a full-time salary when we do.</p><br /><p>As a key partner, you'll get a generous share option package from the start to reflect your time and commitment in the fundraising.&nbsp;</p><br /><p><strong>Where you&rsquo;ll work </strong></p><br /><p>Although we&rsquo;re based in Birmingham and will need to see you in person from time to time, you can work remotely the rest of the time.</p>",

Instead of smart contracts we created building blocks, making applications, tokens and coins as easy to deploy as possible. It’s fast, it works and our test net is already live.</span></p><p><span>Radix has built up a global following 43,000 interested community members, companies and developers from around the world. As well as raising money from some of the top European VCs and Funds.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>What problems are we solving?</strong></p><p><span>Currently, money is hyper-local, it exists in small pools in each country with specialised service and tech providers specific to the jurisdiction. Radix changes that. </span><span>We believe</span> <span>businesses should create money without borders. Our ledger provides API toolkits to developers that includes the regulatory wrappers, removing much of the need for developers and companies to worry about regulatory compliance, client money rules and jurisdictional red tape. </span><strong><em>We can do that because Radix is a next-generation decentralised ledger technology.</em></strong></p><p><strong>We believe this is what technology should look like and we are looking for talent to help us deliver on our promise.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Learn more about us&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>Radix Technology: </span><a href='https://youtu.be/dnOO2nItiss' rel='nofollow'><span>https://youtu.be/dnOO2nItiss</span></a></p><p><span>Radix Mission: </span><a href='https://youtu.be/Hw90aMyvLbM' rel='nofollow'><span>https://youtu.be/Hw90aMyvLb</span></a></p><p><strong>About the Role:</strong></p><p>As a Middleware Developer you will design, develop, release and maintain application libraries across various technologies and languages.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior experience with startups and working with agile, cross-functional teams is a necessity.

You'll join one of our cross-functional product team and will be its proud iOS representative.</p><p>There are plenty of challenges each of them are tackling at the moment such as:</p><ul><li>Driver: create a scalable and reliable platform used by dozen of thousands of drivers on a daily basis</li><li>Payment: make in-app payment management easy as pie for users.</li><li>Ride flow: improve our ride flow by making it more modular while we are expanding in new countries with completely different approaches of using the product</li></ul><p>... and many others!</p><p><strong>Does it sound like you?</strong></p><ul><li>You have more than 5 years of experience in iOS development.</li><li>You also have at least 2 years of experience in using Reactive programming.</li><li>You've already worked with Swift in Production.</li><li>You understand the iOS SDK and application lifecycle.</li><li>You've got knowledge in common architectural patterns.</li><li>You're skilled in UI using AutoLayout.</li><li>You're thorough when it comes to test coverage and other best practices.</li></ul><p><strong>Bonus points ;)</strong></p><ul><li>If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus.</li><li>If you know about managing the lifecycle of background services and their impact on battery usage, it would also be a bonus.</li></ul><p><strong>What will you do?</strong></p><ul><li>Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features. </li><li>Work in a release train cycle (we ship often ).</li><li>Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of iOS drivers</li><li>Be a vital member of the broader iOS team at Heetch and contribute to core architecture and design discussions.</li><li>Work closely with engineers from other product teams building cross-team features at scale.</li><li>Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues.</li><li>Share knowledge with everyone and help your team to grow.</li><li>Have the freedom to experiment.

This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app.</p><ul><li><strong>Network and GPS management</strong>: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking.</li><li><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience.</li><li><strong>One way data flow and functional pattern</strong>: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers.

We extensively use Video and WebRTC technologies: some experience in that is good, but we also have in-house devs in this area to guide you.</p><p>Our Android app works, but our current developer has shifted priorities, hence we want to recruit.</p><p>We offer competitive salaries, stock options, a 401(k) with a 4% match, health insurance that is 100% covered by us, and 30 days of vacation per year which we expect you to use.</p><p>We have a small but highly competent team of engineers and a hands-off management culture. And we love building tech.</p><p><strong>The position will be based remote in Europe or North America.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://lookback.io/jobs/android-developer-2019/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

You’ll need a solid understanding of security threats and how to overcome them.\\n\\n* Previous experience in data is a plus, but most importantly you’re enthusiastic about data and how it can empower our customers to make good decisions.\\n\\n* You don’t wait to be told what to do.

We are looking for a full-time Android developer to improve our existing Android app and work on a build automation project.</p><p>Learn about who we are, what we’re looking for, and how you can grow with us!</p><p><strong>REQUIRED EXPERIENCE</strong></p><ul><li>A solid communicator.&nbsp;<strong>We are 100% remote</strong>&nbsp;and communication means everything.</li><li>Experienced in Java and Kotlin. Our codebase is mainly in Kotlin.</li><li>Care about good software architecture, testing, and automation. Our test coverage needs to be significantly improved.</li><li>Fair understanding of RxJava and Kotlin Coroutines. While we do not require high-level knowledge of RxJava, it is used in the current codebase.</li><li>At least basic knowledge of basic Material Design principles.</li><li>Interest in learning more about user behavior through use of analytics.</li><li>3+ years experience in Android software development.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT WE DO</strong></p><p>Events are where we go to be inspired by those who’ve followed their dreams, learn from successful people, build life-long friendships, and discover new opportunities.</p><p>Our mission at Sched is to empower teams to organize life-changing events. Thousands of events depend on Sched, like tech conferences, comic conventions, music festivals, yoga festivals, professional development days, and even furry conventions. Seriously, there is an event for everything.</p><p>You’ll be building something that makes a real difference to our customers. Here’s actual feedback about what you’ll be building:</p><ul><li>I wonder what the world did before Sched…</li><li>Sched completely revolutionized our convention.</li><li>Using Sched is something I actively LOOK FORWARD TO whenever we’re getting ready to put on another event.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL DO</strong></p><p>You will be the only Android engineer when you start. While you will take the lead in making most of the engineering decisions, collaboration remains a big part of your day-to-day. You will find yourself, for example, spending significant time communicating with your iOS counterpart to maintain a compatible feature set, with our support team to resolve with issues, and with the entire team on product roadmap discussions.</p><p>We keep track of progress through a loose kanban/loose agile project management approach. Each engineer is responsible for breaking down the tasks of their current project(s), laying out what they plan to implement in the cycle to-do list, and moving the task to “in-flight” when they are actively working on it.</p><p><strong>Your first two challenges in this position are to:</strong></p><ul><li>Stabilize and improve critical functionality in the existing android app.</li><li>Implement an automated build system for the Android app using iOS implementation as a rough reference.</li></ul><p><strong>PAY &amp; BENEFITS</strong></p><p>Salary is dependent on experience. Sched offers a broad suite of benefits to its employees including company-sponsored health, dental, vision, life, disability, and accidental dismemberment insurance. We offer retirement plans including a 401K and matching program. Other benefits include discretionary annual bonuses, education expenses, Paid Time Off, and other incentive programs.</p><p><strong>We are 100% remote! We get together throughout the year in incredible places like Morocco, Cambodia, and Medellín, all covered by Sched. Part work, part vacation, we call them #schedcations.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://sched.com/careers/android-engineer/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

This job is a great fit for pragmatic programmers with a functional bend.</p><p>Over the last few years, we’ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects, built full stack solutions leveraging Elixir and Phoenix, constructed models and data pipelines with Python and delighted our users utilizing in React, Native iOS and Android.</p><p>We do a lot.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p><p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions.</p><p>At Very, there is a never-ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year, we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p><p>You’ll spend the bulk your week (35 hours) designing and developing on a product or platform for one of our clients. The remainder can be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and/or participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p><p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p><p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools/platforms:</p><p><strong>Our Current Tooling</strong></p><ul><li>React &amp; React Native</li><li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li><li>Java &amp; Kotlin</li><li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Python</li><li>Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</li><li>Serverless</li><li>AWS</li></ul><p>You don’t need to be an expert in these tools, but familiarity is a plus. Our build teams operate with a very high degree of collaboration, so you will definitely have run-ins with these stacks throughout your time here.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p><p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, <strong>you can expect to make somewhere between $40,000 and $60,000 upon joining the company. </strong></p><p><strong>This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. </strong>We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in the continental United States. Thanks!</p><p><strong>Why work at Very?</strong></p><p>It’s not just about perks. It’s about solving tough problems and constantly learning, collaborating, and improving.</p><p><strong>What We Value</strong></p><p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p><p>We believe in empowering individuals to make an impact. Instead of having an org chart, we distribute authority through an approach called holacracy.</p><p><strong>Fairness</strong></p><p>We practice radical transparency, providing insight into all levels of the company, from financial performance to individual compensation.</p><p><strong>Balance</strong></p><p>We believe people do their best work when they have fulfilling lives outside of work. Ship great products, and we’ll give you the space to live your life.</p><p><strong>Yeah, but what about the perks?</strong></p><p><strong>Work where you want</strong></p><p><strong>Work from anywhere. Your home, our beautiful Chattanooga office, a co-working space, on the road, you name it. If you feel like moving, you don’t have to change jobs.</strong></p><p><strong>Level up your skills</strong></p><p>We’ll cover $2,000 annually for you to attend conferences, take courses, or learn something new. Plus we pay 100% of travel and registration costs for employees who speak at conferences. We also reserve time for internal projects and professional development.</p><p><strong>Paid parental leave</strong></p><p>When you welcome a new baby, we encourage you to take time off to bond with your child. We offer generous maternity and paternity leave for all new parents.</p><p><strong>Medical and fitness</strong></p><p>We believe that healthy bodies power healthy minds. We have many health, vision, and dental plans available through UHC, and we currently contribute a large portion to each plan. We also pay up to $70/month for your gym membership, yoga classes, or whatever you do to stay fit.</p><p><strong>401k match</strong></p><p>We match $1 for every $3 contributed up to $18,000.</p><p><strong>Home office stipend</strong></p><p>All remote employees may expense up to $60/month of their Internet service costs. Additionally, remote employees get a $1,000 home office stipend in their first year and $200/year for each subsequent year.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.verypossible.com/careers/senior-sofware-enginer-latam' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

The ambition to learn new things and continuously improve is a requirement. We are looking for someone to join us for the long term in providing the best possibles services to our customers.   <br>   <br>Voipfone runs a virtual office, meaning all our employees work from home (09:00 to 17:30 UK time), so self-motivation and reliability are essential qualities.

You will be responsible for writing documentation, as well as liaising with colleagues in the support teams to ensure end-users are provided with the best possible experience.   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>   <br>Given the nature of the projects you’ll be working on, you will require a good understanding of the following:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Programming GUIs   <br>   <br>* Cross-platform development   <br>   <br>* iOS development   <br>   <br>* Android development   <br>   <br>* macOS development   <br>   <br>* Windows development   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>While not essential, the following skills would certainly prove useful:   <br>   <br>   <br>* An eye for GUI design   <br>   <br>* Experience with frameworks such as React Native   <br>   <br>* Git version control   <br>   <br>* Knowledge of various network protocols   <br>   <br>* SIP   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>STRICTLY NO RECRUITMENT AGENCIES  </div> </div>",
