We are looking for a full-time Android developer to improve our existing Android app and work on a build automation project.</p><p>Learn about who we are, what we’re looking for, and how you can grow with us!</p><p><strong>REQUIRED EXPERIENCE</strong></p><ul><li>A solid communicator.&nbsp;<strong>We are 100% remote</strong>&nbsp;and communication means everything.</li><li>Experienced in Java and Kotlin. Our codebase is mainly in Kotlin.</li><li>Care about good software architecture, testing, and automation. Our test coverage needs to be significantly improved.</li><li>Fair understanding of RxJava and Kotlin Coroutines. While we do not require high-level knowledge of RxJava, it is used in the current codebase.</li><li>At least basic knowledge of basic Material Design principles.</li><li>Interest in learning more about user behavior through use of analytics.</li><li>3+ years experience in Android software development.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT WE DO</strong></p><p>Events are where we go to be inspired by those who’ve followed their dreams, learn from successful people, build life-long friendships, and discover new opportunities.</p><p>Our mission at Sched is to empower teams to organize life-changing events. Thousands of events depend on Sched, like tech conferences, comic conventions, music festivals, yoga festivals, professional development days, and even furry conventions. Seriously, there is an event for everything.</p><p>You’ll be building something that makes a real difference to our customers. Here’s actual feedback about what you’ll be building:</p><ul><li>I wonder what the world did before Sched…</li><li>Sched completely revolutionized our convention.</li><li>Using Sched is something I actively LOOK FORWARD TO whenever we’re getting ready to put on another event.</li></ul><p><strong>WHAT YOU’LL DO</strong></p><p>You will be the only Android engineer when you start. While you will take the lead in making most of the engineering decisions, collaboration remains a big part of your day-to-day. You will find yourself, for example, spending significant time communicating with your iOS counterpart to maintain a compatible feature set, with our support team to resolve with issues, and with the entire team on product roadmap discussions.</p><p>We keep track of progress through a loose kanban/loose agile project management approach. Each engineer is responsible for breaking down the tasks of their current project(s), laying out what they plan to implement in the cycle to-do list, and moving the task to “in-flight” when they are actively working on it.</p><p><strong>Your first two challenges in this position are to:</strong></p><ul><li>Stabilize and improve critical functionality in the existing android app.</li><li>Implement an automated build system for the Android app using iOS implementation as a rough reference.</li></ul><p><strong>PAY &amp; BENEFITS</strong></p><p>Salary is dependent on experience. Sched offers a broad suite of benefits to its employees including company-sponsored health, dental, vision, life, disability, and accidental dismemberment insurance. We offer retirement plans including a 401K and matching program. Other benefits include discretionary annual bonuses, education expenses, Paid Time Off, and other incentive programs.</p><p><strong>We are 100% remote! We get together throughout the year in incredible places like Morocco, Cambodia, and Medellín, all covered by Sched. Part work, part vacation, we call them #schedcations.</strong></p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://sched.com/careers/android-engineer/' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

This job is a great fit for pragmatic programmers with a functional bend.</p><p>Over the last few years, we’ve shipped countless Ruby on Rails projects, built full stack solutions leveraging Elixir and Phoenix, constructed models and data pipelines with Python and delighted our users utilizing in React, Native iOS and Android.</p><p>We do a lot.</p><p><strong>What You’ll Be Working On</strong></p><p>Very is first and foremost a software consultancy, we tackle hard problems for clients who need a targeted, senior team to come in and provide specific solutions.</p><p>At Very, there is a never-ending supply of variety to the types of projects we work on. In the last year, we’ve built solutions that touch e-commerce, trust management (finance), beer distribution, point of sale systems, ICO’s, identifying fake news, and much more.</p><p>You’ll spend the bulk your week (35 hours) designing and developing on a product or platform for one of our clients. The remainder can be spent contributing to our open source projects, internal products, learning, teaching, and/or participating in internal operations of all flavors.</p><p>Project teams are small and usually made up of one or two pairs of engineers, a UX engineer, a product manager, and the client who serves as the product owner. We spend most of our time building new products, with the goal of helping our clients take it to market. We are often further engaged by our clients to continue iterating on the product once it is live. The high cost of context switching is real, so we do our best to keep teams together throughout the duration of their projects (typically 3-6 months), but have found it valuable to rotate pairing partners when it makes reasonable sense.</p><p>We are always exploring new tools, languages, and technologies. We feel strongly that it’s a good idea to use the best tool for the job and not see everything as a nail. We also try our best to standardize our technology and tooling across project teams so it’s easier to rotate and practice collective code ownership. We are currently building products and platforms using the following tools/platforms:</p><p><strong>Our Current Tooling</strong></p><ul><li>React &amp; React Native</li><li>Swift &amp; Objective C</li><li>Java &amp; Kotlin</li><li>Arduino (embedded C/C++)</li><li>Ruby on Rails</li><li>Python</li><li>Elixir, Phoenix, and Nerves</li><li>Serverless</li><li>AWS</li></ul><p>You don’t need to be an expert in these tools, but familiarity is a plus. Our build teams operate with a very high degree of collaboration, so you will definitely have run-ins with these stacks throughout your time here.</p><p><strong>How You’ll Be Compensated</strong></p><p>We believe in a transparent, fair compensation structure and have developed our own open salary formula. Depending on your skill and experience, <strong>you can expect to make somewhere between $40,000 and $60,000 upon joining the company. </strong></p><p><strong>This is a full-time employment opportunity for a single individual. </strong>We’re not looking for contractors, part-time individuals, or agencies of any kind. Applicants must be located in the continental United States. Thanks!</p><p><strong>Why work at Very?</strong></p><p>It’s not just about perks. It’s about solving tough problems and constantly learning, collaborating, and improving.</p><p><strong>What We Value</strong></p><p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p><p>We believe in empowering individuals to make an impact. Instead of having an org chart, we distribute authority through an approach called holacracy.</p><p><strong>Fairness</strong></p><p>We practice radical transparency, providing insight into all levels of the company, from financial performance to individual compensation.</p><p><strong>Balance</strong></p><p>We believe people do their best work when they have fulfilling lives outside of work. Ship great products, and we’ll give you the space to live your life.</p><p><strong>Yeah, but what about the perks?</strong></p><p><strong>Work where you want</strong></p><p><strong>Work from anywhere. Your home, our beautiful Chattanooga office, a co-working space, on the road, you name it. If you feel like moving, you don’t have to change jobs.</strong></p><p><strong>Level up your skills</strong></p><p>We’ll cover $2,000 annually for you to attend conferences, take courses, or learn something new. Plus we pay 100% of travel and registration costs for employees who speak at conferences. We also reserve time for internal projects and professional development.</p><p><strong>Paid parental leave</strong></p><p>When you welcome a new baby, we encourage you to take time off to bond with your child. We offer generous maternity and paternity leave for all new parents.</p><p><strong>Medical and fitness</strong></p><p>We believe that healthy bodies power healthy minds. We have many health, vision, and dental plans available through UHC, and we currently contribute a large portion to each plan. We also pay up to $70/month for your gym membership, yoga classes, or whatever you do to stay fit.</p><p><strong>401k match</strong></p><p>We match $1 for every $3 contributed up to $18,000.</p><p><strong>Home office stipend</strong></p><p>All remote employees may expense up to $60/month of their Internet service costs. Additionally, remote employees get a $1,000 home office stipend in their first year and $200/year for each subsequent year.</p>        </div><div>        <a href='https://www.verypossible.com/careers/senior-sofware-enginer-latam' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>    </div>",

The ambition to learn new things and continuously improve is a requirement. We are looking for someone to join us for the long term in providing the best possibles services to our customers.   <br>   <br>Voipfone runs a virtual office, meaning all our employees work from home (09:00 to 17:30 UK time), so self-motivation and reliability are essential qualities.

You will be responsible for writing documentation, as well as liaising with colleagues in the support teams to ensure end-users are provided with the best possible experience.   <br>   <br>Requirements   <br>   <br>Given the nature of the projects you’ll be working on, you will require a good understanding of the following:   <br>   <br>   <br>* Programming GUIs   <br>   <br>* Cross-platform development   <br>   <br>* iOS development   <br>   <br>* Android development   <br>   <br>* macOS development   <br>   <br>* Windows development   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>While not essential, the following skills would certainly prove useful:   <br>   <br>   <br>* An eye for GUI design   <br>   <br>* Experience with frameworks such as React Native   <br>   <br>* Git version control   <br>   <br>* Knowledge of various network protocols   <br>   <br>* SIP   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   <br>STRICTLY NO RECRUITMENT AGENCIES  </div> </div>",

And yet, while the interview is a universal experience, it has never been recognized as its own discipline. In fact, the vast majority of people conducting interviews receive no formal training in how to do so.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Karat is the market leader in Interview Engineering</strong>\n<p>At Karat, our mission is to make every interview predictive, fair, and enjoyable. To do so, we created and established the category of Interview Engineering.</p>\n<p>Founded in 2014, Karat is a privately held and venture-funded company based in Seattle. Key clients include Pinterest, PayPal, Citrix, Intuit, and InVision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Interview Engineering at Karat</strong>\n<p>Karat Interview Engineers are a community of experienced software developers who are equipped with best practices and technology needed to provide the most predictive, fair, and enjoyable interviews to software engineering job candidates. Interview Engineers include software development managers, software engineers, and freelancers covering the full technology stack. As an Interview Engineer, you will interview job candidates using the Karat approach and interviewing infrastructure in a wide variety of roles on behalf of leading companies worldwide.</p>\n<p></p>\n<strong>Flexible, high impact work that is compensated at highly competitive rates.</strong>\n<p>As an Interview Engineer, you will be compensated at highly competitive rates for your interviewing expertise. &nbsp;The time commitment is flexible—many of our interviews happen on nights and weekends. &nbsp;Some experts do 10 interviews/week while others do over 25 interviews/week. &nbsp;You can work from anywhere, anytime. &nbsp;You will sharpen your interviewing skills and transform the interviewing experience for every candidate and company. Interviews are paid on a per interview basis. $100 USD per interview (60 minute interview + up to 30 minutes for the feedback report)</p>\n<p> Experienced software engineers who believe that interviewing is a first-class job Interviewing experience focused on evaluating fundamental computer science skills (i.e. data structures, algorithms etc.), software craftsmanship (i.e. understanding of unit testing, source control, APIs etc.), and/or specific technologies (i.e. iOS, distributed systems etc.) Strong oral and written communication skills Able to empathize with candidates and provide actionable feedback A genuine desire to continuously improve the Karat service and technical interviewing</p>\n<strong>About You</strong>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p> In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital/domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability status, or veteran status. Above and beyond discrimination and harassment based on “protected categories,” we also strive to prevent other subtler forms of inappropriate behavior (i.e., stereotyping) from ever gaining a foothold in our office. Whether blatant or hidden, barriers to success have no place at Karat.</p>\n<em></em>\n<strong>Statement of Non-Discrimination:</strong>\n<br>\n<p>We value a diverse workforce: people of color, womxn, and LGBTQIA+ individuals are strongly encouraged to apply.</p>\n<p>With thanks to the Level Playing Field Institute for this statement of non-discrimination.</p>\n<div> \n <a href='https://grnh.se/4c9420f62' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a>\n</div>",

Podcasts are unique in that they inspire us, help us learn something new, or captivate us with the way stories are told. Yet, all of these experiences are rarely shared with one another. By connecting people with an easy way to share and discuss podcasts, Repod helps people find and listen to great podcasts.</p>\n<p>Currently, we are a two person team (2 cofounders) and are looking for our 1st full-time team member by way of mobile engineer. We are in the midst of a public beta and will be launching in the near future.</p>\n<p>As the lead mobile engineer at Repod, you'll initially be working in our main repo developing and launching new features. Repod is built using React Native and relies heavily on a native audio player built in Swift/Java. As we expand our product, you’ll help inform the technologies used in our future growth. The team is small, which means your impact on the company’s success will be instrumental.</p>\n<p>We have one requirement — must love podcasts.</p>\n<p>Interested?

Everyone's voice is heard, and we strongly believe in the&nbsp;value&nbsp;of being part of an&nbsp;inclusive and&nbsp;diverse team that works closely together.</p>\n <p>The&nbsp;size of our team is small enough to allow everyone to be equally involved and have a clear view of the big picture. We won’t bore you with a single never-ending subtask of a subtask. Meetings and interruptions are always kept to a minimum. We want to you to do work that matters and work that you are proud of.&nbsp;</p>\n <p><strong>Who we're looking for</strong></p>\n <p>We're looking&nbsp;for team members that are enjoy&nbsp;working on all the aspects of developing&nbsp;and evolving an iOS app.&nbsp;From the deep inner workings of the application’s backend architecture and scaling to polishing the animations of the UI and working with our support team to diagnose an issue that a user is having. We require at least 3 years of iOS development experience&nbsp;and you must be able to show at least one real-world project where you have made a significant contribution.</p>\n <p>It's important to know that we're&nbsp;looking for a full-time exclusive collaboration that will last for years and evolve over time.

After that each member of team will be working on their assigned tasks alone or in coordination with other members of the team developing new features, squashing bugs, prototyping, updating the UI or experimenting with new technologies or the next crazy idea that might change the world.</p>\n <p>We practice Agile development and plan our work on a&nbsp;fifteen-day sprints so there will be regular meetings every second Monday, Thursday and Friday to start a new sprint, plan ahead and show the rest of the team what has be done. There are very few other meetings during the sprint because we have actual work to do ;) That's it!</p>\n <p><strong>What we offer</strong></p>\n <p>We offer a great salary, paid vacation time, financial support for opportunities that will help you grow as professional&nbsp;and&nbsp;we reward every team member with additional bonuses and benefits for outstanding work and personal or team goals achieved.</p>\n <p>If that sounds like what you're looking for, just apply for the position and we'll reach to set up a meeting to get to know you better.</p> \n</div> \n<div> \n <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/jobs/apply/276716?reset=False&amp;ra=1uNIKvCk9BHa&amp;oqs=a%3D1uNIKvCk9BHa' rel='nofollow'>Apply now</a>\n</div>\n<div> \n</div>",

Our speak up culture is strong. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Remote first:&nbsp;Our team is fully distributed, and we work hard at that, but feel free to work from any of our offices in Paris, London, Brussels or Casablanca. \n  <br> \n  <br>* The courage to fail:&nbsp;We celebrate the wins, but more importantly we're not afraid to fail, we always learn and go again. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Team Unity: No one is left behind. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Code quality:&nbsp;It's not software without tests. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What will be your role? \n  <br> \n  <br>We're hiring for talent, not location, that is why you will find members of our group based remotely throughout Europe. You'll join one of our cross-functional product team and will be its proud iOS representative. There are plenty of challenges each of them are tackling at the moment such as: \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Driver: create a scalable and reliable platform used by dozen of thousands of drivers on a daily basis \n  <br> \n  <br>* Payment: make in-app payment management \n  <br> \n  <br>* easy as pie for users. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Ride flow: improve our ride flow by making it more modular while we are expanding in new countries with completely different approaches of using the product \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>... and many others! \n  <br> \n  <br>Does it sound like you? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* You have more than 5 years of experience in iOS development. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You also have at least 2 years of experience in using Reactive programming. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You've already worked with Swift in Production. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You understand the iOS SDK and application lifecycle. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You've got knowledge in common architectural patterns. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You're skilled in UI using ConstraintLayout. \n  <br> \n  <br>* You're thorough when it comes to test coverage and other best practices. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>Bonus points ;) \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you have contributed to open source projects, it would be a plus. \n  <br> \n  <br>* If you know about managing the lifecycle of background services and their impact on battery usage, it would also be a bonus. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What will you do? \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work closely with Product, Backend and Data Analysts to build highly impactful features. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work in a release train cycle (we ship often ). \n  <br> \n  <br>* Optimise performance and help solve technical and product problems for our large pool of iOS drivers \n  <br> \n  <br>* Be a vital member of the broader iOS team at Heetch and contribute to core architecture and design discussions. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Work closely with engineers from other product teams building cross-team features at scale. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Participate in Code Reviews and provide feedback to your colleagues. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Share knowledge with everyone and help your team to grow. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Have the freedom to experiment. Intrigued by a new tech or library? Go for it! Let's see how it improves our services. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Routinely own and manage releases to the App store. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What will be your main challenges? \n  <br> \n  <br>Our app is one, of the few mobile apps, running in the foreground for up to seven hours straight on drivers phones. This rather unique use case brings fun challenges with handling the lifecycle of the app. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Network and GPS management: We need to provide accurate information and price suggestions to our community. This means making sure every driver gets important notifications in any network conditions, providing GPS location as accurate as possible for the pricing and tracking. \n  <br> \n  <br>* UI &amp; UX: Ride-sharing apps are a really special case in app design. They all revolve around a map and the conventional navigation patterns like list view and navigation controls need heavy tweaking to make for great user experience. \n  <br> \n  <br>* One way data flow and functional pattern: We are passionate about software architecture. We've built the core of our apps using Rx and want to push this forward in both the data and the UI layers. Ideally, our team will grow big enough to be able to push forward what mobile programming means and we'll contribute back to all those amazing open source projects we learned from. \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>What's next? \n  <br> \n  <br>If your application is selected, the process will be composed of 4 steps: \n  <br> \n  <br>* Non-technical interview with the Engineering Manager of your potential team (1h30) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Take home assignment (~5 days deadline) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Interview with your future teammates (1h) \n  <br> \n  <br>* Day on site (Paris) to meet your future stakeholders \n  <br> \n  <br> \n </div> \n</div>",

    "content": "<span><h3>Humbly Confident Senior Mobile Developer</h3></span> \n<br> \n<span><h4>You Need a Budget</h4></span> \n<div> \n <div> \n  <br>About Us and Why We’re Hiring \n  <br> \n  <br>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;Google us, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives. \n  <br> \n  <br>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. \n  <br> \n  <br>We have some big plans for our iOS (iPad, Apple Watch) and Android apps, and that’s where you might come in. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original Cultural Manifesto has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! \n  <br> \n  <br>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of professional software development experience, with at least 4 of those years spent writing iOS and/or Android apps. But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. \n  <br> \n  <br>Who you’d be working with: \n  <br> \n  <br>Our developer team is about 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. \n  <br> \n  <br>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier. \n  <br> \n  <br>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. \n  <br> \n  <br>How You’ll Work at YNAB \n  <br> \n  <br>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate: \n  <br> \n  <br>Live Where You Want \n  <br> \n  <br>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection. \n  <br> \n  <br>No Crazy Hours \n  <br> \n  <br>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours. \n  <br> \n  <br>Take Vacation (Seriously) \n  <br> \n  <br>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall. \n  <br> \n  <br>The YNAB Retreat \n  <br> \n  <br>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on Laguna Beach. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast. \n  <br> \n  <br>Up Your Game \n  <br> \n  <br>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow. \n  <br> \n  <br>If You’re International... \n  <br> \n  <br>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. \n  <br> \n  <br>If You’re Stateside… \n  <br> \n  <br>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!) \n  <br> \n  <br>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.) \n  <br> \n  <br>Other Tidbits \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>* Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) \n  <br> \n  <br>* The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer. \n  <br> \n  <br>* We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years. \n  <br> \n  <br>* Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one! \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br> \n  <br>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. You will change lives. \n  <br> \n  <br>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer… \n  <br> \n  <br>You're a software developer with over 5 years of professional, full time experience. At least four of those have been spent working with iOS or Android, or both. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap. \n  <br> \n  <br>You'll help us maintain and implement new features in our mobile apps.

(But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. &nbsp;<a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'>Google us</a>, or read some of our <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8' rel='nofollow'>reviews on the app store</a>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p>\n <p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p>\n <p>We have some big plans for our iOS (iPad, Apple Watch) and Android apps, and that’s where you might come in. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original<a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'> Cultural Manifesto</a> has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p>\n <p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of professional software development experience, with at least 4 of those years spent writing iOS and/or Android apps. But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></strong></p>\n <p>Our developer team is about 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.</p>\n <p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s <em>external</em> competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p>\n <p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></strong></p>\n <p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p>\n <p><strong><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></strong></p>\n <p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></strong></p>\n <p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></strong></p>\n <p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></strong></p>\n <p>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done<a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'> Costa Rica</a>, a <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'>gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'>Laguna Beach</a>. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>Up Your Game</strong></strong></p>\n <p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>If You’re International...</strong></strong></p>\n <p>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</p>\n <p><strong><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></strong></p>\n <p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p>\n <p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em> <em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p>\n <p><strong><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li>\n  <li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li>\n  <li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li>\n  <li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li>\n  <li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li>\n  <li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li>\n </ul>\n <p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. <em>You will change lives. </em></p>\n <p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…</strong></p>\n <p>You're a software developer with over 5 years of professional, full time experience. At least four of those have been spent working with iOS or Android, or both. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.</p>\n <p>You'll help us maintain and implement new features in our mobile apps. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library that is currently based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across all of our platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help.</p>\n <p>Technologies we use on Android (current baseline is Marshmallow):</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Kotlin for development</li>\n  <li>Moving towards an MVI architecture</li>\n  <li>Integrating with V8 JS engine</li>\n  <li>RxJava, Dagger, Robolectric</li>\n </ul>\n <p>Technologies we use on iOS (current baseline is iOS 11):</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Swift for any new development - we are slowly migrating the existing codebase over from Objective-C</li>\n  <li>Leveraging JavaScriptCore for our shared library integration</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li>\n  <li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li>\n  <li>Have excellent debugging skills.

    "content": "<h3>Senior Mobile Developer at <span>You Need A Budget - YNAB</span></h3>\n<div>\n <span><i></i> Remote</span> | \n <span> International </span>\n</div>\n<div> \n <p><strong>Anywhere </strong></p>\n <p><strong>Full-time </strong></p>\n <p><strong>Allows remote</strong></p>\n <p><strong>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</strong></p>\n <p>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. Google us, or read some of our reviews on the app store, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</p>\n <p>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul.</p>\n <p>We have some big plans for our iOS (iPad, Apple Watch) and Android apps, and that’s where you might come in. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original Cultural Manifesto has to really <em>click</em> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in!</p>\n <p>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of professional software development experience, with at least 4 of those years spent writing iOS and/or Android apps. But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for.</p>\n <p><strong>Who you’d be working with:</strong></p>\n <p>Our developer team is about 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you’ll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company.</p>\n <p>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s <em>external</em> competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</p>\n <p>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort.</p>\n <p><strong>How You’ll Work at YNAB</strong></p>\n <p>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</p>\n <p><strong>Live Where You Want</strong></p>\n <p>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</p>\n <p><strong>No Crazy Hours</strong></p>\n <p>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</p>\n <p><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></p>\n <p>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</p>\n <p><strong>The YNAB Retreat</strong></p>\n <p><strong>We get the teams together once a year</strong> to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done Costa Rica, a gigantic cabin in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on Laguna Beach. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</p>\n <p><strong>Up Your Game</strong></p>\n <p>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new….We love to see our people grow.</p>\n <p><strong>If You’re International…</strong></p>\n <p><strong>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>If You’re Stateside…</strong></p>\n <p>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you <em>and your family.</em> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</p>\n <p>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not <em>your retirement</em> <em>nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</p>\n <p><strong>Other Tidbits</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!)</li>\n  <li>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring.</li>\n  <li>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</li>\n  <li>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried <em>standing</em>?) in front of a computer.</li>\n  <li>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</li>\n  <li>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</li>\n </ul>\n <p>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. <em>You will change lives.</em></p>\n <p><strong>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…</strong></p>\n <p>You’re a software developer with over 5 years of professional, full time experience. At least four of those have been spent working with iOS or Android, or both. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap.</p>\n <p>You’ll help us maintain and implement new features in our mobile apps. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library that is currently based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across all of our platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don’t have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Marshmallow on Android and iOS 10 on iOS. You’ll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you’ll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app.</p>\n <p><strong>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</strong></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</li>\n  <li>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</li>\n  <li>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</li>\n  <li>Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:\n   <ul>\n    <li>“This part of the program is too slow. Can you find out why?”</li>\n    <li>“This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?”</li>\n    <li>“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”</li>\n   </ul></li>\n  <li>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</li>\n  <li>Have experience with either:\n   <ul>\n    <li>Kotlin and Java</li>\n    <li>Swift and Objective-C</li>\n   </ul></li>\n  <li>Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.</li>\n  <li>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</li>\n  <li>Are a <em>senior</em> developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</li>\n  <li>“Bonus points” awarded if you already use and love YNAB. </li>\n </ul>\n <p>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for <em>all</em> employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</p> \n</div>\n<div> \n <a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9oz' rel='nofollow'>Apply for job</a> \n</div>",

    "content": "**About Us and Why We’re Hiring**We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. [Google us](https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab), or [read some of our reviews on the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8), and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. We have some big plans for our iOS (iPad, Apple Watch) and Android apps, and that’s where you might come in. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original [Cultural Manifesto](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit) has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of professional software development experience, with at least 4 of those years spent writing iOS and/or Android apps. But first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. **Who you’d be working with:**Our developer team is about 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s external competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. **How You’ll Work at YNAB**We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:**Live Where You Want**We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.**No Crazy Hours**We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.**Take Vacation (Seriously)**We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a minimum vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.**The YNAB Retreat**We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done [Costa Rica](https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343), [a gigantic cabin](https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/) in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on [Laguna Beach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be). We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.**Up Your Game**We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.**If You’re International...**You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. **If You’re Stateside…**You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not your retirement nest egg. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)**Other Tidbits**- Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) - The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. - We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.- We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried standing?) in front of a computer.- We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.- Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. You will change lives. **Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…**You're a software developer with over 5 years of professional, full time experience. At least four of those have been spent working with iOS or Android, or both. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap. You'll help us maintain and implement new features in our mobile apps. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library that is currently based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across all of our platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Marshmallow on Android and iOS 10 on iOS. You'll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you'll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app. **You’re the one we’re looking for if you:**- Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.- Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.- Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.- Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:- &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This part of the program is too slow. Can you find out why?&quot; - &gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?&quot;- &gt;&gt;&gt;“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”- Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.- Have experience with either:- &gt;&gt;&gt;Kotlin and Java- &gt;&gt;&gt;Swift and Objective-C- Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.- Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.- Are a senior developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.- “Bonus points” awarded if you already use and love YNAB. :)YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.**How to Apply**- Apply [here](https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9oz) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on **June 30th, 2019**. Firm. It’s a real deadline.- First, you don’t need a resume! Many of our job applicants don’t have one because many weren’t even looking to change jobs! An informal list of your work and education history are all we’re looking for anyway, and you are welcome to include that in your cover letter. Speaking of which:- You DO need a cover letter. Attach a pdf of your cover letter. In your cover letter:- &gt;&gt;&gt;Introduce yourself and explain why this position is of interest to you, and **why you would be a great fit for the position**. (It’s okay to brag and not be humble for this part!).- &gt;&gt;&gt;Please tell us about apps or anything you’ve built that makes you look good, and describe your role in those projects. (Include links if applicable)- &gt;&gt;&gt;Include the phrase “I am not a bot, spammer, recruiter, or agency.” somewhere in your cover letter.- Includes answers to the following questions:- &gt;&gt;&gt;What are your two strongest programming languages? How much experience do you have with them? - &gt;&gt;&gt;Briefly (no more than a few sentences) describe a proud “debugging” moment you had, where you found and fixed a bug.- &gt;&gt;&gt;If you were interviewing a prospective candidate for this position, what would be a good interview question to ask to find out if a candidate really knew their stuff?- Complete this short coding test [(https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb)](https://www.interviewzen.com/apply/sffVTb) and include a link to your results in your cover letter. It shouldn’t take more than 30 minutes or so.We look forward to hearing from you!P.S. If you’re not interested in or available for this position, but know someone who is, we would really appreciate it if you passed this along!",

    "content": "<h3> Humbly Confident Senior Mobile Developer </h3>\n<div>\n <div>\n  <span><h3><span>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</span></h3></span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We build “You Need a Budget” the best budgeting software around. (But people in the know call us YNAB, which is pronounced “why-nab”). For more than a decade, people have been buying YNAB and then telling their friends what a difference it has made in their lives. </span>\n  <a href='https://www.google.com/search?q=ynab' rel='nofollow'><span>Google us</span></a>\n  <span>, or read some of our </span>\n  <a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ynab-you-need-a-budget/id1010865877?mt=8' rel='nofollow'><span>reviews on the app store</span></a>\n  <span>, and you’ll see what we mean. We love building something that has a huge positive impact on people’s lives.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We’re profitable, bootstrapped, and growing. YNAB started in 2004 and we haven’t taken any outside funding—we’re in it for the long haul. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We have some big plans for our iOS (iPad, Apple Watch) and Android apps, and that’s where you might come in. </span>\n  <span>We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original</span>\n  <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/16hufsixsrv1j2jZkWUgQmeKpNfQRsacnnK2xTVwO0ew/edit?usp=sharing' rel='nofollow'><span></span><span>Cultural Manifesto</span></a>\n  <span> has to really </span>\n  <em>click</em>\n  <span> with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably fit right in! </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>Of course, we have some other hard requirements too, like 5 years of professional software development experience, with at least 4 of those years spent writing iOS and/or Android apps. But </span>\n  <span>first, let’s talk about life at YNAB and then we’ll go into detail about what we’re looking for. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h3>Who you'd be working with:</h3>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>Our developer team is about 15 people strong, and we frequently work in cross-functional teams, so you'll get to work with awesome people in all different roles in the company. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>Regardless of their varied interests, all of our developers have one thing in common: They are a joy to work with. You won’t find heated arguments and raised voices here. We save our competitive spirit for YNAB’s </span>\n  <em>external</em>\n  <span> competitors (or the occasional spirited board game session), but internally we build up our teammates and celebrate their successes. We all love to program and solve problems in clever ways, and we regularly take time to geek out and show each other something cool we built or found to make our lives easier.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>And of course, as a developer, you’ll work closely with our designers, who are amazing. They have the awards (including at least one actual Emmy) to prove they’re good at designing stuff, but there are plenty of skilled designers out there. More importantly, they are welcoming of feedback and suggestions during the development process, and will be happy to tweak an interaction if you tell them that it will save you significant development effort. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h3>How You'll Work at YNAB</h3>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We work really hard to make working at YNAB an amazing experience. We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. Here’s how we operate:</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>Live Where You Want</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We’re a distributed team, so you can live and work wherever you want. Proximity doesn’t influence productivity. Just make sure you have a reliable internet connection.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>No Crazy Hours</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We rarely work more than 40 hours per week. There have been a few occasions where things got a little crazy and people had to log some extra hours. But then they took some extra time off, so it all balances out. We work hard and smart but we’re in this for the long haul, no need to go crazy on the hours.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>Take Vacation (Seriously)</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a </span>\n  <em>minimum</em>\n  <span> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for Holiday break). It’s important to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your vacation in our internal chat room, creatively named #office_wall.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>The YNAB Retreat</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We get the teams together once a year to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. So far, we’ve done</span>\n  <a href='https://vimeo.com/youneedabudget/review/120084054/93e11d6343' rel='nofollow'><span> Costa Rica</span></a>\n  <span>, a </span>\n  <a href='https://www.youneedabudget.com/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong/' rel='nofollow'><span>gigantic cabin</span></a>\n  <span> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, and took over a hotel on </span>\n  <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE&amp;feature=youtu.be' rel='nofollow'><span>Laguna Beach</span></a>\n  <span>. We do really fun things at these retreats, but the highlight is inevitably just being with each together and having a blast.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>Up Your Game</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. We budget for it (hey-o!). Think conferences, Lynda/Skillshare subscriptions, books, and dedicated time away from work to learn something new....We love to see our people grow.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>If You’re International...</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>You’ll be set up as a contractor. Employee or contractor, it’s all the same to us. You’re part of the team. As for time zones, we’re flexible as long as a decent chunk of your time overlaps with North American time zones. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>If You’re Stateside…</span></h5>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>You’ll be a W2 employee with fantastic health, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you </span>\n  <em>and your family.</em>\n  <span> (No need to check your vision, you read that right, 100%. Although if you did need to check your vision, no big deal, we’ve got you covered!)</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>We also have Traditional and Roth 401k options. YNAB contributes three percent whether you choose to throw any money in there or not. It vests immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, not </span>\n  <em>your retirement</em>\n  <span></span>\n  <em>nest egg</em>\n  <span>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a personal finance junkie? Then trust us, it’s great.)</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>Other Tidbits</span></h5>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li><span>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </span><br></li>\n  <li><span>The bucket list helps in deciding what we should give you for your birthday and Christmas: No gift cards here. We tried that. Super boring. </span><br></li>\n  <li><span>We have a bonus plan based on profitability. You’ll be in on that from day one. YNAB wins, you win. That kind of thing.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>We’re all adults. There’s no need to punch a clock, or ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to go see the doctor (health insurance premium 100% covered!). We look at what you’re accomplishing, not how long you sit (have you tried </span><em>standing</em><span>?) in front of a computer.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>We want you firing on all cylinders so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Did I mention we make a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? We have a Slack channel where we share success stories from our customers daily. It’s amazing. Don’t underestimate this one!</span><br><br></li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <span>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you. You will play a big part in helping YNAB delight users and give them control of their money. </span>\n  <span>&nbsp;</span>\n  <em>You will change lives. </em>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h3><span>Now, back to you, our new Mobile Developer…</span></h3>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>You're a software developer with over 5 years of professional, full time experience. At least four of those have been spent working with iOS or Android, or both. You know how to write easy-to-maintain software while still keeping an eye on the roadmap. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>You'll help us maintain and implement new features in our mobile apps. We have native implementations for each platform but use a shared library that is currently based on TypeScript for things that, well, need to be shared across all of our platforms. For performance and maintainability reasons there is plenty of SQL code as well. You don't have to be an expert on TypeScript or SQL, but being curious about how things work on that layer will definitely help. Our baselines are Marshmallow on Android and iOS 10 on iOS. You'll get to work with things like Kotlin and RxJava on Android. On iOS you'll work with Objective-C and Swift on a universal app and an Apple watch app. </span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h5><span>You’re the one we’re looking for if you:</span></h5>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li><span>Are an excellent developer and can adapt to new languages quickly.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Write code that is easy for other programmers and your future self to understand and use.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Have excellent debugging skills. You know how to find problems, and how to architect apps so that problems are discoverable in the first place.</span><br></li>\n  <li><span>Are self-motivated and thrive with directions like:</span></li>\n  <li>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This part of the program is too slow. Can you find out why?&quot;</li>\n  <li>&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;This component needs to be re-architected to allow for X. How do you think we should do it?&quot;<br></li>\n  <li>&gt;&gt;&gt;“Our code needs to call into a Javascript library, but that Javascript library is crashing because it can’t find the setTimeout method. Can you investigate?”</li>\n  <li><span>Are excited to work across multiple platforms with different technologies.</span></li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>Have experience with either:</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <li>&gt;&gt;&gt;Kotlin and Java<br></li>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <div>\n  <li>&gt;&gt;&gt;Swift and Objective-C<br></li>\n </div>\n <div></div>\n <div></div>\n <ul>\n  <li><span>Have shipped or helped ship at least one significant app for either iOS or Android.</span></li>\n  <li><span>Have an understanding of algorithms and data structures beyond arrays and “for loops”. That doesn’t mean you have to be a computer science PhD or even that you have to know “Big O” notation, but you should know when to use a Dictionary/Map, and why finding an element in a sorted array is faster than finding an element in an unsorted array.</span></li>\n  <li><span>Are a </span><em>senior</em><span> developer who can point to strong experience where you’ve exemplified the bullet points above.</span></li>\n </ul>\n <ul>\n  <li>“Bonus points” awarded if you already use and love YNAB. :)</li>\n </ul>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <span>YNAB is an equal opportunity employer. We believe diversity of backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences to be critical to our success and are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for </span>\n  <em>all</em>\n  <span> employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team who love working together to build something that matters.</span>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <br>\n </div>\n <div>\n  <h3><span>How to Apply</span></h3>\n </div>\n <ul>\n  <li><span>Apply here (<a href='https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9oz' rel='nofollow'>https://ynab.recruiterbox.com/jobs/fk0j9oz</a>) by 11:59PM Pacific Time, on </span><span><b>June 30th, 2019</b></span><span>.</span><span> Firm.
