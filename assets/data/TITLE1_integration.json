If so we want you!</span></p><p><span>We like to build stuff… sometimes complicated stuff… for Non Profits, Charities and Art Galleries. We’re on the lookout for a confident and ambitious Data Integration Engineer to join our fast growing startup to help us build and automate complex data integrations for our clients and platforms.</span></p><p><span>We do things a little differently, basing all our solutions on open source products, offer a great work-life balance with flexible working hours and a real team mentality.</span></p><p><span>Our work covers web design, app development and branding for Charities and non-profit organisations across the country. Our clients include Charities such as Wikimedia and Farm Africa, art galleries such as the Photographers Gallery and Craft Central but also companies, trade associations and government bodies.</span></p><p><span>The role will comprise of 2 main elements. Most of our projects will involve a degree of data integration or migration and so we are looking to have a dedicated member of the team to work on these elements of the projects. We want to develop an automated and scalable architecture that can be used in a flexible way across large client projects.</span></p><p><span>The other element of the role will be to be part of the infrastructure team in a devops/sysadmin capacity. You would also become a key architect in helping us to develop a robust SAS platform for a major SaaS product we are developing for Non Profit Organisations around the world.</span></p><p><span>The ideal candidate will have:</span></p><ul><li><span>Excellent SQL skills &nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Experience of building ETL solutions using Python (2+ years), </span><span>Apache Airflow,</span><span> or applicable experience with other Extract Transform and Load tools such as &nbsp;Pentaho, Talend*</span></li><li><span>Confidence in a Linux &amp; PHP (LAMP/LEMP) Environment</span></li><li><span>Previous experience with CI/DevOps tools platforms (i.e. Jenkins, Chef, Puppet, Ansible) nice to have</span></li><li><span>Is meticulous and loves documentation!</span></li><li><span>Is a real team player who likes to muck in and get the job done!</span></li></ul><p><span>*Most of our latest tools are Python based and as such we have a preference for Python skills.</span></p><p><span>What were looking for is someone who can grasp concepts quickly, has great attention to detail, and most importantly loves a tech challenge. In short, we’re a young team of self confessed geeks who love tinkering and tweaking until something is just right and are looking for someone who thinks and acts like us.</span></p><p><span>If you live and breath SQL and know your left joins from your inner joins then we would love to hear from you.</span></p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p>At Compucorp we are a distributed team and we welcome people to join us from all around the world, however as a UK based Company some overlap with UK hours will be required. By default you should assume that your working hours would be +/- 3h max from GMT start times of 9.00AM&nbsp;UK start time. There is some flexibility in this but please be aware that staff members starting outside of these hours are rare and as such if you would expect these hours to be an issue for you then we would not suggest that you apply.&nbsp;</p><p>For the&nbsp;Data Engineer role, due to EU data protection requirements, the team member must be from either an EEA country or a country that the EU considers to have adequate level of data protection.
