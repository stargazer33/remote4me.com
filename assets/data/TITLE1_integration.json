They are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because they have the context of what's important.\\n\\nWe don't require engineers to already be familiar with the technologies we use.

To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.\\n\\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.\\n\\nWe communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.\\n\\nTO APPLY\\n\\nWe're delighted to hear about you! Send us your CV, with a focus on what you can bring to the team. Please include in your cover letter a paragraph about something you worked on that you found technically appealing or exciting.  </div> </div>",

Balena engineers take pride on accomplishing more with less by exponentially increasing their productivity through automation and internal tooling, and we are never afraid to question established software development practices, and pioneer our own, to improve the way we work.</p><p>As a build pipeline engineer, you will be working on our cross-platform in-house continuous integration system; on internal tools that range from automatic versioning based on commit conventions, to automated project landing website generation; and on discussing and implementing innovative deployment tools and processes within the distributed systems world.</p><p>A successful build pipeline engineer is a well-rounded generalist and great communicator that take pride on maximizing the output of their team. They are eager to take responsibility for a project, and are able to make good decisions about the project because they have the context of what's important.</p><p>We don't require engineers to already be familiar with the technologies we use.

To us, this means being highly productive while still maintaining a healthy work-life balance. You need to be able to work remotely, and have a dependable internet access available so you can join video calls.</p><p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We value knowledge and initiative more than educational and personal backgrounds, age, or location. We maintain a work environment in which team members are treated with respect at all times and in which thoughts and ideas can be shared openly.</p><p>We communicate proposals, discuss with others in the team and accept feedback if it makes the result better. We value the ability to learn, which is more important to us than knowledge of specific technologies. We know that learning fast means being outside our comfort zone, which is OK -- we'd rather learn than let our assumptions get in our way.</p><p><strong>TO APPLY</strong></p><p>We're delighted to hear about you! Send us your CV, with a focus on what you can bring to the team. Please include in your cover letter a paragraph about something you worked on that you found technically appealing or exciting.</p>                </div>            <div>        <a href='https://balena.workable.com/j/16DDFD64E1' rel='nofollow'>                        Apply now        </a></div>            <h4>About Balena</h4>            <div><p>Balena&nbsp;provides a software platform that helps developers build, deploy and manage code on connected devices. We brought Docker to embedded GNU/Linux devices in 2013 and have been building our IoT toolkit ever since. We also maintain a variety of successful open source projects including&nbsp;<a href='https://etcher.io/' rel='nofollow'>Etcher</a>, <a href='https://www.balena.io/open' rel='nofollow'>openBalena</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/engine' rel='nofollow'>balenaEngine</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://www.balena.io/os/' rel='nofollow'>balenaOS</a>, and made contributions to high-exposure projects such as&nbsp;<a href='https://www.docker.com/' rel='nofollow'>Docker</a>,&nbsp;<a href='https://electronjs.org/' rel='nofollow'>Electron</a>, and&nbsp;<a href='https://appimage.org/' rel='nofollow'>AppImage</a>.</p><p>Our technology is open, standards-based, and proven in production across a wide range of scenarios from drones, 3D printers, point-of-sale devices, tidal turbines, skyscrapers and more. Our investors include DFJ, Aspect Ventures, GE, and Ericsson.</p><p>Balena&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href='https://resin.io/team/' rel='nofollow'>highly distributed, remote-friendly company</a>&nbsp;with a pretty much flat hierarchy. Our organization is adaptive, getting feedback signals from our users and systems. Right now we organize ourselves by projects, which allow us to build complex features and solve big problems, while staying mutable. As a distributed group, we rely on clear communication and the rule of &quot;assume positive intent&quot; to help us work together across time zones, cultures and first languages. Our base of operations is nominally London, though really we are living all over the world: from Barcelona to Bulgaria, Argentina to Vietnam, and many more.</p>            </div>                            <h4>Benefits</h4>                    <ul>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work with extremely talented, distributed team</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Work remotely</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Flexible working hours</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Equipment of your choice</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>Annual company gathering in an international location</span>                            </li>                            <li>                                <span></span>                                <span>We send you hardware for side projects!</span>                            </li>                    </ul>                ",
