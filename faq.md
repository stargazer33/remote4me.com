### Q: Why another job aggregator ?

Job ads are posted on multiple job boards. Very often the job boards set the checkbox “Remote” on jobs without really checking the content. Some jobs clearly indicate it: “work from whenever you want”. But other jobs contain phrases like "remotely on Friday" or "occasional remote working" - which indicates an onsite job.

The author found no site capable to do both the aggregation and the correct classification “remote vs onsite job”. Additionally, the per-technology-stack job classification of existing job boards/aggregators is far from optimal (all the Javascript, Java and, let say, Python jobs are in one huge list: have fun searching it).

Therefore this site was built. It distinguishes between the “100% remote” and the “50% remote” jobs. And it categorizes tech jobs by position and technology stack. Additionally, it tags the job ads with the time zone and work authorization tags.
  
### Q: What does “a 100% remote job” mean ?
A job which can be done without a single visit to the office. There could be timezone restrictions or restrictions related to work authorization. But, there should be no requirement to visit the office.
    
### Q: What does “a 50% remote job” mean ?
A job requiring some presence in office. Or a job where the remote option is not for all but only for “exceptional” candidates. 
Here a few examples:

"We all work remotely but meet for two days once a month on site."<br>
"Home based with travel 1 day per week"<br>
"Flexibility of remote work and hours, with an expectation to be on-site at least part time"<br>
"Telecommute or work from our … office"<br> 
"Possibility of working remotely is available."<br>
"May consider remote for a highly qualified candidate"<br>
