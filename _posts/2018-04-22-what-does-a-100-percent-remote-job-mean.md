A job which can be done without unnecessary visits to the office. There could be timezone restrictions or restrictions related to work authorization. But, there should be no requirement to visit the office.

Here a few examples:

"team is entirely remote"<br>
"... would be able to work remotely from where you want, as long as you have a good internet"<br>
"this is a full time position, were you would be able to work remotely from where you want"<br>
"if you are working remotely, you will need to be in a European timezone so that we can communicate effectively during business hours"<br>
"... US-Based Remote Applicants only"<br>
"... working remotely with a distributed team"<br>
"... a small team of about 30 people, all working remotely across the US & Canada"<br>
"... is proud to be a distributed company made up of entirely remote developers"<br>
