Job ads are posted on multiple job boards. Very often the job boards set the checkbox “Remote” on jobs without really checking the content. Some jobs clearly indicate it: “work from whenever you want”. But other jobs contain phrases like "remotely on Friday" or "occasional remote working" - which indicates an onsite job.

The author found no site capable to do both the aggregation and the correct classification “remote vs onsite job”. Additionally, the per-technology-stack job classification of existing job boards/aggregators is far from optimal (all the Javascript, Java and, let say, Python jobs are in one huge list: have fun searching it).

Therefore this site was built. It distinguishes between the <a href="/faq/2018/04/22/what-does-a-100-percent-remote-job-mean" >"100% remote"</a> and the <a href="/faq/2018/04/25/what-does-a-50-percent-remote-job-mean">"50% remote"</a> jobs. And it categorizes tech jobs by position and technology stack. Additionally, it tags the job ads with the time zone and work authorization tags.
