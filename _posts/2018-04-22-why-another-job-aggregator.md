Job ads are posted on multiple job boards. Very often the job boards set the checkbox “Remote” on jobs without really checking the content. Some jobs clearly indicate it: “work from whenever you want”. But other jobs contain phrases like "remotely on Friday" or "occasional remote working" - which indicates an onsite job.

The author found no site capable to do both the aggregation and the correct classification “remote vs onsite job”. Additionally, the per-technology-stack job classification of existing job boards/aggregators is far from optimal (all the Javascript, Java and, let say, Python jobs are in one huge list: have fun searching it).

Therefore this site was built. It distinguishes between the “100% remote” and the “50% remote” jobs. And it categorizes tech jobs by position and technology stack. Additionally, it tags the job ads with the time zone and work authorization tags.
