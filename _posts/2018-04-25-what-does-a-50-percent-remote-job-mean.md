A job requiring some presence in office. Or a job where the remote option is not for all but only for “exceptional” candidates. 
Here a few examples:

"We all work remotely but meet for two days once a month on site."<br>
"Home based with travel 1 day per week"<br>
"Flexibility of remote work and hours, with an expectation to be on-site at least part time"<br>
"Telecommute or work from our … office"<br> 
"Possibility of working remotely is available."<br>
"May consider remote for a highly qualified candidate"<br>
