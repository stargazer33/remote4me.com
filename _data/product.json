    "content": "*About Us*<br /><br />We are building the future of insurance by offering a new perspective on risk that makes insuring you, and your lifestyle, easy. The future of insurance is mobile first. The future of insurance is app first. The future of insurance is Wrisk. It’s a big claim, sure, but we mean it, which is why we need your help.<br /><br />We are well funded for the journey ahead and have already won strong support from the likes of BMW and Munich Re.<br /><br /><br />*Insurance?!*<br /><br />To be honest, it is a miracle you are reading this. Why? Because most of the folks who would be a natural fit in the team at Wrisk would have probably stopped reading after they saw the word “insurance…”.<br /><br />Okay? But Insurance? The truth is that insurance has a major image problem and that is just one of the many things we’re going to fix. Join us (we are currently nine full time, plus an enviable team of advisors), and you’ll be joining a small team who punch well above their weight; we feel, and act like the high-performing #insurtech startup we are, and not the a Financial Services companies we hope to unseat.<br /><br />But don’t take our word for it - come visit our offices at TechHub (Friday is Desk Drinks, Showcase and Retrospective), talk to the team, and see for yourself.<br /><br /><br />*How We Work*<br /><br />We believe in, and practice, the lean startup ideas of build/measure/learn, and will be very happy to show you the kanban storyboard you will be building from. You will participate in, and often lead, our retrospectives, as well as presenting at the fortnightly showcases, to the wider team, which are essential for ensuring we are all on the same page.<br /><br />We typically start with a workshop to define what we need to achieve, leading to wireframes and perhaps some high level tasks. We refine and test until we believe we have the core of what we want and then we build the smallest amount we can to validate this - sometimes in code, sometimes in prototype. <br /><br />We do regular user testing, rapid prototyping and code spikes to ensure we only build the most-right thing we can right now. Darius was Head of UX (ThoughtWorks) and Head of Product (Isotrak) so agile product management and user experience are truly in our blood.<br /><br /><br />*What we're looking for...*<br /><br />You, of course - a talented community manager - but we’re hoping you’ll bring much more than that. You’ll...<br /><br />*Be an excellent communicator* - As the conduit to our customer community, in many ways you are the face of our brand. We think you’ll need to be a master communicator, able to assess, and engage, with audiences. You're a journalistic chameleon, able to craft a well written long-form article with professional flair, yet also communicate concepts through a string of simple, creative, words (and emoji). All in our tone of voice and with sincerity and authenticity.<br /><br />*Take it offline* - We think community management at Wrisk will go beyond the online world. You'll be comfortable interacting with people offline too – you can walk into a room full of strangers and leave with them all wanting to be part of Wrisk!<br /><br />*Have (some) design skills* - Content that engages often goes beyond the written word in isolation. We have some great design talent here already to support you, but you should also be comfortable producing supporting media to bring our messages to life.<br /><br />*Display good judgment* - You can parse the content coming out of our organization and determine what, how, and when, to share. You’ll also be our guide as to the best way to handle feedback from the audience (the negative as well as the positive), and guide us in how to respond in an appropriate fashion.<br /><br />*Have empathy and emotional intelligence* - Our community is likely to contain a bunch of different personalities. You can see the Wrisk brand from every perspective, and use this to guide your engagements. Insurance might seem dull until you need to make a claim, when emotions will be running very high. What we offer only truly becomes valuable during times of frustration, vulnerability and loss.<br /><br />*Be dedicated and committed* - Startups don’t run to the normal nine to five, and neither will our community.<br /><br />*Be highly organised* - Engagement occurs across multiple platforms and you can maintain conversations across all threads of activity. This will probably include scheduling content creation effectively, tracking and measuring feedback, and working out what works (and what doesn’t). You'll also need great organisation (and patience!) to extract content from our wider team; We all love what we do, but we aren’t all as great as you are, at talking about it!<br /><br />*Understand the importance of analytics and measurement* - To figure out which things are working and which aren’t, we employ the lean cycle of build, measure and learn. You can help us collectively define and measure the effectiveness of our campaigns in a similar way. There is often a difference in what people say and what they do - we need your eagle-eye for metrics so we can figure out what is actually going on.<br /><br />*Be an enabler for our community* - A community is not a one-way communications channel - we want genuine conversations so our audience’s voice is heard. We need people to become enthusiastic fans, and even co-creators, so we need to find creative ways to empower and reward them.<br /><br />*Be as passionate as the rest of us* - Passion and interest are not words typically associated with insurance, but you’ll be excited about the opportunity to affect change (just like us).<br /><br />*Embrace, and cultivate, our culture* - We take culture pretty seriously at Wrisk - but it’s especially important for our community manager, as you’ll so often be representing our company personality to our customers.<br /><br />*What you'll do...*<br /><br />* Become the company storyteller. Documenting the journey of our team and product through writing, images, video and anything else that might connect with our audience.<br /><br />* Set and implement your social media and communication campaigns to align with marketing strategies.<br /><br />* Help us clarify the drivers that trigger people to swap insurance providers (and figure out how to reach prospects in each state before that point).<br /><br />* Respond to community and customer queries in a timely and effective way.<br /><br />* Organize and participate in events to build community and boost brand awareness.<br /><br />* Act as the connector between the wider team and the community. Making sure to to stay updated on new product features and share feedback, questions etc.<br /><br />* Build relationships with customers, potential customers, industry professionals and journalists.<br /><br />* Encourage the wider team to contribute to the community and also help in the creation of specialist content.<br /><br /><br />*About you...*<br /><br />Some technical skills you'll be able to demonstrate…<br /><br />* The ability to bring together and engage our community across a variety of different channels including, but not solely, news publications, blogs, social media and face-to-face.<br /><br />* Social media expertise with sites like LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram (and be able to share knowledge about the pros and cons of different platforms).<br /><br />* Experience with setting up campaigns to advertise (with measurement and reporting of results) and optimising on key platforms, such as Facebook<br /><br />* Being able to work smartly - using a whole host of tools (e.g. Buffer, Quuu, Backly, Discourse, or whatever you favour).<br /><br /><br />If you want to be part of the team but you don’t quite fit the bill get in touch anyway. <br /><br />_Passion beats skills every time._ <br /><br />We firmly believe in equal opportunities for all.<br />We offer a competitive salary, generous holiday, and flexible working conditions.<br /><br />We're currently at  Tech Hub, Moorgate, part of Google for Entrepreneurs. As you would expect, it comes with the obligatory ping pong table, foosball table and free coffee, plus regular talks from luminaries of the startup and tech sector.<br /><br />Want to know more?<br /><br />Drop us a line and send us:<br /><br />* A link to learn more about you (your LinkedIn, your CV, etc.)<br />* Three things you would change about this job posting (typos, new requirements... anything, really)<br />* A sentence or two about why insurance sucks right now",

We’ve asked the question countless times – “what makes saving hard?”. The answer is friction, temptation and mediocre existing solutions. <br /><br />Plum is the intelligent savings assistant to solve this. By analysing your spending habits, Plum knows just how much to save and puts this aside for you automatically. It lives on the web and on Facebook Messenger as your ever-funny and trusted sidekick.<br /><br />Our team has a background in growing early stage startups to large established brands. Victor joined TransferWise when there were a handful of people in London and built the team that launched TransferWise in 25 countries.

We have the ability to give native apps to small and medium sized companies 90% cheaper than anyone on the market, and 90% faster (within just a couple of weeks).<br /><br />What we're looking for: <br />We're looking for a Commission Only Sales Agent, if you have experience in SaaS Sales, that's a bonus. You can be based from anywhere in the world. Your objective will be to target and identify retail/ecommerce outlets that you feel can do with a mobile app. There's many cool websites out there at the moment that have a great range of products,  but only a website presence. We're here to bring them new distribution channels via their own Personalised Apple and Android Mobile Apps. You will then be required to approach these SME's, sell our mobile technology and close the deal. It's really that simple. As for how to sell? We will leave this to you. It doesn't matter if you want to do email approaches, telesales, approach in person - that's all up to you. <br /><br />Experience Required: <br />Not essential in mobile apps, but definitely desirable (if you're tech savvy it helps in explaining why they can really boost their sales by having their own mobile app). We don't have a very strict criteria when it comes to selling. From our experience, a true sales person can sell anything. We're here to provide all the training you will require including material, objective handling etc. In return, your goal is to bring in the sales. <br /><br />Note: You will serve us as an external sales agent on a freelancing basis. <br /><br />Renumeration:<br />As an introductory offer (for 3 months), we're paying £3,000 per sale of the the technology - this has proved to be no issues as the tech itself is already 90% cheaper. After this commission will drop to £2,000 per sale. If you sell 4 a month, you can expect £12,000. <br /><br />We look forward to your applications! Please feel free to attach any questions with your CV, we will be in touch and answer the ones you have. If you have anyone you know who you think would be great for this role, feel free to share!",

Fast forward two years, we now have an industrial size central kitchen in Vauxhall and a range of 17 different products stocked in some 50 locations across London. So yes, we have been quite busy! And we are planning to be even busier!<br /><br />We have very ambitious plans for the next few years - going national in 2017, international in 2018, launching our own retail concept, etc. And that is exactly why we are looking for a UK Sales Manager to join our ever-expanding team and help us to achieve our dreams!

We’ve created an open and informal environment where people feel inspired and empowered to share their ideas and bring their best to work every day.
