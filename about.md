I'm Dmitri Geller, a software developer in Odessa/Ukraine responsible for just about everything on this site (including bugs). 

I’ve been developing software for the last two decades. I started in mid-90s in Odessa with Borland C++ 3.1 (yes, the pre-internet era, MS-DOS with the 640kb limitation and all the "fun" related to it). After this I worked in R&D of [LHS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LHS_Telekommunikation) in Frankfurt, developing a billing system for Telco operators in Java. I spent multiple years consulting the Telco operators running this billing system and after that returned to Odessa. After returning to Odessa I’ve working as a team lead and architect for US startups having development centers in Odessa (see [opower.com](https://opower.com), [slice.com](https://slice.com)).

Odessa is my home and a really nice city. But the most interesting software projects are coming from the valley (you know which valley I’m talking about, right?) and from similar places. I decided to find a remote job, and started to research. 

And I found [35 (remote) job boards](https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job#job-boards) and [9 aggregators](https://github.com/lukasz-madon/awesome-remote-job#job-boards-aggregators) . This is great. And still, no job board or aggregator distinguishing between the "true remote, work from wherever you want" and the "you can work remotely once a week" jobs. And, the Javascript, Java and, let say, Python jobs should be in different categories/sections, right? It seems, nobody cares.

So I made this site. The jobs containing "work from wherever you want" or the similar are tagged as "100% remote". The jobs with "you can work remotely once a week" or "may consider remote for a highly qualified candidate" are tagged with "50% remote". The Javascript, Java and, Python jobs go into different categories under "Developer jobs" - so you can just browse the category you need. Additionally, there are a few more things like tags for time zones (and work authorization, still under #TODO).

Enjoy (or loathe) it.



### Credits
I am very grateful to the authors of [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/core/) - they created a great instrument. 
A significant part of web crawling code is written by [Sergei Poznanski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergei-poznanski/) - without his support this project would not cover so many job boards.
